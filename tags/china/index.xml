      <description>It has been a while since my last post, thanks to the &amp;ldquo;madness&amp;rdquo; of travel and other affairs near the end of my first semester at The U. From March, I attended LAK in Poughkeepsie NY, AERA in Chicago, an educational discourse workshop in Ann Arbor, and CSCL in Gothenburg, Sweden. Before CSCL, I visited several cities in China, including Beijing where I talked with a group of talented grad students at Peking University and chatted in length with a colleague at Beijing Normal University; after CSCL, I visited a colleague &amp;amp; friend in Oslo and enjoyed a wonderful &amp;ldquo;Norway in a Nutshell&amp;rdquo; fjord trip.</description>
