Shum, S. B., &amp;amp; Ferguson, R. (2012). Social learning analytics. Educational Technology and Society, 15(3), 3–26.

Educational Data Mining (EDM) “an emerging discipline, concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from educational settings, and using those methods to better understand students, and the settings which they learn in” (Baker &amp;amp; Yacef, 2009).</description>
