      <description>Today I was attending a data visualization workshop organized by the KNAER Data Visualization project in collaboration with AERO. I was one of the presenters, including Paul Anisef, Rob Brown, Chris Conley and Cosmin Marmureanu. It was the first time I met with them in person although we have been working together for a few months already on data visualization.
The workshop went quite well, with around 60 participants mostly from school boards and the ministry of education.</description>
