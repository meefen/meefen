It was an honor to be invited to attend the AERA-NSF Workshop on Data Sharing and Research Transparency at the Article Publishing Stage in Washington, D.C. during July 25‚Äê27, 2017.

It&amp;rsquo;s only a half-day into the workshop but I&amp;rsquo;m already amazed by so many great thoughts from a full room of journal editors, program officers from funding agencies, and early career peers.</description>

There are tons of articles you can find online about digital workflow for academics, e.g., this post, this one, this post involving LaTeX, etc. For me, there are a few essential things I want to achieve in my workflow:
 Capture: Easily capture references from the Web, including Google Scholar, journal webpages, and my university library, into my personal reference library.</description>
