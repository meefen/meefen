Notes Literature review * the simplest form of conceptual change: enrichment&amp;ndash;accumulation on the level of specific theory * revision: reorganization of knowledge on the level of the framework theory&amp;mdash;so more difficult and need specific instruction * problem: students are not aware the contradiction, so tend to enrich rather than revise them.</description>

Abstract This study examined how individuals and peers process scientific information that contradicts what they believe and assessed the contribution of this activity to conceptual change. Participants included 54 students in Grade 9 and 54 students in Grade 12, who were randomly assigned to four conditions: (a) individual conflict, (b) peer conflict, &amp;copy; individual assimilation, and (d) peer assimilation.</description>

Notes Highlights The current study presents a microgenetic analysis and case study of one student’s processes of knowledge construction as he played a conceptually integrated digital game (SURGE Next) designed to support learning about Newtonian mechanics. (p. 2)</description>

Notes This book chapter systematically introduces Chi&amp;rsquo;s theory about conceptual change. She thinks misconceptions and conceptual change happen on three grain sizes: false beliefs, flawed mental models, and ontological miscatogerization. Therefore, instructions to promote conceptual change should also be conducted on those three levels.</description>
