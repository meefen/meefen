      <description>I started working on a tool called &#34;Promising Ideas tool,&#34; firstly named as &#34;Big Ideas tool,&#34; one and a half years ago. It is an add-on to Knowledge Forum (KF), a knowledge-building environment used in many kinds of settings but mostly in primary schools. The Promising Ideas tool is really simple in terms of functionality. It looks like a lite and KF-confined version of Diigo or SparTag.us, which are both used for people to tag important information on the Web and leave traces for later-comers for better browsing heuristics.</description>

      <description>Although I have been using the word “promisingness” in my writing and conversations since last year, I am still not 100% percent sure about the meaning of it. When we discuss this concept with primary school teachers, they also found it not easy to grasp, let alone young kids (however, we are teaching this concept to grade 3s). This situation is not surprising because promisingness is not even recognized as a word in many popular dictionaries.</description>
