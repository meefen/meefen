The universe is expanding, but at what price.
The Milky Way is a beauty, but at what price.
The Sun is shining, but at what price.
The Earth looks blue, but at what price.
All continents are moving, but at what price.
Civilizations boom, but at what price.
A wall defends &amp;lsquo;us&amp;rsquo;, but at what price.
Pyramids are built tall, but at what price.
Boats cross the ocean, but at what price.</description>
