Littlejohn, A., Hood, N., Milligan, C., &amp;amp; Mustain, P. (2016&amp;frasl;4). Learning in MOOCs: Motivations and self-regulated learning in MOOCs. The Internet and Higher Education, 29, 40â€“48.
Notes Nice research investigating SRL in MOOCs. Survey used for measuring SRL of learners; interviews were used to understand learners in greater details.
No use of clicklog data to triangulate these findings could be a future direction.
Highlights Massive open online courses (MOOCs) require individual learners to be able to self-regulate their learning, determining when and how they engage.</description>
