      <description>About forty years ago, Dr. James Finn gave a speech entitled &amp;ldquo;A Walk on the Altered Side&amp;rdquo; talking about an undergoing revolution in education powered by cutting edge technologies at that time, technologies that were best represented by computers. He opened up his discussion by quoting J. Robert Oppenheimer&amp;rsquo;s words,
 &amp;ldquo;One thing that is new is the prevalence of newness, the changing scale and scope of change itself, so that the world alters as we walk in it, so that the years of manâ€™s life measure not some small growth or rearrangement or moderation of what he learned in childhood, but a great upheaval.</description>
