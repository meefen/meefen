Highlights Two-mode data was collected by Davis et al. (1941) in theirclassic study on theparticipation of Southern women in social events and later by a variety of researchers studying interlocking directorates from the 1970s onwards (e.g., Stokman et al., 1985).</description>

Notes A great intro to two-mode SNA. Requires understanding of SNA basics.
Highlights In social network analysis, 2-mode data refers to data recording ties between two sets of entities. In this con- text, the term “mode” refers to a class of entities – typically called actors, nodes or vertices – whose members have so- cial ties with other members (in the 1-mode case) or with members of another class (in the 2-mode case).</description>

Highlights abstract This article examines the relationship between structural location (namely, degree centrality) and news media coverage. Our central hypothesis is that the network centrality of social movement actors is positively associated with the prevalence of actors being cited in the print news media.</description>

Notes Summarize: This paper introduces affiliation index, a new measure to characterize affiliation in a two-mode network. As the author nicely argues, this index is two-mode in nature, compared to centrality measures which are one-mode in nature and often borrowed to analyze two-mode networks. The author also introduces a family of affiliation indices and significance tests based on its binomial distribution.</description>
