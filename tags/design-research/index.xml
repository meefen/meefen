Clippings Although there is innovation in education it tends to be sporadic and discontinuous, with the result that innovative practices seldom win out against those with a long evolutionary history. (p. 1)
add a note here (p. 2)

Notes An important piece on design research articulating different types of theories in DR, as well as &amp;lsquo;twin intentions/goals&amp;rsquo; of advancing both design theories and domain theories in DR.
Highlights The emerging design research paradigm treats design as a strategy for developing and refining theories.</description>
