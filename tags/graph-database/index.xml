      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ver never liked the April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day, until this year when Reddit decided to launch a social experiment called Reddit Place.
The idea is simple. The whole world &amp;ndash; or all Reddit users &amp;ndash; were given a 999 x 999 blank canvas to draw on. Some simple rules apply:
 Each user could choose one pixel from 16 colors to place anywhere on the canvas. They could place as many pixels of as many colors as they wanted, but they had to wait a few minutes between placing each one.</description>
