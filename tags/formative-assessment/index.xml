      <description>I have been teaching an undergraduate course using Canvas this semester. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how it happened because I&amp;rsquo;m essentially a disbeliever in Learning Management Systems (LMS). I believe one&amp;rsquo;s learning should not be managed. &amp;ldquo;LMS is the minivan of Education,&amp;rdquo; says Phil Hill. Even better, &amp;ldquo;the LMS is more like a bus than a minivan - someone else is driving, it only travels on a pre-arranged route, the bus is often late but you still have to be on time because it won&amp;rsquo;t wait if you miss it&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; says Stephen Downes.</description>

Notes This paper reports an interesting SNA-based system that recommend peer helpers based on friendship statuses (&amp;lsquo;social context&amp;rsquo; as called by the authors) and results of &amp;lsquo;formative assessment&amp;rsquo; (i.e., results of a formative test; &amp;lsquo;knowledge context&amp;rsquo; as called by the authors). The tool, SNAFA, engages students in 1) self-report information including friendship statuses, 2) take a test, and 3) review recommended peer helpers to seek help.</description>
