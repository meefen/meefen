Notes This book on &amp;lsquo;education for innovation&amp;rsquo; is a fun read. Ideas presented in the book are mostly based on interviews and workshops with &amp;lsquo;innovators&amp;rsquo; and resonated with me. Chapter 4, which presents a framework that explains how skills experiences and environments relate to innovation, is of particular interest to me.</description>
