      <title>Automate for Whom?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working at a large public R1 university long enough &amp;ndash; 4 years &amp;ndash; to witness steady changes with technology installed in public restrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a newly installed automatic paper towel dispenser in our office building. As someone who tends to use 1 paper towel, I was very frustrated by the design that doesn&amp;rsquo;t keep me &amp;ndash; a user &amp;ndash; in the loop and forces me to use that much paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;automatic-towel-dispenser.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a picture of a fancy hand wash station I saw during last week&amp;rsquo;s conference travel. It neatly integrates a soap dispenser, a water tap, and a hand dryer together. There are at least three sensors built in this integrated system. It&amp;rsquo;s probably based on a zero-paper consumption philosophy, and has fundamentally transformed one&amp;rsquo;s hand-washing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;hand-wash-station.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to wonder: &lt;strong&gt;Whom does automation &amp;ndash; and an integrated automation system &amp;ndash; serve? Whom did the designers have in mind when designing these products?&lt;/strong&gt;  And finally, &lt;strong&gt;what lessons we can learn as designers of learning systems&lt;/strong&gt; (or using a new fancy title, as &lt;strong&gt;learning engineers&lt;/strong&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;
