  abstract = "Abstract Asynchronous online discussions are broadly used to
              support social learning. This paper reports on an undergraduate
              class's online discussion activities over one semester. Applying
              social network analysis, this study revealed a participation gap
              among students reflected by their varied levels of network
              prestige. The low-prestige group initiated equivalent volumes of
              interactions but were less reciprocated. In-depth analysis found
              the high-prestige group also advantageous in other network
              measures such as closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality,
              as well as the strength, persistence, and reciprocity of their
              ties. To probe potential explanations of the revealed gap, we
              further contrasted post content and posting behaviours between
              two groups. Results did not identify any significant differences
              in post content but found low-prestige students' participation
              less timely and more temporally compressed. This paper calls for
              attention to the participation gap in online discussions,
              microlevel temporal patterns of student activities, and practical
              means to scaffold student participation in asynchronous online
              discussions.",
