                   learning analytics, this paper introduces two cases of
                   applying the Value Sensitive Design methodology to learning
                   analytics design. The first study applied Value Sensitive
                   Design methods, specifically stakeholder analysis and value
                   analysis, to a conceptual investigation of an existing
                   learning analytics tool. This investigation uncovered a
                   number of values and value tensions, leading to design
                   trade-offs to be considered in future tool refinements. The
                   second study holistically applied Value Sensitive Design to
                   the design of a recommendation system for the Wikipedia
                   WikiProjects. To proactively consider values among
                   stakeholders, we derived a multi-stage design process that
                   included literature analysis, empirical investigations,
                   prototype development, community engagement, iterative
                   testing and refinement, and continuous evaluation. By
                   reporting on these two studies, this paper responds to a
                   need of practical means to support ethical considerations
                   and human values in learning analytics systems. These two
                   studies demonstrate that Value Sensitive Design could be a
                   viable approach for balancing a wide range of human
                   values---which encompass and go beyond ethical issues---in
                   learning analytics design.",
