  abstract  = "To support ethical considerations and system integrity in
               learning analytics, this paper introduces two cases of applying
               the Value Sensitive Design methodology to learning analytics
               design. The first study applied two methods of Value Sensitive
               Design, namely stakeholder analysis and value analysis, to a
               conceptual investigation of an existing learning analytics tool.
               This investigation uncovered a number of values and value
               tensions, leading to design trade-offs to be considered in
               future tool refinements. The second study holistically applied
               Value Sensitive Design to the design of a recommendation system
               for the Wikipedia WikiProjects. To proactively consider values
               among stakeholders, we derived a multi-stage design process that
               included literature analysis, empirical investigations,
               prototype development, community engagement, iterative testing
               and refinement, and continuous evaluation. By reporting on these
               two cases, this paper responds to a need of practical means to
               support ethical considerations and human values in learning
               analytics systems. These two cases demonstrate that Value
               Sensitive Design could be a viable approach for balancing a wide
               range of human values, which tend to encompass and surpass
               ethical issues, in learning analytics design.",
