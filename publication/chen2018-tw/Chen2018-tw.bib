 abstract = {Supporting collaborative discourse with discussion forums in a
typical Learning Management System (LMS) remains challenging.
This article reports on a design case of an ``unLMS'' approach,
which aimed to devise a networked learning environment not based
on an LMS for collaborative discourse in an online course. To
support such discourse, four design principles were proposed
based on the literature and then used to guide technological and
pedagogical designs. Following the principles, a networked
learning environment was configured by harnessing emerging
technologies of open textbooks, web annotation, and team
communication. The designed environment was piloted in the
online course. A survey was distributed at the end of the course
to investigate student perceptions of the design. Student
perceptions of the environment was overall positive in terms of
usefulness and ease of use, despite several suggested
refinements to improve the tool integration and to personalize
student discourse experiences.},
