## Project Summary

The IdeaMagnets project aims to make knowledge building in science classrooms more connected with public discourse and open science. To this end, we build a “bridge” between Hypothes.is, an open-source web annotation tool, and Knowledge Forum, the go-to knowledge-building environment designed for continual idea improvement. With the IdeaMagnets tool, learners create “idea magnets” in Knowledge Forum. These magnets are then used to pull ideas from the web.
