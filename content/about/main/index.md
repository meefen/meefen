  I am an associate professor in [Learning Sciences and Technologies](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/programs/learning-sciences-technology-phd) at the [University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/).  My research is at the intersection of the learning sciences, learning analytics, and network science. As a learning scientist and educational technologist, I strive to make learning a meaningful part of social participation for people of all backgrounds and circumstances. My scholarly inquiry integrates knowledge media design, software engineering, and data science methods to continually improve infrastructures for learning. Guided by design-based research and participatory design approaches, I aim to generate justice-oriented pedagogical designs, technological innovations, and empirical understandings of learning in authentic settings. 
  
  I sit on the editorial boards of a number of journals, including The Internet and Higher Education, and I was elected to the Executive Committee of the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) and the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) Committee of the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS). I also served as a program chair of the CSCL Conference of the 2022 ISLS Annual Meeting, and co-chaired the ISLS Membership Committee and the SoLAR Website Working Group. 

  Before joining Penn GSE, I was an associate professor in the College of Education and Human Development and co-director of the Learning Informatics Lab at the University of Minnesota.
