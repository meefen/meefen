  I am an Associate Professor in [Learning Technologies](https://lt.umn.edu/) and the Huebner Endowed Chair in Education & Technology at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I also co-direct the [Learning Informatics Lab](https://innovation.umn.edu/informatics/) of the [College of Education and Human Development](http://www.cehd.umn.edu/). My research is at the intersection of the learning sciences, learning analytics, and network science. I currently serve on the Executive Committee of the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) and the CSCL Committee of the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS). My work is broadly published in premier venues and funded by the National Science Foundation, Schmidt Futures, the Digital Learning for Development initiative, and the University of Minnesota.
