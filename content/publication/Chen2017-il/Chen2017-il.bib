 abstract = {ABSTRACTAs collaborative learning is actualized through evolving
dialogues, temporality inevitably matters for the analysis of
collaborative learning. This study attempts to uncover
sequential patterns that distinguish ``productive'' threads of
knowledge-building discourse. A database of Grade 1--6
knowledge-building discourse was first coded for the posts'
contribution types and discussion threads' productivity. Two
distinctive temporal analysis techniques -- Lag-sequential
Analysis (LsA) and Frequent Sequence Mining (FSM) -- were
subsequently applied to detecting sequential patterns among
contribution types that distinguish productive threads. The
findings of LsA indicated that threads that were characterized
by mere opinion-giving did not achieve much progress, while
threads having more transitions among questioning, obtaining
information, working with information, and theorizing were more
productive. FSM further uncovered from productive threads
distinguishing frequent sequences involving sustained
theorizing, integrated use of evidence, and problematization of
proposed theories. Based on the significance of studying
temporality in collaborative learning revealed in the study, we
advocate for more analytics tapping into temporality of
learning.},
