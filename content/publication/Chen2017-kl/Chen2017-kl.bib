 abstract = {The evaluation of promisingness is central to knowledge building
and knowledge creation but remains largely unexplored. As part
of a design-based research program to support promisingness
judgments, the present study implemented an intervention in a
sixth grade science class, with the goal of exploring the
potential of promisingness judgments to foster scientific
understanding and epistemic beliefs. Aided by a Promising Ideas
Tool and pedagogical supports designed for this intervention,
students explored the concept of promisingness, judged the
promisingness of their community ideas, and engaged in iterative
cycles of idea refinement. Results indicated that students were
capable of improving their understanding of promisingness and
making promisingness judgments deemed sensible by domain
experts. The conceptual understanding and epistemic beliefs
displayed by students improved over the course of the
intervention, and such improvement happened in tandem with
students' understanding of promisingness. The implications of
this exploratory study and future research are discussed.},
