 abstract = {Innovation and knowledge creation call for high-level epistemic
agency and design-mode thinking, two competencies beyond the
traditional scopes of schooling. In this paper, we discuss the
need for learning analytics to support these two competencies,
and more broadly, the demand for education for innovation. We
ground these arguments on a distinctive Knowledge Building
pedagogy that treats education as a knowledge-creation
enterprise. By critiquing current learning analytics for their
focus on static-state knowledge and skills, we argue for
agency-driven, choice-based analytics more attuned to higher
order competencies in innovation. We further describe ongoing
learning analytics initiatives that attend to these elements of
design. Prospects and challenges are discussed, as well as
broader issues regarding analytics for higher order competencies.},
