abstract = "In this study, we applied the regulatory focus theory todesign a feedback intervention to promote learning in anintroductory statistics course at a Midwestern public universityin the USA. In total, 67 students were randomly assigned toreceive feedback that either fitted or not fitted theirregulatory focus. Through the analysis of covariance, we foundthat students in the fit condition had better performance thanthe non-fit condition, and there was a significant interactionbetween the individual?s regulatory focus and the type offeedback received. Further analysis showed that this interactionwas significant only for the middle-performing students, but notfor the lower or higher achievers. Findings from this study haveimplications for feedback design in higher education classrooms."
