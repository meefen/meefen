 abstract = {ABSTRACTIn this study, we applied the regulatory focus theory to
design a feedback intervention to promote learning in an
introductory statistics course at a Midwestern public university
in the USA. In total, 67 students were randomly assigned to
receive feedback that either fitted or not fitted their
regulatory focus. Through the analysis of covariance, we found
that students in the fit condition had better performance than
the non-fit condition, and there was a significant interaction
between the individual?s regulatory focus and the type of
feedback received. Further analysis showed that this interaction
was significant only for the middle-performing students, but not
for the lower or higher achievers. Findings from this study have
implications for feedback design in higher education classrooms.},
