My research is at the intersection of the learning sciences, learning analytics, and network science. I sit on the editorial boards of a number of journals, including The Internet and Higher Education, and was elected to the Executive Committee of the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) and the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) Committee of the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS).
