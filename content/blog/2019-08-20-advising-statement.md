Following advice from a fantastic leadership coach from my university, I drafted a [statement of advising philosophy](https://advisingmatters.berkeley.edu/professional-development/writing-statement-advising-philosophy) in the past summer (yes the summer has already passed in MN). 

[**Here it is!**](https://via.hypothes.is/https://bodong.me/file/BChen_Advising_Statement.pdf)

Please feel free to leave suggestions via [Hypothesis annotations](https://web.hypothes.is/start/). 

The other project that I haven't accomplished this summer is to create a [Résumé of Failures](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html). Hope I don't need to wait for the next summer because that will be a big failure :).
