<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>Most definitions of attitude are similar to that proposed by Gagne and Briggs (1974: 62):&lsquo;An internal state which affects an individual&rsquo;s choice of action toward some object, person, or event&rsquo;. Little wonder, then, that the construct of &lsquo;attitude&rsquo; occupies a central place in current theory on participation in continuing (or adult) education (Cross 1981;Darkenwald and Merriam 1982; Houle1984; Rubenson 1977). Attitudes are deemed important not only in affecting adults&rsquo; participation in education, but also in determining their support of continuing education programmes in the community and workplace. (p. 2)</p>

<p>Measuring attitudes (p. 2)</p>

<p>Attitude measures (usually scales) are often poor predictors of behaviour. (p. 2)</p>

<p>Rokeach(1968)formulated theso-calledtwo-attitudetheory,whichhasgainedincreasing acceptance by attitude researchers. In brief, Rokeach postulates that social behaviour is affected by twotypes of attitude: attitude towards an object (Ao) and attitude towards the situation in which the object is encountered (As). (p. 2)</p>

<p>Attitude towards an object has not,by itself, been found to exhibit a consistent relationship with behaviour. Attitude towards the situation must also be measured (within the same scale) if the A-Bcorrespondence is to be maximized. (p. 2)</p>

<p>Seaman and Schroeder (1970), in one of the few studies of adult attitudes towards continuing education, found no relationship between attitudes and educational participation. (p. 3)</p>

<p>Blunt (1983) contracted a new Thurstone scale to measure attitudes towards adult education. He found small but significant correlations between attitude and years of schooling, social participation, socio-economic status, internal-external locus of control, and participation in adult learning activities. (p. 3)</p>

<p>The principal objective of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument to measure adults&rsquo; attitudes towards continuing education. (p. 3)</p>

<p>An attitude was defined according to Rokeach (1968:112) as &lsquo;a relatively enduring organization of beliefs around an object or situation predisposing one to respond in some preferential manner&rsquo;. (p. 4)</p>

<p>Attitude scale (p. 4)</p>

<p>The first step in the construction of the Adult Attitudes Toward Continuing Education Scale (AACES) was the creation of an item pool. (p. 4)</p>

<p>Thirty items were retained for a pilot instrument. (p. 4)</p>

<p>The pilot scale was completed by 93 adult volunteers of diverse sociodemographic make-up. (p. 4)</p>

<p>The final form of AACES has 22 items on a five point Likert scale. Seven items (as many as deemed pertinent) represent attitude-to-situation; the remaining items measure attitude-to-object. (p. 4)</p>

<p>Behavioural index (p. 5)</p>

<p>Consequently, a four-item Yes/No Bl was constructed. The first three items enquired about current participation, frequency of participation, and past participation; the last asked respondents if they had &lsquo;ever suggested to another adult that he or she participate in some form of continuing education&rsquo;. (p. 5)</p>

<p>The evidence presented above indicates that AACES is a valid and reliable unidimensional measure of adult attitudes towards continuing education. (p. 7)</p>
