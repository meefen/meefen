<p>the exciting combination of consumption and creation</p>

<ul>
<li>all video games are rule systems about shapes, movements, and combinations.</li>
<li>but what would happen if I gave each shape, movement, and combination of shapes in Tetris a meaning?</li>
<li>story elements: actors, actions; states, events</li>
<li>grammar</li>
</ul>

<p>games as literacy
  * what&rsquo;s the role of story in games?
  * Casovilia: story doesn&rsquo;t matter.
  * The primary thing here is the player&rsquo;s production of story elements, not a story per se (like Alucard kills a Sword Lord). But the little events you&rsquo;re doing. A set of acts, and a set of meanings not enough to create a deep story.
  * Video games allows players to have all kinds of choices, but designers cannot prepare every possible choices beforehand. So what makes video games playable is the players make meanings..
  * &ldquo;video games cannot be art.&rdquo; -someone
  * Gee disagrees.
  * The marriage of rules and story elements allows two quite different stories to exist: the Designer&rsquo;s story, and the virtual-real story (player&rsquo;s trajectory through the game).
  * the second one is more important.
  * everyone go through the game differently. the example of killing a lord in a game: different trajectory.
  * the example of WoW when players going back to a place, they thought about before. a personal history. building meanings when playing. personal trajectory. doesn&rsquo;t happen in reading books. so players&rsquo; story, own projection of their story important, not the designer of the games.
  * the possiblity of creating a world in which each person&rsquo;s trajectory is important; each person is different, each person lay down a deap past of his own that can be compared or contrasted with everyone else.</p>

<p>Cognitive approaches in games
  * modern psychology: emotional component in thinking
  * give information emotional charge &ndash;&gt; better stored and learning more deeply; emotional attachment
  * the problem of schooling
  * games can trigger emotions.</p>

<p>who is playing the game?
  * virtual and real characters. melding of computer character and person.
  * psychology: people feels go as far as body goes.
  * in games, control is part of deep pleasure.
  * virtual and real have their own skills.</p>

<p>Professional experience
  * army game
  * you command soldiers to do things
  * the characters know a lot of things. but you need to make the right command.
  * solders
  * i (player) can start from zero knowledge, to build my professional knowledge by playing. because they know a lot.
  * by the time of getting good at it, i contribute more.
  * constrains.
  * soldiers &lt;-militery experience &ndash;&gt; player
  * share professional expereince
  * start before competence</p>

<p>the good model of helping people develop professional knowledge. but only used in training people to kill.
not killing people, but things like urben planning</p>

<p>Three stories:
1. the designer&rsquo;s story
2. the virtual-real story
3. the virtual-real career story</p>

<p>giving children a career trajectory, of problem solving (love that!!)</p>

<p>Summary
  * triaval grammar
  * going deeper
  * give story of your own learning</p>

<ul>
<li>the example of Civilization players as gods</li>
<li>kids designing games designer of other people&rsquo;s learning; meta-knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>what&rsquo;s the grammar of KB?</p>

<ul>
<li>complex vocuabulary after Grade 4</li>
<li>adopt before 5</li>
</ul>
