<h2 id="portable-annotations-and-automation">Portable Annotations and Automation</h2>

<p>In the <a href="http://bodong.ch/blog/2016/09/22/paperpile-workflow-part-1.html">previous blog post</a>, I explained key elements of my academic workflow: easy capturing of references, file storage on the cloud, portable annotations produced while reading, automation, and collaborative writing at one place. I made a screencast to share my workflow involving elements of capturing, storing, and collaborative writing in Google Docs.</p>

<p>In preparation for this post, I recorded another video focusing on elements related to <em>portable annotations</em> and the <em>automation</em> of piecing information together for later retrieval. More detailed information about the R scripts and web hosting I mentioned in the video could be found on <a href="http://bodong.ch/notes/">this page</a>. The workflow could be further automated and optimized when Paperpile provides public APIs, which seems <a href="http://forum.paperpile.com/t/public-developer-api/918">possible in the future</a>.</p>

<h2 id="open-workflow">&ldquo;Open&rdquo; Workflow</h2>

<p>I hope this video could offer my two cents on academic workflow. However, you may find the practice of putting notes online bizarre. That&rsquo;s totally expected as safeguarding ideas and avoiding embarrassments are norms in most settings including academia. Why would one put such rough notes online anyway? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be embarrassing in case of half-baked (or pre-baked) commentaries? How they might be useful at all for other people? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be enough if I try to publish in Open Access journals or make various forms of my research &ldquo;products&rdquo; openly accessible? Those are all fair questions.</p>

<p>My choice of putting notes online was inspired by <a href="http://reganmian.net/blog/about-me/">Dr. Stian Håklev</a>, a close friend of mine at OISE and a strong advocate for Open Access, Open Education, and Open Scholarship. He was one of the original co-founders of <a href="http://p2pu.org/">Peer2Peer University</a> and studied Chinese National Top Level Courses (equivalent to MIT Courseware) for his master&rsquo;s thesis. As part of his commitment to Open Access, he wrote a bunch of Ruby scripts to power <a href="http://reganmian.net/wiki/doku.php">a wiki-based citation management system</a>, in addition to his ambition to only publish in OA journals. The idea of <strong>opening up the process</strong> or &ldquo;immature&rdquo; artifacts &ndash; instead of the final products (e.g., journal articles) &ndash; is attractive to me, and inspired me to settle on the current workflow/practice I&rsquo;m following.</p>

<p>It was a while ago when I noticed a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/reread-old-notes-to-spark-new-ideas-1694783233">LifeHacker article</a> citing <a href="http://bodong.ch/notes/2013/09/26/johnson2010.html">a note I shared about Steven Johnson&rsquo;s book</a> while I was still manually taking notes from readings in Mendeley.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/assets/article_images/notes-lifehacker.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Following the attribution link, the author of the LifeHacker article actually borrowed much information from <a href="http://99u.com/workbook/40681/catch-your-swarm">a post on 99U</a>, which originally cited my note.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/article_images/notes-9u.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Information travels. I was even more surprised that the LifeHacker article has been reblogged for dozens of times, and has also been spread on social media (Google+, Twitter and alike). And I had no idea things would unfold like this at the first place of posting the notes. There are other examples that I&rsquo;ll not mention here.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/article_images/notes-google.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Such an example may sound trivial but at least points out a possible way of public engagement for academics. Can you <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/08/sociologists-discuss-how-departments-should-consider-social-media-activity-and-other">tweet your way to tenure</a>? Maybe not, or not too soon. But publishing the final articles in the most prestigious journals should <em>not</em> be the only way. More openness with various stages of the academic workflow may catalyze public engagement. As Philip Cohen, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland at College Park <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/08/sociologists-discuss-how-departments-should-consider-social-media-activity-and-other">puts</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to value and reward openness in our routine work&hellip; Public engagement does not need to mean separate activities and products, but can mean taking a public-facing stance in our existing work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, if you are interested in promoting openness in academia &ndash; in whatever area &ndash; check out this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://openaccessweek.org/">International Open Access Week</a> during October 24 - 30, 2016. Go to a local event, or engage in a conversation online.</p>
