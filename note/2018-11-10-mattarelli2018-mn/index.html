<p>In crowd-based open innovation, organizations generally invite novel contributions from outside the boundaries of the firm via an online platform that enables a large, diverse network of contributors to participate. (p. 2)</p>

<p>only a few studies have started to address how work is coordinated within the crowd and how to design systems to support higher levels of innovation among crowdworkers. In particular, crowdworkers engaged with knowledge intensive and innovation activities in online platforms, such as Open Idea and Local Motors, are encouraged to collaborate intensively with each other (e.g., Fuller et al, 2011; Langner and Seidel, 2015) in co-creation processes, such as the joint creation of value by a network of diverse actors (Perks et al, 2012; Lusch and Nambinsan, 2015). (p. 2)</p>

<p>micro-level patterns of collaboration between knowledge workers impact innovation outcomes (e.g. Perry-Smith and Shalley, 2003) (p. 2)</p>

<p>we pose the following research question: How do co-creation processes unfold and predict submission quality in crowd-based open innovation and what is the role of the diversity of the crowd in this process? (p. 2)</p>

<p>Theoretical Background and Hypotheses (p. 2)</p>

<p>Crowd-based open innovation (p. 2)</p>

<p>Open innovation has been broadly defined to include flows of knowledge and ideas both into and outside of the organization (e.g. Dahlander and Gann, 2010; Lichtenthaler, 2011). (p. 2)</p>

<p>work has tended to focus on the firm (West et al., 2014) and not at the level of the workers called upon to enact these new forms of work. (p. 2)</p>

<p>As defined by Howe (2009), “crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined and generally large network of people in the form of an open call.” (p. 2)</p>

<p>Studies suggest, for example, that monetary payments, when available, increase motivation (e.g. Boudreau et al., 2014; Brabham, 2010, 2008), but that other intrinsic factors, such as being challenged by a complex problem (Boudreau et al., 2014), developing skills (e.g. Brabham, 2010), being identified with the community and forming friendships (e.g. Brabham, 2010; Langer and Seidel, 2015), and having fun (Brabham, 2008) are all equally or more important. (p. 2)</p>

<p>Although informative, most studies do not push beyond questions of individual motivation to understand the work itself and few consider how work is coordinated among individuals and what contributes to high quality submissions. (p. 3)</p>

<p>Unpacking co-creation processes in crowd-based open innovation (p. 3)</p>

<p>According to Perks et al. (2012) and Lusch and Nambinsan (2015), co-creation involves the joint creation of value. “Innovations are thus the outcomes of behaviors and interactions between individuals and organizations” (Perks et al., 2012: 935). (p. 3)</p>

<p>Thus, even if they have promising ideas for a challenge, creators are not always able, alone, to refine and develop them into coherent submissions (Kittur et al., 2013). (p. 3)</p>

<p>the theoretical framework proposed by Lusch and Nambisan (2015) underscores the importance of the processes that lead to knowledge integration within a network of heterogenous actors and calls for more research on the micro-dynamics of co-creation, e.g. on the different roles played by diverse actors. In a similar vein, Storbacka et al. (2016) call for more research on co-creation that unpacks how different actors engage with each other. (p. 3)</p>

<p>Fewer works, however, have examined how heterogeneous actors involved in co-creation collaborate among themselves, how this evolves over time, and the outcomes of these collaborative processes (see Lusch &amp; Nambisan, 2015; Storbacka et al., 2016). (p. 3)</p>

<p>One exception is the work of Perks et al. (2012), who investigated the micro-level processes of co-creation and identified two interaction patterns in a network of customers, suppliers, distributors, and intermediaries in the car insurance industry. They found, for example, that successful outcomes often involved high levels of intense interactions among contributors. (p. 3)</p>

<p>The literature on how creative workers build relationships (e.g., Perry-Smith and Shalley, 2003), interact and exchange feedback (e.g., Perlow, 1999; Harrison and Rouse, 2015; Hargadon and Bechky, 2006), and coordinate their efforts (e.g. Bechky, 2006) is well established and offers important insights into collaboration practices that foster innovative outcomes. (p. 3)</p>

<p>A handful of recent studies have also begun to examine interactions in teams composed of crowdworkers (e.g., Retelny et al., 2014; Valentine et al., 2017; Riedl and Wooley, 2017). (p. 4)</p>

<p>Riedl and Woolley also reported that more successful crowdsourcing teams were characterized by “synchrony” dynamics (p. 4)</p>

<p>Teams that exchanged more diverse information among team members also performed better. (p. 4)</p>

<p>but extant research leaves us without a clear understanding of which patterns and sequences of interactions, over time, exemplify co-creation, and their influence on innovation outcomes. The objective of our work is thus to unpack the concept of co-creation and identify the core interaction patterns, or “signatures” that make it successful. (p. 4)</p>

<p>Thus, we focus on how the co-creation patterns contribute to completion and refinement of ideas, i.e. on submission quality. (p. 4)</p>

<p>Hypotheses (p. 4)</p>

<p>H1 A submission is more likely to be of higher quality if, over time, the number of different contributors (sources) posting on a design idea decreases. (p. 5)</p>

<p>H2 A submission is more likely to be of higher quality if, over time, posts are coming from a smaller number of community members who emerge as proportionately dominant. (p. 5)</p>

<p>H3 A submission is less likely to be of higher quality if the creator is proportionally dominant, e.g. responsible for the majority of posts. (p. 5)</p>

<p>H4 A submission is more likely to be of higher quality if, over time, the creators’ responses to posts from community members escalates. (p. 6)</p>

<p>Data and Method (p. 6)</p>

<p>Research Context (p. 6)</p>

<p>Local Motors (LM) is a manufacturing company founded in 2007 with the initial aim of becoming the first organization developing an open-source car in collaboration with an online community. (p. 6)</p>

<p>LM was an ideal company for our study because crowd-based open innovation is a strategic emphasis, and they are engaged on a day-to-day basis with the contributions from their online community. (p. 6)</p>

<p>Data Collection (p. 6)</p>

<p>We collected data from multiple sources, both qualitative and quantitative, to have a rich and detailed understanding of community members’ behaviors. (p. 6)</p>

<p>Preliminary Interviews with Online Community Members and LM Community Managers (p. 6)</p>

<p>We conducted 13 preliminary interviews with 10 online community members, i.e., external contributors who participated in the challenges, and 3 LM community managers (p. 6)</p>

<p>These interviews were used exclusively as a foundation for the authors to better understand the context and make informed decisions about how to design our data collection and analysis (p. 6)</p>

<p>Data from the Online Platform on Project REDACTED and the Airbus Cargo Drone Challenge (p. 7)</p>

<p>We downloaded all data from the community’s message archives (web log of interactions) during the timeframe of the two contests (i.e., from the initial post of the design brief to the announcement of the winners). In particular, we collected data on all the interactions exchanged by 600 community members and employees during the online contest (consisting of more than 10.000 posts). We downloaded information about the sender of each posting, timing, subject, and message content. We also downloaded demographic and personal information about community members to use as controls. (p. 7)</p>

<p>Coding of Data from the Online Platform (p. 7)</p>

<p>we collected information on the timestamp, sender, entry, and content of every comment logged across all entries (p. 7)</p>

<p>if User A left a comment on Submission B at Time T, with Message K, we would log the observed data point as a tuple of information (A, B, T, K). Our full dataset is then a collection of such tuples, which are grouped by entry and sorted by the time of the post. (p. 7)</p>

<p>Sequence statistics (p. 7)</p>

<p>Put another way, we want to use numerical descriptions of past behavior, which we call signatures, to predict future behavior (Leenders, Contractor, &amp; DeChurch, 2016). (p. 7)</p>

<p>to examine these signatures or interaction patterns over time, we created sequence statistics that capture interaction events (posts) on a creator’s entry over the course of the design challenges. These measures are a post-by-post indicator of who is contributing to an entry. (p. 7)</p>

<p>Submission Quality (p. 7)</p>

<p>Table 1. Summary of Sequence Statistics (p. 8)</p>

<p>only 45% follow (p. 8)</p>

<p>ed the requirements and were considered ‘complete’ and thus accepted for evaluation. (p. 8)</p>

<p>Acceptance of a design for evaluation is therefore a proxy for submission quality, distinguishing between higher quality submissions (i.e. those meeting the requirements and being accepted for evaluation=1) and lower quality submissions (i.e. those not meeting the requirements and not being accepted for evaluation=0). (p. 8)</p>

<p>Relational Event Modeling Analysis (p. 9)</p>

<p>Explaining communication sequences (p. 9)</p>

<p>the relational event model (REM), which is a statistical framework for analyzing sequences of actions and interactions, or relational events (Butts 2008). (p. 9)</p>

<p>This model builds on temporal social network analytic techniques, but emphasizes the role of short-term linkages occurring in sequence (Quintane et al. 2013). We define the rate of activity by an individual 𝑖𝑖 on a particular forum 𝑗𝑗 as the following: (p. 9)</p>

<p>The resulting parameter estimates 𝜃𝜃 thus capture the overarching patterns observed across entries, as determined by the sequence statistics we previously defined. (p. 9)</p>

<p>Differentiating Quality Submissions (p. 9)</p>

<p>This approach is similar to the ANCOVA methodology used by Johnson and Faraj (2011) to delineate network patterns across online communities, as well as the moderation approach of Schecter et al. (2017) to characterize behaviors of teams based on variations in emergent constructs. (p. 9)</p>

<p>We differentiate our approach from a typical causal inference model; rather than predict the outcome as a function of some antecedents, we characterize an outcome by the underlying process associated with it. In this way, we avoid claiming that a pattern or measure is better or worse, or that a specific sequence leads to a specific result. Rather, we determine if specific variations in certain behaviors are systematically associated with different outcomes. (p. 10)</p>

<p>Results (p. 10)</p>

<p>Hypothesis Testing (p. 11)</p>

<p>To test our four main hypotheses, we conduct relational event analysis. We apply a step-wise approach in which we add additional model terms and determine if there is significant improvement in fit. Our first model (Model 1) contains only the main effects, measured across all entries. Our second model includes these main effects, but also includes number of posts, number of users, and competition version as crossentry controls (Model 2). Finally, our third model includes all prior terms and also differentiates between completed entries and those that were not completed (Model 3). The parameter results for these models are presented in Table 3. Based on reduction in deviance, AIC, and BIC values, we conclude that Model 3 provides the strongest fit to our data. (p. 11)</p>

<p>Looking first at the main effects (Model 3), we see that, overall, entries tended to have increased diversity over time. That is, over time, different contributors posting to creators’ entries escalated. (p. 11)</p>

<p>me, it is more likely that 41 quality submissions as compared to low quality submissions, over time, the diversity of contributors to the feedback originates from a smaller number of individuals (other than the creator) in high quality entries as compared to low quality entries,. This finding lends support to Hypothesis 1, suggesting escalating diversity across all submissions, but much less so in high quality submissions. Second, we find a positive and quality submissions (𝛽𝛽 = 1.57, 𝑝𝑝 &lt; 0.001). This result indicates that as interactions revolving around a significant tendency for centralization of contributors over time in high quality as compared with low 42 high-quality submission progresses, feedback is significantly more likely to originate from a small number high quality entries, the creator has a lower overall tendency to post, relative to other contributors (𝛽𝛽 = 44 We also performed additional analyses for robustness which are not included in this manuscript for sake of brevity. Specifically, we tested a variety of interaction terms, as well as a curvilinear effect for diversity. We found that none of the variance associated with these terms across entries explained variance in outcomes among the entries. Surprisingly, this analysis suggests that there is not a point at which increasing diversity has a positive effect. That is, even small amounts of increasing diversity over time were associated with lower submission quality. of active contributors, proving support for Hypothesis 2. Third, as hypothesized (H3), we observe that in −1.20, 𝑝𝑝 &lt; 0.001). In other words, for high quality submissions, the creator of an entry does not dominate to feedback more, over time, in high quality submissions, as compared with low quality submissions (𝛽𝛽 = 43 the discussion of their own idea. Finally, we find a positive and significant tendency for creators to respond 1.21, 𝑝𝑝 &lt; 0.001). Thus, as an entry accumulates more contributor feedback over time, creators of high quality submissions are more likely to respond to and engage with the feedback in the later stages of the context. This result lends support to Hypothesis 4. (p. 11)</p>

<p>Discussion (p. 12)</p>

<p>In doing so, we respond to the calls for more research on the micro-mechanisms of co-creation (e.g., Lusch and Nambisan; Storbacka et al., 2016). (p. 12)</p>

<p>With regard to diversity, our results show that there is a tendency in the overall sample for more unique contributors to flock to an entry over time, but the entries that are most successful have fewer contributors over time. (p. 13)</p>

<p>in high quality submissions, feedback to the creator tends to originate from a smaller number of individuals, and these individuals are significantly more active relative to other contributors as the project moves from idea generation to elaboration. (p. 13)</p>

<p>the creators of more successful submissions, while not dominating the discussion, are particularly responsive to feedback in later stages. (p. 13)</p>

<p>One of the primary contributions of this research is that we were able to detect different interaction patterns over time and their effects. (p. 13)</p>

<p>Finally, in analyzing the patterns of interactions between actors, we did not consider the role played by the content of the messages exchanged. (p. 14)</p>
