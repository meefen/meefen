      <title>A.I.与鸡头蛇怪</title>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.I.，也就是人工智能，已渗透到各个领域。它就像一个迅速膨胀的热气球，几乎所有人都在往里鼓气。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;网上报道，中国的人脸识别技术已让世界颤抖。警察戴上人脸识别墨镜，分分钟教“逃犯”做人。它像极了希腊神话里的“鸡头蛇怪”，必杀技是一对电眼，冷却时间为零。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Basilisk_aldrovandi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(图片来源：Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;然而，热气球不爆炸是因为有冷空气的平衡。鸡头蛇怪被杀死，是因为镜子里自己的眼神，或公鸡的一声啼鸣。&lt;/strong&gt; A.I.的发展，却需要这一套装备——包裹它的冷空气，能照请它的镜子，和一声声啼鸣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.I.也好，机器学习也罢，一个重要的特征是其输出结果不会“好过”输入数据。&lt;strong&gt;电脑算法是一种政治文化制品。&lt;/strong&gt; A.I.在被用于解决社会问题的同时，也被封装进了已有的社会文化现实、关系、及偏见。例如，2016年一篇名为《基于面部图像的自动犯罪性概率推断》的文章，试图运用机器学习分析1856张人脸照，从中提取能用来区分“罪犯”与“非罪犯”的面部特征。可不曾想，罪犯的照片来自警察局，而非罪犯的照片来自其个人页面。试想，哪类照片里的人更容易嘴角上扬？机器学习，难免会习得数据里的偏见。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其实这个文章的例子还好，因为文章作者带着追求学术的初衷，把研究的细节都公之于众。想想那些被封存于“黑箱”里的算法，它们运转着脸书上的动态墙、银行给的信用分、雇员的任免与晋升…… &lt;strong&gt;有A.I.的世界里没有乌托邦式的愿望。相反，当决策越来越多地被自动化、批量化时，我们需要更透明、更具反思性的机制。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eUw-v0X%2BL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(图片来源：Amazon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此时，面对A.I.热，我们需要给它周围包裹上一层冷空气，让它不致爆炸。再找来一面镜子，让它能看到自己，看到那些从人类继承下来的偏见。然后再让每个人学会“公鸡的啼鸣”，包括那些被A.I.束缚的人、因A.I.而收获便利的人、制造A.I.的人，让A.I.真正为更多的人谋福祉。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Ongoing Experiment: Public Scholarly Annotation</title>
      <link>/blog/2018-07-public-scholarly-annotation/</link>

      <description>
        

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-stories&#34;&gt;Background stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I value &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Scholarship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and have been practicing it for years &amp;ndash; both in terms of &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; it and &lt;em&gt;learning to do&lt;/em&gt; it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/houshuang&#34;&gt;Stian Haklev&lt;/a&gt;, an OER and Open Access champion, introduced me to this idea. He built a wiki-based workflow system, named &lt;em&gt;researchr&lt;/em&gt;, and convinced a few OISE friends, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://cresenciafong.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Cresencia Fong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://alisaacosta.com/&#34;&gt;Alisa Acosta&lt;/a&gt;, to share our annotations publicly, in a well-organized manner. For us, the benefits of using researchr are obvious: the system scaffolds the scholarly process of reading and annotating articles, as well as summarizing and organizing our notes. Its openness adds another important piece that&amp;rsquo;s a bit murkier. &lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to share out annotations publicly &amp;ndash; to academics who annotate, to authors of an annotated article, and to academia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pratim&#34;&gt;Pratim Sengupta&lt;/a&gt;, whose work was &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodong.ch/notes/2015-12-17-sengupta2015/&#34;&gt;annotated by myself&lt;/a&gt; when running a journal club with a dozen grad students, just gave me a chance to really ponder on these questions. He and his team&amp;rsquo;s work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/computing-in-public-computing-for-public-b722f60c9f98&#34;&gt;public computing&lt;/a&gt; inspires my evolving thinking on the value of openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thinking is also contextualized in my recent attendance to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iannotate.org/&#34;&gt;I Annotate&lt;/a&gt; conference and the idea of creating &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.hypothes.is/blog/a-coalition-of-scholarly-annotators/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;A Coalition for Scholarly Annotation&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; shared by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/judell&#34;&gt;Jon Udell&lt;/a&gt;. My key takeaway from the conference was that the web annotation community has been thinking deeply about web information, knowledge and workflows. Their work has generated nascent web standards, tools and practices that are making an impact on publishing, information &amp;lsquo;consumption&amp;rsquo;, and human collaboration on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;now-enters-this-blog-post&#34;&gt;Now enters this blog post&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will be an evolving document reflecting my ongoing thinking on &lt;em&gt;open scholarly annotation&lt;/em&gt;. Writing this blog post is a new experiment. I admit my bias upfront. That is, &lt;strong&gt;I strongly believe scholarly annotations generated at various stages of the scholarly process are of great value&lt;/strong&gt;. However, these annotations have become part of the &amp;lsquo;dark data&amp;rsquo; generated by scholars and are rarely talked about. While &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970&#34;&gt;research reproducibility&lt;/a&gt; has been embraced by many disciplines and scholarly communities, how we actually &amp;lsquo;annotate&amp;rsquo; each other&amp;rsquo;s ideas into new ones remains opaque. Remaining in the dark is not doing justice to hidden value we produce as scholars and is not helping with the training of emerging scholars. Further enriching openness in scholarly practices &amp;ndash; even beyond open data and analysis reproducibility &amp;ndash; would be a meaningful next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;phase-1-of-writing-this-post&#34;&gt;Phase 1 of writing this post&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Phase 1, I will publicly annotate web documents about &lt;em&gt;open scholarly annotation&lt;/em&gt;, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://hypothes.is/&#34;&gt;Hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; and a tag &lt;code&gt;ValueAnnotation&lt;/code&gt;. Below is an evolving collection of my annotations, and I invite you to annotate with me using the same tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; src=&#34;/images/article_images/hypothesis.html&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; --&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;600&#34; src=&#34;https://hypothes.is/search?q=tag:%22ValueAnnotation%22&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a Hypothesis annotation I created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/article_images/h-annotation.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;phase-2&#34;&gt;Phase 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an emerging process. The next step, as I see now, is to make sense of generated annotations and update this post with summaries and new ideas that &amp;lsquo;rise above&amp;rsquo; existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; (2018-7-20): In preparation for an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aera.net/Events-Meetings/Annual-Meeting/2019-Annual-Meeting-Theme&#34;&gt;AERA 2019&lt;/a&gt; submission, I wrote a research summary describing what I hope to do next. The summary &amp;ndash; embedded below &amp;ndash; is informed by Hypothesis annotations above. However, I found it difficult to demonstrate the &amp;lsquo;moves&amp;rsquo; from annotations to writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;600&#34; src=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2KgWL47pKHyfDr_YRnIbJEutWQynICTNxusVrsVXHFjyiTODXxU06mihU6kaHrqUJR8haky2kL3q-/pub&#34; frameborder=&#34;1&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be continued&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @National_Academies_of_Sciences2018-yf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Academies of Sciences, &amp;amp; Medicine. (2018). Envisioning the Data Science Discipline: The Undergraduate Perspective: Interim Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.17226/24886&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.17226/24886&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to manage, analyze, and extract knowledge from data is pervasive across industry, government, and academia. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nation’s ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new models for delivering education (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future data science programs will need to incorporate a variety of skills. Strong analytic skills are needed to work with large, complex data sets. Oral and written communication skills are also necessary to engage with diverse audiences about realworld problems, to work in teams, and to participate in effective problem solving for both technical and ethical dilemmas encountered in uses of data science. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using real data will expose students to the messiness they will confront when solving real-world problems. Selecting applications with broad impact will make instruction more compelling, helping to attract and retain students. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical curricular topics include mathematical foundations, computational thinking, statistical thinking, principles of effective data management, techniques for data description and curation, data modeling approaches, effective communication skills, reproducibility challenges and current best practices, exposure to ethical dilemmas and problem-solving skills, and a range of domain-specific topics. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“data acumen,” which enables data scientists to make good judgments and decisions with data. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;data science is inherently concerned with understanding and addressing real-world problems and challenges (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOX S.2 Questions for Public Input The committee has identified the following themes, which are discussed throughout this interim report, and is soliciting input on the open questions. Please visit the following webpage to provide input: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nas.edu/EnvisioningDS&#34;&gt;http://www.nas.edu/EnvisioningDS&lt;/a&gt;. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building Data Acumen in a Data Science Curriculum ● Which key components should be included in data science curriculum, both now and in the future? ● How could these components be prioritized or best conveyed for differing types of data science programs? ● How can opportunities to enhance data acumen (i.e., the ability to make good judgments and decisions with data) be integrated into data science educational programs? ● How can data acumen be measured or evaluated? (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oral and Written Communication Skills and Teamwork (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment and Evaluation (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new generation of tool developers and tool users will require the ability to make good judgments and decisions with data and use t (referred to as “ ools responsibly and effectively data acumen” throughout this report). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data scientists have the potential to help address critical real-world challenges. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current data science courses, programs, and degrees are highly variable in part because emerging educational approaches start from different institutional contexts, aim to reach students in different communities, address different challenges, and achieve different goals. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;programs are taking a cross-disciplinary approach—for example, integrating statistics and computer science concepts into the undergraduate data science degree program (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 explores the role of innovative curriculum development and provides some considerations for institutions. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K-12 objectives (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful historical analogy can be made with the Lewis and Clark expedition (1804–1806), which laid the foundation for great discoveries about a newly expanded nation through systematic data collection and analysis. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Acquiring Data Science Skills and Knowledge (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What skills are needed to be successful in the workplace and in society? Is data science a fundamental skill that all students should have some exposure to? How can data literacy be improved? In what skills, methods, and technologies should future data scientists be trained, given the wide variety of potential applications? (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding 2.1: A critical component of data science education is to guide students to develop data acumen. This requires exposure to key concepts in data science, real-world data and problems that can reinforce the limitations of tools, and ethical considerations that permeate many applications. Key concepts related to developing data acumen include the following: ● Mathematical foundations, ● Computational thinking, ● Statistical thinking, ● Data management, ● Data description and curation, ● Data modeling, ● Ethical problem solving, ● Communication and reproducibility, and ● Domain-specific considerations. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Data Science Education in the Future (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INNOVATIVE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although full degree-granting programs in data science may not be available yet in many settings outside top-tier academic institutions, graduates will still need to come from community colleges, minority-serving institutions, and smaller colleges and universities in order to fill the pipeline of data talent. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process whereby the goals are achieved can be varied. In terms of delivering content, flipped courses, hybrid courses, independent studies, experiential learning, modular courses, hackathons,1 data dives,2 and just-in-time learning are all viable options for students (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first step in establishing a new curriculum is to consider relevant experiences from other disciplines (e.g., the digital humanities) that have recently emerged from a period of reorganization and innovation. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 A “data dive” is an event in which organizations, often nonprofits, present a data-driven problem to a group with data science expertise to solve in a limited amount of time. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOX 3.1 Examples of Current Data Science Programs (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this, they mean changing teaching from a lecturebased format to one that has both inquiry-based and modular-learning components and that treats students as scientists who “develop hypotheses, design and conduct experiments, collect and interpret data, and write about their results” (Handelsman et al., 2004). (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoey (2008) suggests that the key measures include the following: ● Knowledge of concepts in the discipline; ● Ability to conduct independent research; ● Ability to use appropriate technologies; ● Ability to work with others, especially in teams; and ● Ability to teach others. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Broad Participation in Data Science (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data science programs have the potential to attract broad participation, including diverse members from different disciplines (including the humanities, social sciences, and the arts) and from populations that are underrepresented in other similar science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (see Box 4.1). (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;● CS for All3 is a program that aims to provide all U.S. students the opportunity to participate in computer science and computational thinking education in their schools at the K–12 levels. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 National Science Foundation, “CS for All,” &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17525/nsf17525.htm&#34;&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17525/nsf17525.htm&lt;/a&gt;, accessed August 21, 2017. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “pipeline” metaphor has been a standard means to consider the flow of students through a STEM curriculum, with “leakage” used to indicate that some students step out of this path and potentially move to others. It has been argued that this metaphor should be replaced by a “watershed” in which there are multiple flow pathways by which students may enter a degree program dependent upon their own backgrounds. For inherently interdisciplinary degree programs with multiple potential routes for student success, such a metaphor structures a more open, collaborative approach toward building programs that attract diverse students than a fixed pipeline metaphor. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K-12 OBJECTIVES (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elementary, middle, and high schools play an important role in developing data science education and preparing students to thrive in a modern workforce. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the practices called for in these standards include analyzing and interpreting data; using mathematics and computational thinking; and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Embedded in these practices are such skills as being able to (1) identify significant features and patterns in data through tabulation, graphical interpretation, visualization, and statistical analysis; (2) make and test predictions through constructing simulations and recognizing, expressing, and applying quantitative relationships; and (3) communicate orally or in writing using tables, diagrams, graphs, and equations (NRC, 2012, pp. 49-53). Through the adoption of these national standards, data scientists may be positioned to play a role in curriculum development by working with curriculum designers to ensure alignment between the practices highlighted above and the requisite skills that are needed upon entry into data science programs. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PUBLIC OUTREACH (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to efforts that could be achieved in formal educational spaces, there are outreach efforts to students in more informal spaces, including year-long afterschool programs, summer camps, high school internship programs, competitions, and websites designed to foster motivation and interest (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Farris2016-fz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farris, A. V., &amp;amp; Sengupta, P. (2016). Democratizing Children’s Computation: Learning Computational Science as Aesthetic Experience: Democratizing Children&amp;rsquo;s Computation. Educational Theory, 66(1-2), 279–296. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/edth.12168&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/edth.12168&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: Drawing on Dewey&amp;rsquo;s classic works (&lt;em&gt;Democracy and Education&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Art and Experience&lt;/em&gt;), the authors make an intriguing argument that learning computation should be seen as an &amp;lsquo;aesthetic experience&amp;rsquo;. This argument is based on a detailed discussion of ideas from Dewey, ideas from the philosophy of science, and challenges with introducing computation to K-12 classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From worked examples from the elementary grades, they highlight two criteria of students&amp;rsquo; aesthetic experiences in computing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuity across domain. That is, learning computation is not an isolated act but connects with other subjects areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing institutional aims and &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; aims. That is, learning computation is not only to learn computation per se but to achieve &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;, personally meaningful aims beyond prescribed curricula. Instead of fixating upon a single &amp;ldquo;tool&amp;rdquo;, multiple tools and modalities are mobilized to assist in students&amp;rsquo; expressive goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;: This essay is inspirational (not b/c I recently met with P. Sengupta). It greatly opens up the space of computational science education and shine a spotlight on learners (and their true aims) instead of numerous mandates of CS4All.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aesthetic dimension, as well as the unity of science and art, should be addressed more often in K12 classrooms (and education at all levels + the public discourse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: I will continue to grapple with these ideas&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a democratic approach to children’s computing education in a science class must focus on the aesthetics of children’s experience. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Art as Experience, Dewey presents aesthetic experience as the fundamental form of human experience that undergirds all other forms of experiences and that can bring together multiple forms of experiences, locating this form of experience in the work of artists. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dewey calls the process through which a person transforms a material into an expressive medium an aesthetic experience.&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing computational literacy requires developing epistemic and representational practices such as thinking algo- rithmically, and designing and creating computational artifacts such as programs and simulations. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several scholars have argued that increasing access to computa- tional literacy for children in the realm of public education involves integrating computation within existing courses such as science and math that all children are required to take (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uri Wilensky, Corey E. Brady, and Michael S. Horn, “Fostering Computational Literacy in Science Classrooms,” Communications of the ACM 57, no. 8 (2014): 24–28 (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;must involve efforts to create computing in the image of children’s lives, and not vice versa (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this essay, we argue — in part by example — that an effective and democratic approach to children’s computing education within a science class can and must focus on the aesthetics of children’s experience. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Dewey, the value of educational experiences lies in “the unity or integrity of experience” (DE, 257). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he claims that aesthetic experience can bring together multiple forms of experience. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We extend Higgins’s argument by claiming that aesthetic education should not only be exemplified by the arts, but it must also bring computing and science education into its fold. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Aesthetics in Professional Science and K–12 STEM (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophers and historians of science agree that beauty and aesthetics play an epistemic role in the development of scientific knowledge (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gideon Engler main- tained that the beauty associated with Einstein’s theories, which was also widely acknowledged by his peers, can be understood in light of the following aesthetic qualities: simplicity, symmetry (including invariance, equivalence, and covari- ance), unification (unity), and fundamentality.8 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the aesthetic proper- ties of theories (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cannot help linking Kuhn&amp;rsquo;s work and my work on promisingness of ideas/theories in learner communities. Have not thought about aesthetic properties earlier.  (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophers of science have also asserted the importance of scientists’ interpretive work in the production scientific knowledge, including scientific inscriptions, such as drawings, diagrams, photographic images, and computer visu- alizations. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their critique of objectivity in the sciences, Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison argue that the pro- duction of inscriptions in science reflect the values and the epistemology of the scientific culture in which they are made.13 (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progressive centrality of computation in current scientific practice has further transformed the epistemological nature of science. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little, if any, understanding of the aesthetic dimensions of scientific practice, as well as the journey of “becoming” a scientist. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They locate aesthetics in the classroom dis- course, and they present guidelines for teaching science as an aesthetic experience by proposing forms of questions that teachers could ask students (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lemke argues that central to this account of the transformative nature of experience in the production of scientific knowledge is “the vital fusion of theory and experiment (or observation) that makes science truly a performance art,” which science education has failed to address in an authentic fashion. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at the heart of scientific progress is the “dance of agency” between theories and instrumentation.19 However, Pickering’s work does not address the dimensions of the scientists’ affective involvement and personal meaningfulness, which are also essential elements of Deweyan aesthetic experiences. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to such heightened forms of engagement and experiences lie the learning experiences of the disempowered and the disinterested, who are typically left out of the fold of deep engagement with the curricular content in most classrooms.21 (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay Lemke, “Articulating Communities: Sociocultural Perspectives on Science Education,” Journal of Research on Science Teaching 38, no. 3 (2001): 300–01. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;most of whom do not identify themselves as computing- or STEM-competent, even at the college level.22 (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;such students will develop a deep interest in their curricular work and (in the context of learning science) come to see that work as both scientifically and personally meaningful (see DE, for example, 128 and 227–39) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore ask the following question: What is the nature and role of aesthetic experiences for such students in the context of doing computational science? (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratizing Science and Computing Education: The Nature and Role of Aesthetic Experiences (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieving coherence between the learners’ interest, or what Dewey terms “true aims,” and pedagogical aims would foster continuity of the pedagogical experience with the learners’ experiences outside the classroom (DE, chap. 8).&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Dewey, “the measure of the value of an experience lies in the perception of relationships or continuities to which it leads up” (DE, 147). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curricular domains of knowledge are institutions that are disconnected from each other (DE, 294–97), and this iso- lation of curricular experiences “rupture[s] &amp;hellip; the intimate association” between domains of knowledge as experienced by the learner in a continuous form in his or her everyday life outside the classroom (DE, 295). Dewey considers this a serious breach in the learners’ continuity of mental development because this makes the curricular experience unreal for the learner and can therefore lead to a loss of interest. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher, Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He locates the paradigm of such experiences in the artist and claims that aesthetic experiences arise in the artist’s process of trans- formation of a material into an expressive medium (AE, 111–13). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this interpenetrative nature that makes aesthetic experiences fundamen- tal, in that they transcend domains of knowledge and represent the unity of expe- rience through which the object becomes expressive and personally meaningful to the artist. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of computational programs that underlie any usable software (or application) involves the use of computational abstractions,25 that is, representational structures that are domain-general (for example, algorithms, data structures such as lists and arrays, and so on). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essential nature of the practice of com- putation is therefore transformative. To put this in Dewey’s terms, the material of computation — typically, a programming language — gets transformed into an expressive object, specifically a software application that has value because of its usability and meaningfulness in other domains. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second reason concerns Dewey’s emphasis on the continuity of learning experiences for a democratic education. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past three decades, research on making agent-based computation accessible to young learners has identified several activity forms that can poten- tially support interest-driven computing. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new forms of activities within which programming is embedded: game design,26 digital narratives,27 digital animations of sketches and graphic design,28 and integration of programming with physical computing and the use of low-tech objects.29 (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, as the learners (in these studies) engage in the development of multiple, personally meaningful representations of the object of inquiry, they begin to “see” the unknown through using experiences that are personally meaningful and familiar. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchel Resnick, John Maloney, Andrés Monroy-Hernández, Natalie Rusk, Evelyn Eastmond, Karen Brennan, Amon Millner, et al., “Scratch: Programming for All,”Communications of the ACM 52, no. 11 (2009): 60–67. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, taken together, these studies suggest that computation, and in particular agent-based computation, is indeed a malleable medium that can lend itself to multiple activity forms, and further, that certain forms of computa- tion might even bring together multiple domains within the act of learning. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, we argue that the transformative and fundamental nature of aesthetic experiences can provide useful guidelines for designing an inclusive and democratic pedagogy for kids’ computing (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;should provide learners opportunities to transform a material (for example, a computational programming language) into an expressive medium. In the context of computing education, this means that the learner should be able to create a personally meaningful artifact. This in turn requires balancing the learners’ interests or true aims with institutionally man- dated aims that instructors have to abide by. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the second dimension, the fundamental nature of aesthetic experiences implies that the learning experi- ence must also be continuous. That is, it should also enable learners to connect the present experience with their lived experiences outside the classroom and to bridge different domains that are traditionally taught as ontologically distinct from one another. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Worked Example (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that our goal was to reframe learning computational science as an aesthetic experience; therefore, we intentionally integrated multiple domains and tools in our pedagogy. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Tools”: ViMAP and TuneBlocks (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ViMAP (see Figure 1) is an agent-based visual programming language and mod- eling platform34 that uses NetLogo as the simulation engine.35 (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Episode 1: Programming “Thomas” (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ariana began writing a ViMAP program to make the turtle write “Thomas” (Figure 3). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ariana: The fourth Thomas is my best friend, the third Thomas is from The Maze Runner, and the second Thomas is the Maze Runner’s dad, and the first Thomas is Thomas Edison, the scientist. And this will be our fifth Thomas, our little turtle here. And he is so good. He is going to preschool and he is knowing how to spell his name. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we highlight the two key criteria of an aesthetic experience that are central to a democratic education&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuity across Domains. In Ariana’s work, geometry and programming were deeply intertwined with one another. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing Institutional Aims and True Aims. Ariana’s project shows that the computational agent (the turtle) truly became a transitional object — that is, she projected her identity onto the turtle. Her way of learning programming was by making the turtle learn how to write Thomas. This in turn transformed the material (ViMAP) and the activity (learning programming by drawing letters) into a means to talk about her serendipitous encounters with the many Thomases in her life: literary figures, historical figures, and friends. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Episode 2: A Collaborative, Multimodal Model of Acceleration (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuity across Domains. In this episode, learning about the physics of motion — that is, learning to represent motion as a process of continuous change — was deeply intertwined with the use of programming and musical notations. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing Institutional and True Aims. The multimodality in Ariana and Matt’s models illustrate children’s agency in interpreting and symbolizing scientific ideas (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can the disinterested find their voices in the STEM classroom, especially in classrooms where computation is the medium of “doing” science? (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is, the democratization of computing hinges on designing pedagogies that enable the learner, especially the disinterested learner, to transform the computer as a material into an expressive medium in a manner that can create a fundamental and unifying experience.&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can therefore provide children entrée into anewkind of science, where the mundane is reimagined and (re)represented as complex, and children’s true aims find a place alongside the institutionally mandated aims. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dewey argues that the habitual nature of art is such that it helps us “see” complexity in the world of our everyday experiences, the mundane. He wrote, “Art throws off the covers that hide the expressiveness of experienced things” (AE, 110). (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many Thomases in Ariana’s life and Matt’s experience of his daily car rides as well as his aspiration to be an actor are repre- sentations of children’s interests and Deweyan “true aims” that are typically left behind in pedagogical time. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the “value” of a democratic education lies in the unity (or integrity) of experience. The essence of technology being nothing technological,39 we believe that the unity of experience, which Dewey argued to be at the heart of aes- thetic experience, is truly the essence of democratizing children’s computational science. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose a model theorising social media as a space for learning with varying attributes of formality and informality. Through two contrasting case studies we apply our model together with social constructivism and connectivism as theoretical lenses through which to tease out the complexities of learning in various settings. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of social media include social network sites (eg., Facebook); wikis (eg., wikispaces); media- sharing services (eg., YouTube); blogging tools (eg., Blogger); micro-blogging services (eg., Twitter); social bookmarking (eg., Delicious); bibliographic management tools (eg., Zotero); and presentation-sharing tools (eg., Slideshare) (Gruzd, Staves and Wilk 2012). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others argue that only a small proportion of young people are actually using social media in sophisticated ways that educators might value (Eynon and Malmberg 2011; Ito et al. 2008). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using ideas derived from social constructivism and connectivism as promising initial lenses through which to conceptualize social media and learning, this paper problematises ‘learning’ and ‘teaching’ across multiple contexts, illustrating the complex relationships between formal, non-formal, and informal learning. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on social media in education (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;t integrating social media in learning and teaching environments may yield new forms of inquiry, communication, collaboration, identity work, or have positive cognitive, social, and emotional impacts (Gao, Luo and Zhang 2012; Greenhow, Burton and Robelia 2011; Greenhow and Robelia 2009a, 2009b; Pimmer, Linxen and Grohbiel 2012; Ranieri, Manca and Fini 2012). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many studies consider appropriation of social media within ‘formal’ and/or ‘informal’ learning, but in most cases these terms are under-theorized or treated as binary conditions, which oversimplify the complexities of the actual learning contexts today’s youth inhabit. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some researchers suggest that appropriating social media can facilitate ‘seamless’ integration across learning situations (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;integrating formal and informal learning (Dabbagh and Kitsantas 2012). Others highlight the challenges of appropriation (Crook 2012). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theorising social media as a space for learning (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is known resides not only in the individual, a position advanced by cognitive constructivists, but also in the collaboration and interaction among many (Vygotsky 1978; Windshitl 2002). Conceptually, social media practices seem well aligned with social constructivist views of learning as participation in a social context and values of knowledge as decentralized, accessible, and co-constructed among a broad base of users (Dede 2008); ‘ knowledge’ may become ‘collective agreement’ that ‘combines facts with other dimensions of human experience’ (ie., opinions, values) (Dede 2008, 80). Validity of knowledge in social media environments can be negotiated through peer review in an engaged community, and expertise involves understanding disputes and offering syntheses accepted by the community (Dede 2008). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;onnectivis t ideas (Siemens 2005), which view learning as the process of creating connections and articulating a network with nodes and relationships, also seems well aligned with social media practices. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the connectivist perspective, being knowledgeable can be seen as the ability to nurture, maintain, and traverse network connections; to access and use specialized information sources just-in-time; and as the ‘capacity to know more’ rather than the individual’s ability to construct meaning from prior knowledge, or ‘what is currently known’ (Siemens 2005, 4). Connectivism allows for non-linearity, unintentioned ‘ chaos’ and unanticipated network effects in the learning process as learning occurs within ‘nebulous environments of shifting core elements – not entirely under the control of the individual’ (2005, 4). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlying these ideas are assumptions that boundaries between learning in and out of ‘formal’ education can be porous, slippery and perplexing (Barron 2004, 2006). Definitions of formal and informal (and non-formal) learning are contested and the interrelationships are complex (Colley, Hodkinson, and Malcolm 2003; Sefton-Green 2004; Selwyn 2007). Some models attempt to draw clear boundaries between each term (EC 2001; Livingstone 2001; Eshach 2007) whilst others suggest that informal and formal learning are on a continuum (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Lai, Khaddage, and Knezek 2013; Sefton-Green 2004). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colley and colleagues suggest that it is impossible and unhelpful to separate informal, non-formal and formal learning (2003) at all. Rather they argue that ‘It is more sensible to see attributes of formality and informality as present in all learning situations’ (2003: Executive Summary, emphasis as in original). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They describe an approach to considering the attribute balances which focuses on purpose (intentional/unintentional), process (structure, pedagogy, support, assessment, etc.), location (including norms and structures such as timetables in educational institutions), and content (high stakes knowledge to leisure interests). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informal learning is described as that which is not directed by school or externally mandated but is learner controlled (eg., Ferguson et al. 2014; Luckin et al. 2009; Tan 2013;), exploratory, self-directed and spontaneous (Dabbagh and Kitsantas 2012; Mardis 2013; Yang, Crook, and O’Malley 2013). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notions of informal learning are often compared with non-formal, not-school learning where one has certain objectives in mind (self-directed learning) and actively seeks information from sources that may include peers, mentors, or media (Sefton-Green 2004; 2013). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;formal learning situations in which some agent - a teacher, an educational software program, or a learning management system - is directing the student’s learning. The agent guides the student through a formalized set of objectives typically generated by an outside authority, such as curriculum standards developed by professional organizations or mandated by the government. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Table 1 we outline our model for theorizing social media as a space for learning with varying attributes of formality and informality. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blurring boundaries: Digital cultures outside and digital practices within educational institutions (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;important to conceive of learning with varying attributes of formality and informality as pedagogical practices drawing on aspects of formal and informal learning become more commonplace (Weigel, James, and Gardner 2009). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that young people are engaging in a variety of digital practices with social media. For example, Ito and colleagues (Ito et al. 2013, 6) present case studies of ‘connected learning,’ defined as ‘learning that is socially-embedded, interest- driven, and oriented toward educational, economic or political opportunity.’ (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples suggest that technology has the potential to disrupt the boundaries between sites where learning takes place. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, to illustrate the theoretical model (Table 1), we present two research projects focusing on young people’s uses of social media for learning with varying attributes of formality and informality. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interrogating social media as space for learning: applying our theoretical model to empirical data (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first study (Lewin and McNicol 2014), which focused on mechanisms to transform and scale-up the use of technology in compulsory education, teachers in primary and secondary schools from 20 different countries were provided with resources and processes to stimulate technology-enabled pedagogical innovation. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;social media tools, such as Facebook, blogs and wikis, were recommended to teachers to support learning activities such as collaboration and communication. The evaluation took place over five cycles of activity (2011-2014) and involved teacher surveys and case studies of resulting projects. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second study (Greenhow 2011; Robelia, Greenhow, and Burton 2011), conducted with young people, aged 16-25, in the USA, explored the nature of young people’s use of a Facebook application called Hot Dish in their everyday lives. The application was designed in 2009 to accommodate young people’s knowledge-sharing about environmental science issues and provide opportunities to participate in civic actions related to global warming and climate change. Of the 1,100 registered members, 322 users opted into the study and voluntarily used the application. Participants were observed regularly over two months. Data were collected in the form of online surveys; online focus groups (n=16) and semi-structured interviews (n=12) with a purposeful sample of high/medium/low users; online comment strings in response to articles (related to environmental science); and from online statistics (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European study: Embedding social media in formal education (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Innovative Technologies for an Engaging Classroom (iTEC) project took place from September 2010 to August 2014. It focused on education in school contexts, primarily targeting learners aged between 7 and 14. In the first 4 of 5 cycles, teachers from 20 European countries were provided with resources to support pedagogical innovation with technology. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all four cycles, social media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, wikis, etc.) were suggested in three out of five learning activities and thus were central to the pedagogical changes recommended to teachers. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an emphasis on collaboration, communication and creativity, as well as digital literacy; social media, with its affordances mentioned earlier, seems well positioned to support such skills in the classroom. Therefore, through the project, teachers were encouraged to adopt social learning approaches supported by a range of social media tools. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, social media were used by students for a number of purposes (primarily for teacher-initiated, intentional learning): (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Managing group work (finding partners, forming groups, sharing tasks)  Generating ideas  Communication with peers and teachers (group discussion, asking questions, receiving feedback)  Sharing information, resources and links  Documenting and communicating progress (sometimes to audiences beyond the classroom)  Sharing project outcomes such as presentations  Assessment and evaluation (peer, teacher) (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cycle 3, blogs were specifically promoted with 56% of teachers (n=334) reporting that students had used them to support their projects. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Italy, in cycle 4, a teacher of Science at a secondary school decided to run a project over six weeks. The topic was volcanoes and teams of students were asked to design and produce prototype learning objects in game formats to convey knowledge to other students. The students decided what to focus on and how to present the learning (some aspects of the process were student-led). Initial proposals were discussed and refined within and between groups through the use of blogs and a closed Facebook site (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisiting the data through a new lens (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to facilitate intentional learning and determined externally (by the teacher). However, with greater autonomy, students helped to shape the learning activities; thus aspects were self- determined and also socially determined as they predominantly worked in groups. In relation to process, to varying degrees, teachers gave greater autonomy and control to their students. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example highlights the complexities of teasing out formal and informal attributes of learning and the limitations of reducing formal and informal learning to binary opposites. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USA study: Examining the digital culture of an environmental science-oriented Facebook application (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participating in civic actions (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot Dish offered 56 different challenges to help users become involved in enacting pro-environmental (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;changes in the community; Hot Dish users completed 1523 of these problem-solving challenges, about 25% of which were from the category of challenges known as activism in the local community. Local activism challenges included attending a town meeting, writing a letter to the editor of a local paper, writing a local lawmaker, attending events to network with environmentally minded others, starting an environmental group or recycling program, volunteering for an environmental group, and taking part in Earth Day, a worldwide awareness-raising event. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social aspects of Hot Dish motivated young people to participate and contribute more to this site than to other websites they frequented. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participating in issue-oriented debate (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the study period, young people on Hot Dish read 2103 articles, 89% of the total possible; they contributed 2153 comments. Of these, 220 articles included three or more comment strings. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether and how young people actually engaged in substantive debate about the focal topic - a goal for users when designing the app - these comment strings were coded for evidence of argumentation about environmental issues (Greenhow, Menzer, and Gibbins 2015); extending an argumentation coding system originally designed for ‘ formal’ computer-supported collaborative learning environments (Sadler, Barab, and Scott 2006; Weinberger and Fischer 2006), comments strings were coded for four argumentation dimensions: participation, epistemic, argument, and social co- construction skills. Results indicated that these three skill subsets were also evident in the Hot Dish environment at relatively high rates. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisiting the data through a new lens (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e see that this case demonstrates the use of social media for varied purposes; young people were intentional in seeking to interact with like-minded people and contribute, as well as consider, others’ ideas about a shared interest: environmental issues. However, their learning was also unintentional and socially determined; seeing others in the Hot Dish network perform civic actions sparked people’s intention and awareness of how they, too, could contribute, and in turn, they engaged. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of process, learning was self-initiated and self-directed as young people chose which articles to debate and which actions to perform, if any. The process of learning was also peer influenced as the analysis of argumentation clearly showed how individual’s comments, such as a consensus-building comment or counterargument shaped the dialogue that was constructed (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expertise in Hot Dish was both pre-authorized and negotiated. The educational technologists evaluated documented completions of civic actions and awarded points, and the magazine editors determined, in part, what articles the community read. On the other hand, expertise was negotiated through participation. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we see that the location for learning was in some ways open-ended and not time- dependent, but in other ways, fixed in time. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piggy -backing on young people’s existing, regular Facebooking activities (their digital cultural practices), Hot Dish provided an outlet to move beyond social networking mainly for socializing to debating socio-scientific issues of common interest, collaboratively pursuing civic actions, and networking related to their school- or career interests. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges to appropriating this or similar social media relate to the structures required to ensure success including development, technical support, and assessment. For example, assessing whether or not, and how well, young people had documented their completed civic actions required the team to constantly monitor the site and provide feedback in a timely manner so that users would see their point awards. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media has unique and powerful features, readily facilitating connections to others (Ito et al. 2013; Siemens 2005) through sharing and community evaluation, leading to participatory engagement in effective, multimodal learning communities. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We n eed more research-and-design projects, like the US study, in which learning technology designs are grounded in the competencies that educators value (e.g., socio-scientific argumentation, civic engagement, and modern scientific literacy) but open-ended and user-driven to enable participatory cultures to emerge. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was included in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mndaily.com/article/2018/04/n-university-of-minnesota-professors-use-their-free-time-to-write-free-textbooks&#34;&gt;an &lt;em&gt;MN Daily&lt;/em&gt; story about open textbooks&lt;/a&gt; last week. It was actually a bit embarrassing as I thought a few other colleagues would ‘co-star’ with me in this story because there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.cehd.umn.edu/otn/&#34;&gt;exciting work on open textbooks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lib.umn.edu/elearning/partnership/showcase&#34;&gt;affordable content&lt;/a&gt; going on at UMN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;University of Minnesota professors use their free time to write free textbooks: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/iCgMCxC3qf&#34;&gt;https://t.co/iCgMCxC3qf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mndailynews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@mndailynews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bod0ng?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@bod0ng&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dernst?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@dernst&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/UMNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@UMNews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/UMNproud?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#UMNproud&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CEHD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#CEHD&lt;/a&gt; Learn more: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/eydHtKE8Em&#34;&gt;https://t.co/eydHtKE8Em&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/open_textbooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@open_textbooks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/oer?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#oer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LTMediaLab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@LTMediaLab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/UMN_CI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@UMN_CI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/zweg5n1FB5&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zweg5n1FB5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; U of Minnesota CEHD (@UMN_CEHD) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/UMN_CEHD/status/986960692468178944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I’d like to share some personal thoughts that were not included in the news story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-textbooks-personal-reasons-of-using-them&#34;&gt;Open textbooks: Personal reasons of using them&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of textbooks in the US (and Canada) is ridiculous. I am not knowledgeable enough to explain why. But I had lived experiences with buying bulky textbooks for $200 and using them as laptop stands after a single use. They are from respected textbook publishers (like SAGE) and are indeed well-written. But &amp;hellip; there could be 100 reasons why a textbook should not cost that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the notion of ‘a textbook’ has evolved, at least for some disciplines. In many fields that are fast-evolving, textbooks written today will become dated in two years. Also, one textbook can rarely fulfill needs of a course, making it necessary to introduce fresh texts and multimedia content from the ‘open world’. Digital tools, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://h5p.org/&#34;&gt;H5P&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html&#34;&gt;Colaboratory&lt;/a&gt;, offer richer modalities, interoperability, and interactivity for learning in comparison with traditional paper books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More profoundly, &lt;strong&gt;the conceptualization of a textbook as a container of knowledge to be acquired by students is challenged by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newcultureoflearning.com/&#34;&gt;‘new cultures of learning’&lt;/a&gt; that de-emphasize ‘knowledge as stocks’ and value learning as &amp;lsquo;participating in a flow of knowledge production&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/strong&gt; Instructors can surely do inspiring things with a traditional textbook, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3221&#34;&gt;grounding principles of Open Educational Resources (OER)&lt;/a&gt; almost automatically make a philosophical statement that draws one’s teaching closer to new cultures of learning. It’s the (promised) paradigm shift behind OER (and open textbooks) that attracts me, besides cost concerns mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, by the way, these changes are not limited to textbooks, but also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/&#34;&gt;scholarly knowledge production in general&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-educational-practices&#34;&gt;Open educational practices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my thinking on OER are tilted towards &lt;a href=&#34;http://catherinecronin.net/research/openness-and-praxis/&#34;&gt;‘open educational practices’&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to making my course content open (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/meefen/la-spring16&#34;&gt;on Github for example&lt;/a&gt;), I am also interested in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open participation&lt;/strong&gt; — that does not limit participation within a socially, spatiotemporally, and technologically bounded environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student agency and voice&lt;/strong&gt; — that give students a say about what to learn and how to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connected learning&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.veletsianos.com/digital-scholarship-social-media-use-and-networked-participatory-scholarship/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;networked scholarship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; opportunities — that present a fuller picture of learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324611447_Designing_for_Networked_Collaborative_Discourse_An_UnLMS_Approach?_sg=PGJY4wgTJg5Cww01tBKT9c1Oo_ePJeI3nSHLFeyQAsJYUyWE6Dv8Ht-S2ofF60vy_b67vRe8oXJxu6xQB2SNhAYX7z7suxd3eW7PBIWm.En9a-PTggG7Kycn1iq4BewoyxPdNV69K57JZI_E-88MS-xc7YknPZ-7TE0_MzyhxrXSwZsC0Z8nUguDTKMBjTQ&#34;&gt;a design case I recently published in &lt;em&gt;TechTrends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, an EdTech journal, I introduce in great details about a course I designed with these ideas in mind. I wrote a course handbook, which is essentially a compilation of OER, and incorporated tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://hypothes.is/&#34;&gt;Hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; and Slack to facilitate collaborative discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be fun to integrate more ‘open pedagogy’ ideas in the next iteration of this course. Maybe asking students to rewrite the handbook. Maybe setting up open Jupyter Notebooks for students to fork, remix, and redistribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-this-mean-for-faculty-members&#34;&gt;What does this mean for faculty members?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;use their free time&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;on top of their day-to-day work, often only receiving relatively small grants as compensation&amp;quot; 🤔 Bit problematic framing of OER production, as if it&amp;#39;s done by amateurs, out of love.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ewout ter Haar (@ewout) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ewout/status/987005352402137088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good critique. Free-time is an unfamiliar word for many academics. The idea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://er.educause.edu/articles/2014/2/conjecture-tension-and-online-learning&#34;&gt;teaching online is already facing push-backs&lt;/a&gt; over the years. Structural supports for faculty members are needed to make OER production sustainable. Supporting broader acceptance of OER and open educational practices also requires cultural shifts within an institution, which is often hard to bring about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Gravel2017-yf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gravel, B. E., &amp;amp; Wilkerson, M. H. (2017). Integrating Computational Artifacts into the Multi-representational Toolkit of Physics Education. In D. F. Treagust, R. Duit, &amp;amp; H. E. Fischer (Eds.), Multiple Representations in Physics Education (pp. 47–70). Cham: Springer International Publishing. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-58914-5_3&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-58914-5_3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece presenting two case studies about computational artifacts in two communities &amp;ndash; one group of scientists, and one community of grade 5 students &amp;ndash; and their use of computational representation in their own work. Three major themes or discourse moves were identified from case studies of their discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool, SiMSAM, is focused more on representation instead of simulation, in my opinion. This is quite smartly done. Of course, one could argue simulation is covered by student explanations of their representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate more elaboration of the term &amp;lsquo;computational artifacts&amp;rsquo; because I noticed earlier literature would treat a computer as a computational artifacts as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computational artifacts such as simulations and visualizations are important repre- sentational tools in physics and physics education. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, computa - tional artifacts are constructed, used, and adapted over time by particular learning communities for particular purposes. Community members must negotiate how such artifacts should be understood as representations that can describe and uncover particular aspects of scientific phenomena. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we address the question: How does a learning community inte- grate a particular computational artifact into the shared multi-representational tool- kit they use for communicating and reasoning about scientific phenomena? (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, development of a shared understanding of the computational artifact involved (1) Working to articulate the representational meaning(s) of the artifact and its connection to other more familiar representations; (2) Using shared language about the artifact to focus attention on the causal mechanisms describing the phenomenon of interest; and (3) Noting limitations of the representational arti- fact and its computational architecture. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest this process is nontrivial, and critical for computational models to be deeply and meaningfully integrated into classroom-level scientific activity. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1.1 Computational Representations in Scientific Practice (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representational tools, thus, play a central role in the how knowledge is generated, expressed, and shared to construct the “lan- guage of communication” for the ideas relevant to that community (Noss et al. 2007, p. 381). The situation is no less true in science classrooms, where the growing use of multiple representations can fundamentally shape how learners interact with one another and co-construct knowledge (Jewitt et al. 2001; Prain and Waldrop 2010). All of this activity requires an understanding of how learners interpret, con- struct, and negotiate meaning across these various representational resources (Jewitt 2008). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most powerful and ubiquitous modes of representation in physics are computational (Thijssen 1999). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;exactly how computational artifacts are meant to serve as representations in science practice is unclear, and varies from community to com- munity (Grüne-Yanoff and Weirich 2010). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1.2 Computational Representations in Science Education (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stratford et al. ( 1998) documented what they called “Cognitive Strategies for Modeling”—analysis, relational reasoning, synthesis, testing and debugging, and making explanations—that they argue students engage in while building dynamic computational models. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, less work examines how such artifacts might afterward be used at the classroom level to support collec- tive argumentation and knowledge construction. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berland and Reiser ( 2011) found that some middle school students blurred the distinction between inferences and evidence when engaged in scientific argumentation using a computer simulation of ecosystem dynamics. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmelo-Silver et al. (2015) described how two teachers engaged their students differently in simulation-mediated inquiry. They found that one teacher, Mr. Fine, encouraged students to explicitly reason through what particular features of the simulation were meant to represent. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1.3 Computational Representations as Distributed (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are interested in studying communities in which members construct their own computational artifacts, and in the ways those artifacts then become understood, shared, and integrated into the representational toolkit of the commu- nity as a whole. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed representations are “&amp;hellip; created and used in the cooperative practices of persons as they engage with natural objects, manufactured devices, and traditions, as they seek to understand and solve new problems” (Osbeck and Nersessian 2006, p. 144). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;involving two notions they termed cognitive partnering and representational coupling. Cognitive partnering involves forming links across people and artifacts in order to allow or sustain sense-making practice. For example, researchers may note that they are building on colleagues’ prior ideas or work. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representational coupling involves articulat - ing relations across multiple representational resources, so that those resources form systems that can be used as models for reasoning. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a subset of members of a team create a computational artifact. The artifact is to be used meaningfully by the wider team, with the intention of moving forward the collective work. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;developing shared epistemic and representational practices to move forward students’ work (Enyedy 2005; Greeno and Hall 1997). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2 Research Design (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted as part of the NSF-funded project entitled SiMSAM: Bridging Student, Scientific, and Mathematical Models with Expressive Technologies (henceforth the SiMSAM Project; IIS-12172100). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did this by developing and researching how students use a simulation construction toolkit (henceforth SiMSAM for Simulation, Measurement, and Stop-Action Moviemaking; Wilkerson-Jerde et al. 2015), and by consulting with, and studying the behavior of, professional scientists who use computational modeling in their own work. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research design is most closely aligned with an interpretivist paradigm (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2.2 Professional Scientists: The LCD Research Group (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group sought to model the behavior of liquid crystal structures, which could in turn inform the development of faster and more energy-efficient liquid crystal displays. Their work involved extend- ing established 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional models of liquid crystal behavior to more complex, multi-dimensional cases. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We collected data during a meeting early in the collaboration. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2.3 5th Grade Science Class: The Evaporation and Condensation Lesson (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the activities, middle school students use computer- based animation and simulation tools to construct models of “experiential unseens” (Gravel et al. 2013, p. 165), such as smell diffusion or air pressure. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two–week activity was designed to focus on evaporation and condensation as related to the particulate nature of matter. For the first week, students addressed the question “When you take a cold bottle of soda out of the fridge, why does it get wet after some time?” and for the second, “What happens to puddles on a hot day?”. During both weeks, students were first invited to discuss their theories as a class and (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to create drawn models. Next, they worked in groups of 2–3 with SiMSAM and a desk-mounted camera to create stop-motion animations using common craft materi- als. Students could then crop images from their animations, which became pro- grammable entities. Finally, they used these entities to create computational simulations representing the processes of condensation or evaporation using a sim- ple, programming-by-demonstration and menu-based programming options (Fig. 3.2). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, it is students’ progress and ways of revising their generated models to become more coherent, explanatory, and predictive that are the focus of our work. (For a detailed account of the motivations for this sequence and ways in which learners iteratively present and revise ideas, see Wilkerson-Jerde et al. 2015.) (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2.4 Analysis (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guiding “quintain” (shared phenomenon of interest across instances; Stake 2006, p.4) was the uptake of a particular compu- tational artifact as a shared representational tool. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we analyzed the video segments as holistic single cases (Yin 2009), work- ing to understand each independently. We did this through a process of iterative, collaborative viewing (Jordan and Henderson 1995) during which we took notes and divided episodes into descriptive segments based on major themes. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this repeated viewing, we identified three distinct phases that constituted each case’s development of a shared representational understanding. For both groups, three descriptive segments or “phases” emerged in which participants were: (1) developing a shared understanding of the computational artifact as a rep- resentational tool; (2) leveraged the artifact to focus attention on their respective goals; and (3) discussed strengths and limitations of the computational environment relative to those goals. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3 Case 1: Modeling Liquid Crystal Displays (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3.1 Episode 1 – “It’s Just Gonna Lie Down?” (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fig. 3.3 Representational elements from Case 1, Episode 1. R1 shows the example that Ian first presents containing the particular parameters modeled and the 3D plots produced by the computa- tional scripts in Mathematica. This is the central computational artifact for this Episodes 1 and 2 of Case 1 (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;plots, generated by the script written in Mathematica, serve as the central computa- tional artifact for the discussion. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Ian’s initial description of Example 1, Peter re-articulates what he understood the plot to represent. He used a similar gesture to Ian’s (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this episode, Ian connected the computational model he was intro- ducing to a large collection of representational forms—including gesture, sketches, and 2D plots. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3.2 Episode 2 – “There’s Kind of a Funny Bump” (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team’s rapid navigation and critique of this new plot reflects their increasing comfort with the computationally-generated plots as representations of the behavior of liquid crystals–another example of Phase 2 (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.4 Case 2: Modeling Condensation and Cloud Formation (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second case study is drawn from the ninth day of the modeling activities done in one of Mr. Arbor’s 5th grade classrooms. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens to puddles on a hot day? (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simu - lation constructed by Sergio, Luis and Ryan was projected on a screen at the front of the room. The simulation featured puddles located at the bottom of the screen, small blue objects the group identified as “water droplets” positioned immediately above those puddles, and clouds at the top of the screen (Fig. 3.5A). The students programmed the simulation so that when run, the water particles moved upward in a somewhat random path toward the clouds. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.4.1 Episode 1: “What Do We Think About This Representation?” (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fig. 3.5 The student generated simulation projected on the Smartboard. In the simulation, “water droplet” objects positioned near puddle objects (A) move toward cloud objects. When a droplet intersects a cloud, it disappears and a new cloud appears near the site of intersection (B) (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short exchange, students begin to make connections between the compu- tational artifact—the SiMSAM simulation and its constituent symbols, behaviors, and interactions—and the phenomenon it is meant to represent. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2, and focus stu - dents’ attention on a key question about the phenomenon: “when there’s evaporation&amp;hellip; does it form its own new clouds, or does it add on to the clouds that are already here?” (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.4.2 Episode 2 – “Maybe You Could Have a Color Option” (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we redirected the conversation to see if there were other representational features or elements students wanted, but were unable to add to their simulations. This initiated Phase 3–an explicit conversation about the limita- tions of the modeling tool and whether it satisfactorily served the students’ repre- sentational goals. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than producing a second cloud when a water droplet collides with the exist- ing cloud, Kenny wanted to make clouds become darker in color. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LCD Research Group and 5th Grade Science Classroom we report on in this chapter are quite different learning communities. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to present these two in one chapter. We can think further about bridging them&amp;ndash;temporally or spatially. Like connecting students with scientists now; or thinking about those students 20 years later..  (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we draw comparisons between the processes and practices we found in the two cases, and identify specific discursive moves that marked ways in which members of each community begin to treat their respective computational artifacts as repre- sentational tools in service of their different goals. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.5.1 From Making Sense to Making Use of Computational Artifacts as Representations (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon further analysis, we found these different phases involved three types of discursive moves practiced by both the professionals and the students. These are described in Table 3.1. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta-representational talk refers to instances where participants established explicit links between elements of the computational artifacts and aspects of the phenomenon that they are working to understand. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also the means by which they developed a shared language around that artifact, such that it could then become a tool for thinking and an object of critique. We view critique as a meta-representational tool (diSessa and Sherin 2000) used to position the artifacts as a useful contribution, but also incom- plete, malleable, and fallible. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on these publicly-established and shared understandings and language, participants then focused their attention on more specific causal mechanisms related to the phenomenon under study. They began to articulate the mechanisms that (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 3.1 Discursive moves practiced as professionals and students worked to make sense and make use of computational artifacts as representations of physical phenomena (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;linked cause and effect, and questioned how these mechanisms were represented within and extended beyond the artifact itself. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they developed this understanding, they made suggestions for how to extend the architecture to accommodate their epistemic goals. The professionals recognized the need to extend or redevelop the numerical solvers needed to model liquid crystals (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.5.2 Understanding the Representational Toolkit of Physics and Physics Education (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computational tools are an integral part of the toolkit of physics and researchers are calling for increased integration of computational tools in physics education. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With both learning communities, the integration of these computational environ- ments into the toolkit of physics is deliberate, explicit, and effortful. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

Technology, Knowledge and Learning, 22(3), 385–400. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10758-017-9330-3&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10758-017-9330-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: Nice paper discussion the importance of engaging in transdisciplinary dialogues in learning analytics to expose philosophical assumptions we make. Many great points are made by making analogies with other transdisciplinary areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;: Two things improvable for this paper: 1) articulate transdisciplinarity in relation to multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity (since they are mentioned in the intro); and 2) be more critical of &amp;lsquo;inferences&amp;rsquo; as the main goal of learning analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on developments in cognate dis- ciplines, we analyse the inherent difficulties in inferring the complex phenomenon that is learning from big datasets. This forms the basis of a discussion about the possibilities for systematic collaboration across different paradigms and disciplinary backgrounds in interpreting big data for enhancing learning. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulties that have arisen in similar multidisciplinary fields dealing with big and complex datasets such as educational neuroscience (Palghat et al. 2017) highlight the critical necessity of monitoring and updating assumptions and conceptualisations that underpin the analysis and interpretation of big data. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define transdisciplinarity, as per Nicolescu (2002), as a strategy for recognising the importance of what exists between and beyond disciplinary boundaries and for embracing the multiple levels of reality for a more holistic approach to understanding learning and teaching. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Inferring Learning from Big Data (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the availability of big data sets have created some opportunities for researchers and instructors that were not previously viable, that is not to say that there has not already been a concerted effort to use, particularly, behavioural, demographic and other data to understand the learning process. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns related to sampling, generalisability, measurement error and power all speak to the underlying methodological and contextual factors that impact on learning and other psychological phenomena. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power inherent in these enormous sample sizes and potentially substantial numbers of variables across time, location and settings carry an additional conceptual problem that cannot only be solved by statistical methods alone. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data-driven inference, therefore, does not appear to be sufficient to provide a clear picture of psychological and social phenomena such as learning. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1 Learning: Process or Outcome, or Both? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Houwer et al. ( 2013) are critical of research examining learning, making the argument that it is often not even clear in research whether learning is being treated as a process or outcome. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While educationally, learning has been traditionally seen as a developmental process, in recent times, this idea has also been conflated with performance. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication of these trends is that there is an emphasis on a snapshot of performance as a means of determining student learning rather than seeing learning for what it is, a developmental process leading to an (ongoing) outcome. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This misguided focus on performance over learning therefore masks a deeper issue about what learning is. Jacobson et al. (2016) discuss a shift in the focus of educational research on learning towards more complex, systems-based conceptualisations. This change is an attempt to move the debate forward from the clear divide between cognitive and social/situated conceptions of learning. Their premise is that complex, systems-based models can incorporate both. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to model and make decisions based on binary outcome data like this has been most famously criticised as an example of the ‘McNamara fallacy’ (Basler 2009). This fallacy is named after a Vietnam War era US Secretary of Defence who over-relied on crude quantifications such as total numbers of casualties to determine progress in the war. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, learning is multidimensional, complex and requires the preparation of graduates for an unknowable future (Barnett 2004). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;implifying complex outcomes into relatively straightforward measures also risks invoking Campbell’s law (Nichols and Berliner 2007). This law is captured most concisely in the saying ‘teaching to the test’ that was applied to standardised national testing in primary and secondary education. In other words, simplified output measures become the goal of education rather than the earlier focus on teaching for quality learning. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Rowntree (1987) argues, inherent in both the McNamara fallacy and Campbell’s law are bias towards quantification that implies that anything that cannot be measured is not worthwhile. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures we currently have do not capture the complexities and multidimensional nature of learning, despite the nascent potential of large datasets. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps a truism to argue that learning, as a construct, ranges from repetition to higher order, complex phenomena, and must always be considered within the interplays of all historical, cultural, political, economic and social contexts that it occurs in. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2 Complex Phenomenon: Complex Model? (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacobson et al. ( 2016) argue that to continue to make progress in understanding and enhancing learning, it is indeed in complexity science that answers are to be found. A complex phenomenon requires a paradigm that has complexity at its core. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker ( 2016) pointed out that ITS remain ‘stupid’ in comparison to the people they are designed to assist. Instead, Baker argues that systems should be built to augment, rather than supplant human capabilities. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although modelling approaches used to infer learning from big datasets use a combi- nation of inductive and deductive logic, there is always, intrinsically, an inferential gap between human and machine. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether these sophisticated modelling approaches can seamlessly bridge the gap between data-driven inference and complex, messy reality is unclear. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversations and ongoing collaboration between the technical and theoretical communities will help to bridge the research and practice gap and lead to better inferences. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Inference and Translation of Big Data in Practice (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the replication crisis, these will inevitably link to fundamental issues of rigour and validity due to the diversity of approaches different researchers bring to the field based on their academic and contextual backgrounds. Learning analytics, as a developing field, may not be well prepared to address these changes due to the emphasis to date on the practical aspects of learning analytics implementation, as has often been the case in similar interdisciplinary projects. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not about &amp;lsquo;not be well prepared&amp;rsquo;. instead, LA is not facing the same issue, or crisis, as psychology studies. we should focus on practical value and integrity instead of validity as such. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learning analytics as an educational science field (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not sure about this.  (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics is a transdisciplinary area of research by default, as it is grounded in transdisciplinary educational practices (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;distinguish trans-, inter-, and multi-. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learning analytics is not impervious to considerations of design rigour and relevance to facilitate causal inferences. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, critical reflection in using big data in higher education practice contexts becomes even more necessary. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics is conceptualised as a sense- making and actionable science in practice (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While critical discussions of translational issues in inferences made from big data have emerged (Reimann 2016; Wise and Shaffer 2015), learning analytics as a practice- focussed field could further benefit from the lessons learnt in the health and clinical sciences, which have been able to achieve a significant level of transdisciplinarity. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a genuinely transdisciplinary research and practice field such as learning analytics, two-way communication between researchers and practitioners is crucial to advance empirical and theoretical development in complex, collaborative research and practice contexts. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another implication of inferential challenges for the use of big data in higher education is towards actionable science. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one thing is to say LA is transdisciplinary field, another thing is to constantly draw back to &amp;lsquo;inferences&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;science&amp;rsquo; as the central concerns of this field. seems contradictory. just a footnote. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, in driving action, data is sometimes viewed as evidence in and of itself and thus may be perceived as sufficient in justifying directions for actions. This illusion of objectivity of data or analytics is a cognitive fallacy (Berger and Berry 1988), and can result in a false sense of rigour (Dover and Schultz 2016) and potential misap- plication of sense-making and actions (Cohen 1994). This perception of data as unques- tionably objective has been shown to be problematic in other domains. For example, the claimed objectivity of big data mining in drug safety has been demonstrated to be a barrier to effective pharmacological clinical judgement. Outcomes from different software sys- tems and vendor tools were deemed to be discrepant simply through differential data transformation and computation methods (Hauben et al. 2007). This result, therefore, prompted the critical role of collaborative communication between the technical and functional subdomains, facilitating more realistic perceptions of the data. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the role of relative subjectivity and complexity in making inferences could not only open the way for more accurate and appropriate judgement and decision making but also recognises the realities of the complexities of measurement and meaning making. Thus, understandably, the focus on issues about ethics in using learning analytics is prevalent in affecting educational practice (e.g., Ferguson et al. 2016; Prinsloo and Slade 2016). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practitioners have the added responsibility of critically considering the consequences of their actions beyond intended improvements in learning, teaching, or retention, to that of impact on individuals and groups, as well as the emergent ecological consequences. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 A Transdisciplinary Approach to Interpreting Big Data (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful consideration of disciplinary differences in ontology and epistemology has also been problematic in other cognate fields such as educational neuroscience. However, a concerted effort to bridge the laboratory and the classroom (see Horvath et al. 2017) is beginning to move educational neuroscience towards a transdisciplinary research agenda. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One difficulty in working across disciplines that is evident for example in educational neuroscience is that there are multiple layers of interpretation and analysis of learning from small parts of the brain over minute timeframes to the whole student over a lifetime (see Horvath and Lodge 2017). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By framing levels of analysis and action into abridged con- ceptual models, a possible way forward towards bridging these layers can be proposed. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to make explicit the assumptions underpinning the inferences being made about learning on the basis of the data. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a finding from a neuroimaging study can have impact on teaching practice in the classroom if it is adequately interpreted at the level of the brain and mind, through the behavioural level and again reinterpreted for teaching practice. Such a research agenda involves neuroscientists, cognitive psychologists, educational psychologists and teachers all working together across levels of data collection and interpretation. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is possible to extend on these previous models and come up with a version for situating big data analysis in the context of higher education research. Such a hierarchy is presented in Fig. 3. Again, this depiction highlights the need to make meaning of data collected through research conducted at each level for the other levels. The aim is pre- sented here as having an impact on students as individuals as they exist in the world. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim here is simply to suggest a possible linear translation and analysis approach for research on learning and how it can help interpretation of big datasets. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translation of this sort means that the inferences being made about the patterns evident in large real-life datasets are grounded in empirical evidence from laboratory studies. Therefore, any inferential gaps emerging from the interpretation of big data alone can be explicitly tested under controlled conditions. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the words translation and inferences worry me. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach would involve a meta-model of learning where many inferences are made and triangulated. This model has been advocated in the emerging field of psychoinfor- matics (Yarkoni 2012). A feature of this approach is that, rather than treating different forms of information as hierarchical in time and space, all indicators and conceptualisa- tions are treated as broadly equal and indicative of the central and holistic meta-construct. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have alluded to in thus far, the key here is that all members of a transdis- ciplinary project discuss and make explicit their conceptual resources: that is, their definition of learning, where they see learning occurring and the methods by which they infer learning from the outset. A hierarchical model belies an assumption that some forms of evidence are more rigorous or relevant than others. While this may be true to an extent, it does not help resolve fundamental differences in the approach that researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to make sense of data. Our ecological model is not designed to be an exact representation of reality, however, it does provide a way of (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thinking about evidence that moves beyond a notion that some forms of evidence are superior to others. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a systematic way of fostering these conversations both builds on and generates the affordances of multiple pathways for understanding learning. We are therefore in agreement with Nathan and Alibali (2010) that any endeavour broadly char- acterised as the learning sciences should involve complementary systematic and elemental aspects (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 Conclusion (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the learning sciences, there is continuing debate about what learning is and how best to infer it. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of our task means that more efficient ways of coming together and facilitation that moves the conversation forward are needed. This initiative includes, and indeed is premised on, being mindful of the episte- mological and ontological realities of collaborators, researchers and practitioners in the field. While each may not all see learning in the same way, and try to infer learning using different methodologies, we have attempted in this paper to provide necessary ground to move the transdisciplinary conversation forward and provide a basis for a multidimen- sional research agenda including deliberate sense-making and translation across levels of inference. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on August 7, 2016 when &lt;a href=&#34;http://learning-analytics.info/journals/index.php/JLA/announcement/view/119&#34;&gt;the call for papers of our &lt;em&gt;Special Section on Temporal Analyses of Learning Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was posted on the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Learning analytics&lt;/em&gt; (JLA) website. It was even earlier &amp;ndash; probably around late 2014 &amp;ndash; when Alyssa Wise, Simon Knight, Britte Cheng and I teamed up for the temporality workshop series at the &lt;em&gt;Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK)&lt;/em&gt; conference. At that time, I was still in Toronto, Alyssa in Vancouver, Simon in the UK, and Britte at SRI. This April, 3.5 years after conceiving the temporality workshop series, &lt;a href=&#34;http://learning-analytics.info/journals/index.php/JLA/issue/view/427/showToc&#34;&gt;the second part of the &lt;em&gt;Special Section on Temporal Analyses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has finally come out in JLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can read in &lt;a href=&#34;http://learning-analytics.info/journals/index.php/JLA/article/view/5940&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;our JLA editorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we try to draw the community&amp;rsquo;s attention to four critical questions for &lt;em&gt;temporal analysis&lt;/em&gt; (typically by researchers) and &lt;em&gt;temporal analytics&lt;/em&gt; (that move from research towards practical ends):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/article_images/critical-questions.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One brief, yet important, section of this editorial reflects on &lt;strong&gt;the influence of &lt;em&gt;measured time&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;experienced time&lt;/em&gt; in education&lt;/strong&gt;. In the editorial, we did not have the luxury &amp;ndash; in terms of both time and space &amp;ndash; of exploring this issue as deep as we could. In this blog post, I hope to expand on this important issue from multiple angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-understanding-of-time-is-never-settled&#34;&gt;Our understanding of time is never settled&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; is discussed, and quite often disputed, in philosophical texts. Deep reflection on time dates back to thousands of years in different philosophical traditions (e.g., Greek, Indian, Chinese philosophies). Many key questions remain debated nowadays. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is time real?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does time have a beginning or an end?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does time progress linearly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there parallel timelines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which can be considered &amp;lsquo;primitive&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; instant &lt;em&gt;time points&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;time durations&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are time and space related?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do human beings sense time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list of questions can keep going. One sure thing is: &lt;strong&gt;Our understanding of time&lt;/strong&gt;, reflected in philosophical thinking of all kinds, &lt;strong&gt;is &lt;a href=&#34;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/&#34;&gt;very much unsettled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; ontologically, epistemologically, and psychologically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Narrowing down to the debate on *time points* and *time durations* for instance, ... --&gt;

&lt;!-- Take human perception of time, for example, great complexity has been uncovered in cognitive, sensory, physical, biophysical, and neural aspects (Pöppel 2004). For example, a time period shorter than 40 milliseconds is perceived as a &#39;time point&#39;, whereas one&#39;s subjective present lasts for approximately 2 to 3 seconds. --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-relation-to-time-is-often-implicitly-assumed&#34;&gt;Our relation to time is often implicitly assumed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the individual level, how we conceive and relate ourselves to time is very important but rarely articulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; related to our perception, memory, decision-making, or action?
&lt;!-- - Is one&#39;s *time* a resource? --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are one&amp;rsquo;s actions coordinated in relation to time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; an action to achieve a goal? How to time an action in relation to other actions to achieve a goal? How to time an action in relation to other actions by other agents (people, machine, etc.) to achieve a goal?
&lt;!-- - Or do we simply think time as time, nothing more and nothing less? --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rarely engage with these types of questions as individuals. Our relation with time is usually maintained at the &lt;em&gt;first-order&lt;/em&gt; at best; that is, we think about or plan our use of time or the timing of personal actions within a social context. &lt;strong&gt;Yet we rarely reflect on the &lt;em&gt;second-order&lt;/em&gt; relation with time; that is how our relation with time &amp;ndash; both perceived and enacted &amp;ndash; is impacting us as individuals and a society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the societal level, looking back into the human history, it is apparent that as societies evolve, our relation with time has gone through dramatic changes. Our lived experiences are fundamentally shaped by our conception of time (and space). In ancient times a hallmark of an advanced civilization is the precision of its calendar because it would inform crucial societal activities such as farming and hunting. Farmers consult calendars to decide when to plant seeds, while hunters would adjust their group activities based on animal birth rates, migration, and so forth. Our ancestors understood and internalized rhythms of the nature and also constructed ones in order to coordinate complex social activities. The societies and cultures we grow up with and live in greatly shaped our relation with time, which in turn shape how our societies operate. Our relation with time gets built in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170502112607.htm&#34;&gt;languages we speak, which in turn shape how we perceive time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &amp;ldquo;clock time&amp;rdquo; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/time/mechanical_time.aspx&#34;&gt;mechanical time&lt;/a&gt; became established as a standard and spread around the globe, our relation with time became increasingly finely defined. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/railroads-create-the-first-time-zones&#34;&gt;The time zone system came to exist because of steam engines&lt;/a&gt;, and now it&amp;rsquo;s dictating all sorts of human communication. The reordering of space and time was/is an undercurrent of colonization, modernization, and globalization (Edwards &amp;amp; Usher, 2000). Now time slots on our personal calendars have become inter-connected, and the ways in which we could coordinate our time at various levels are more sophisticated than ever. As a result, any in-depth temporal analysis of human activities requires a deep look at our second-order relation with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- More recently, globalization has resulted in a compression of time (and space) (Edwards &amp; Usher, 200X).

&gt; Central to globalisation is...  (p. 27) --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;temporal-considerations-are-built-into-technological-environments&#34;&gt;Temporal considerations are built into technological environments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given human activities are increasingly mediated by computer-based environments, it is also key to recognize assumed theories of time built into computer systems, as well as what data they capture and how they are captured in relation to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From temporal reasoning perspectives, for instance, artificial intelligence (AI) scholars Knight and Ma (1993) have worked on various ways of representing time in temporal systems decades ago. They explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common theoretical basis is the standard time-point system assumed by classical physics. In this theory, the time domain consists of a continuum of time points, isomorphic to  the real line. Time intervals are taken as intervals on the real line, and duration of intervals is the real number difference of their start and end points. However, for many applications, particularly those in artificial intelligence and natural language understanding, the time-point system is not ideal for either the expression of temporal facts, or for the storage and organisation of incomplete temporal knowledge. (p. 401)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the learning analytics community, and the broader ecosystem it operates within (which includes important information system standards such as xAPI), &lt;strong&gt;we often take &lt;em&gt;the standard time-point system&lt;/em&gt; for granted&lt;/strong&gt;. We accordingly engineer computer systems to tag learning actions by timestamps, which then get used for temporal analysis and reasoning. However, we need to be aware of a myriad of inferences we make from those timestamps to our claims of learning phenomena. Take MOOC learning for example, we often assume within a single login session, the amount of time (duration) a learner spends on a specific course page is determined by two adjacent timestamps. While we can reasonably argue this inferred measure is good enough, &lt;strong&gt;we as a community should be aware of temporal considerations as such built into learning systems and data&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as their implications for temporal analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ## Time and Artificial intelligence

Finally, existing temporal analysis techniques were built with specific analytical goals related to temporality. @Reimann2009-pm distinguishes two important categories: time---as related to questions such as when an event take place, how long it lasts, and how a state change over time; and order---focused on temporal organization of events. A variety of temporal analysis techniques, as we see in this Special Section, are designed with an emphasis on one over the other. Sometimes it could beneficial to experiment with multiple techniques for converging or complementary findings (Chen et al. 2017). In some other cases, like studies included in the Special Section, we should take the liberty to propose new temporal measures and techniques. In addition to the time vs. order distinction, we should clearly delineate the boundary between temporality and causation in temporal analysis, as they are too often mixed with each other [REF]. This is particularly important when temporal analysis is applied in practice to make impactful changes. We need to avoid making deterministic and prescriptive claims (in Fatalistic terms) based on temporal observations even though how causation can be drawn from temporal observations remains debated [REF]. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ## Time, learning, and impact

Learning is fundamentally about change, which takes time. (Of course, philosophers like [John McTaggart](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mctaggart/) would also agree change is essential to time as well.) In the JLA editorial, we pointed out that learning theories have explicit and implicit assumptions and considerations of how changes take place over time. In other words, learning theories are grounded in assumed theories of time. These theories of learning would inform analytical choices made in temporal analysis---choices such as whether to focus on time-points or durations, changes over time or temporal organizations, timescales, reference points, and the relationship between temporal analysis and other analytical angles.

In addition to inspecting temporal assumptions embedded in learning theories, we also need to look at Given learning if often contextualized in an education regime and mediated by computer technologies,

-   Given time constraints placed by education regimes, the concern is to incur satisfactory “positive” changes in learners within a certain period of time. [How about no-change? Is it okay to stay unchanged?]

This speaks to, for instance, the context of MOOC and the notion of international classrooms (edX report) that have indeed blabla.

Education in particular has strict temporal boundaries that would dictate daily educational practice. Yet they are also usually implicitly assumed, just like our general relations to time at the individual and societal level.  Since the industrial age, we started to place learners into grade schools based on their age. Like other institutions, we slice up a calendar year into semesters or quarters, and divide a day into sessions for varied educational activities. In one class session, detailed planning is often championed and a “model” teacher may crush a session into minutes to demonstrate one’s dedication to education. In computer-supported learning environments, we implement sophisticated mechanisms to record timestamped learner activities; we build dashboards to present temporal graphs related to one’s progress in a domain. It seems in education we are also moving towards finer planning, monitoring, and controlling over our relation with time. Learning analytics as a field offers rich, exciting opportunities in this area. --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-forward&#34;&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is an urgent need to (re)consider and reunite time and space in educational systems.&lt;/strong&gt; While many educational theories are fundamentally about time (e.g., Piaget&amp;rsquo;s stages of cognitive development), there is increasing recognition of learning that happens in different spaces, places, and socio-cultural-political contexts.  Just like the reordering of time and space in modernization and globalization, the reordering of time and space has crucial implications for learning in our postmodern, postcolonial world. When building &amp;ldquo;powerful&amp;rdquo; tools like MOOCs and predictive analytics, we are inheriting &amp;ndash; often unknowingly &amp;ndash; older spatiotemporal structures that would dictate educational experiences of many. And of course, we&amp;rsquo;re also creating new structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving forward, one important exercise we could do is to reveal dominant views of time and space in our work at hand and ask some bizarre questions.&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; Maybe asking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we making arrogant temporal assumptions about learners?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might the adopted temporal structure in our MOOC impact a learner from a different culture or speaking a different language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is an analytics tool we build based on temporal analysis fair?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is a tool impacting the temporal aspect of learning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these questions are tough to answer. And we cannot expect algorithms or AI to address such questions. What questions do you have?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Episodes from my trip in China</title>

&lt;p&gt;I am not an ethnographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there were a few episodes from my trip to/in China last month that caught my attention, or &amp;lsquo;gaze&amp;rsquo;. To put these episodes into perspective, my most recent trip to China took place &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodong.ch/blog/2016-11-03-trip-to-asia/&#34;&gt;in October 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-the-escalator&#34;&gt;On the Escalator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more subways are built underground, I encountered more of those super long escalators in mega cities. On one escalator in Shanghai, I heard its accompanying &amp;lsquo;voice reminder system&amp;rsquo; saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please hold the handrail firmly and attend to your steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not lean on the handrail. &lt;strong&gt;Do not look at your phone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last sentence of the voice system was new. The intimate connection between us with screens has been built into another piece of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sns-img.b0.upaiyun.com/dunzd/1710/2621/53/151240667855781509026035.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cdsb.com/Public/cdsb_offical/2017-10-26/148418749157279040888484000860608264626.html&#34;&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;say-something-in-english&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Say Something in English&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a workday, my pre-schooler son and I were playing in a playground in Shanghai. There were a bunch of other kids &amp;ndash; mostly younger &amp;ndash; also playing there. My son always prefers talking with me in Mandarin but may entertain with a few English words from time to time. Then there was a dad with his young daughter (approximately 2 years old). It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for him to make a request to his daughter: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Baby, can you say something in English?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;  The same thing happened again the next day in a park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later when I was in my hometown, a small town in Western China, I visited a newly built factory where an uncle works. This factory manufactures food supplements with nutritions extracted from traditional Chinese herbs. I somehow ended up meeting with their young sales team, which was made of four fresh college graduates. They were in their early 20s, and two of them graduated from the same high school I attended. Then I began to learn about their goals of taking over their international sales from intermediaries located in costal areas. They were not confident in their English capabilities though and showed tremendous interests in Western culture(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest dream while growing up in my hometown was to go to college in Shanghai or Beijing. Now it seems people living in my hometown are aspiring to ride the tide of globalization. It may be still difficult to attract or retain necessary talents. But they have lofty goals. The new factory aims to become a listed company in 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/article_images/shanghai_yuechi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-accept-both-wechat-and-zhifubao&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I accept both WeChat and Zhifubao&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riding on a taxi from Shanghai Pudong Airport to a hotel, I noticed two QR codes attached to the dashboard of the taxi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I accept both WeChat and Zhifubao,&amp;rdquo; said the driver when we arrived. And he taught me how to use them on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, I could basically &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2110118/going-cash-free-why-china-light-years-ahead&#34;&gt;go cash-free everywhere in China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/09/11/1b7d1df6-8ef9-11e7-9f40-4d9615941c08_1320x770_114008.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-still-don-t-see-the-point&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I still don&amp;rsquo;t see the point.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my stay at Beijing Normal, I taught a few classes on topics such as MOOCs and learning analytics. In a graduate-level class, a professor introduced to us a project aiming to build a recommender engine to help highschool students choose subjects in &lt;a href=&#34;http://gaokao.eol.cn/news/201710/t20171027_1562295.shtml&#34;&gt;the newly reformed college entrance exam&lt;/a&gt;. The recommender engine will be based on a wide range of factors, including previous performance, personality traits, competitiveness of the student&amp;rsquo;s aspired college, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One student said, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;I still don&amp;rsquo;t see the point.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; Her argument was this choice is too high-stake and too personal. She would like to make the choice on her own even if the recommendation is meant to be informational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had a point. A very good one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>天宝趣谈</title>

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;按：这是我受邀为天宝小学写的一篇文章。人生头13年在天宝乡度过。现如今，因为乡镇合并，它已经从地图上消失。好在记忆还一直存留。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/article_images/tianbao.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我是一个从天宝走出的孩子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在人生的头13年里，我很少走出天宝，有关我的一切，都在这里。因为父母在天宝小学教书，从一出生我就和天宝小学联系在了一起。从四岁入学到初中毕业，我在天宝小学度过了九年时光。离开后的十几年，从岳池到北京、再到加拿大和美国，我离这片故土渐行渐远，却永远走不出她的羁绊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小学的头五年，我在石狮子村小就读。父亲是我的启蒙老师，至今印象很深的是每天和他从家到学校的&amp;rdquo;艰辛跋涉&amp;rdquo;。跋涉中我经历了夏天的暴雨、秋天的稻子、冬天结冰的水田、春天的莺飞草长。在这条弯弯曲曲的小路上，有我对每个时令的特殊记忆。几年里，我已熟知每块石板，每块青苔，每个泥坑，每片竹林。而我那时最童真的幻想就是能沿这条小路，搭起一片遮天蔽日的葡萄架，一边帮我躲避夏日炎炎，一边奉上葡萄的甘甜。五年间，这条葡萄长廊终究没能搭起来，摸爬滚打中我的双膝却留下了许多伤疤。在这条小路上，我沐浴在天宝温润丰富的四季里，从幼稚的孩童成为坚毅的少年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在村小的这五年，我们换了多次教室。最初的泥胚房里，只有讲台后方的一扇小窗。阴雨天里，两盏昏暗的白炽灯似乎在努力往我们书本上撒满光亮，却终究力不从心。后来用几条竹竿挂起了三排电灯，书本上的字才终于能看清。因为翻修校舍，我们的教室好几次被搬到附近的村落。并不宽大的民宅里，竖起黑板便成为我们的教室。我们失去了熟悉的操场，但从来没少半点乐趣。我们在泥泞的地坝上滚着铁环，在教室的墙角里挤起&amp;rdquo;油糟&amp;rdquo;。我们从未抱怨过学习条件，一个20多人的班级，在一起度过几年时光就是最大的恩赐。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小学六年级时，因为父亲工作调动我和他一起到了乡小。更严格的班级管理似乎让我失去了更多的自由。因为离家更远，刚开始的几天我总是迟到，最后决定住校。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;和父亲住进了学校一角的一个教师宿舍后。我逐渐结实了一批玩伴，校园生活又多了许多新乐趣。十岁出头的男孩总是无聊，脑子里总是有各种怪主意。比如去附近的山坡上探险、比如把桔子放到电炉里煮、比如结队去偏远的学校厕所里讲鬼故事把自己吓得半死。那时的我痴迷于乒乓球，却不太明白为何课后还要看书。放学后的夜里，我们在校园里闲逛，从未探讨过天宝地理位置之所在，却大谈着各自遥远的梦想。而那无数梦想之中，最大的无外乎是上大学。除此之外，似乎想象不到更远大的理想了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初三的毕业季里，似乎总是在下雨。我们的教室在当时新校舍三楼拐角的位置，下起雨来风灌满整个教室。我们开始忙于应付各种模拟考试、会考、和中考。记得会考后根据成绩只有一部分同学能参加中考，竞争升入重点中学的机会。迎战中考的教室里，剩下为数不多的同学，繁忙备考中又多了一份忧伤。而那些空座位上的同学，大多我再也没能见过。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;时光流转，我也渐渐明白人生就是偶然、幸运和遗憾编织的画卷。1999年夏天，我从天宝小学毕业去了岳池一中读高中。三年后我从繁忙的县城中学毕业，去了更繁忙的北京上大学。北师大本科毕业后保送去了北大读硕士，再申请奖学金到了加拿大多伦多大学攻读博士学位。博士毕业后，2015年我顺利成为了明尼苏达大学的助理教授，至今仍是系里最年轻、唯一来自中国的教授。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一笔带过的这十几年间，我无数次地回想在天宝小学的时光。大一时，我一次在寝室奋笔疾书写下了一篇关于对天宝的记忆。或许因思成疾，写完发现自己发着高烧，去校医院打针。后来到了异国他乡，埋头苦读中偶然抬头，眼中映入异国他乡的大楼，心中却常忆起天宝多彩的四季和简洁的生活。我时常回想起孩童时听来的一句话：&amp;rdquo;天宝，天然的一块宝地&amp;rdquo;；会想起老师训导我们时提到的天宝小学&amp;rdquo;三宝&amp;rdquo;：雨伞、筒靴、手电筒；还会想起童年里做过的一个梦，梦见自己翻过一直横亘在天边的那座山，看到了山那边的世界。那时的我，深沉地爱着这片土地，又多么想离开她，去看看山那边的世界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;后来，我翻过了那座山，攀上了泰山，飞越了太平洋、大西洋。曾经最大梦想是上大学的我，现在在一所全球知名大学里任教，教着来自世界各地的学生。而今，在天宝和天宝小学的时光，成了永远珍藏的记忆，激励我继续前行。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>火车</title>

        &lt;p&gt;上次在中国坐硬座火车可能需要追溯到十年前。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;还记得大一寒假回家，学校给我们订到了最慢的“绿皮车”。从北京到四川老家，摇摇晃晃坐了40多个小时，感觉像坐到了地老天荒。后来的7年里，再也没坐上绿皮车，但当时最快的特快车到四川也要24小时。学生穷，不舍得买卧铺，每次都坐硬座。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;现在想来，每年寒暑假的往返列车上也有不少有趣的记忆。大一坐绿皮车的那次，和隔壁寝室电子系几位重庆的同学一起。40小时里我们聊的天，或许比整个大学四年都多。睡梦中突然醒来，火车又停了，窗外是白雪皑皑的大山，自己不知身在何处，似乎从刚才的梦境进入了另一个梦境。后来一次寒假在北京-&amp;gt;成都的特快车上，打了一场人生至今最过瘾、惊心动魄的双升。车票号码神奇地把我们安排到一起，在密闭拥挤的空间里相处一整天，一起煎熬，不问姓名，然后各奔东西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在同一个车厢里的还有只买到站票的农民工朋友。他们托着编织袋和塑料桶，偶尔相互传递一瓶浓烈的白酒，用手机大声放着新进流行的歌曲。在特殊的季节里，学生和农民工这两个平时交集不大的群体聚集在这个车厢，相互照顾地交替着坐，分享着归家的急切和漫漫长路的煎熬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这次回国，我又有机会坐了一次长途火车。其中最长的一次旅行是从成都到郑州的高铁。以前大半天的旅程，高铁在6小时内就能完成。车厢里每个人都有位置，没有了站票。双向的座位也变成了单向。车厢整洁、舒适、安静。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但在这趟快速列车上，向前我只能看到前排人的头顶，再也不会经历那么多和陌生人的谈话，再也找不到当年“同车共济”的情怀。这些，被文明、国际化、高速度一并埋葬掉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但对于快4岁的儿子来说，这会是他对火车的第一次记忆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Suthers2015-vf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suthers, D. (2015). From contingencies to network-level phenomena: multilevel analysis of activity and actors in heterogeneous networked learning environments. In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Learning Analytics And Knowledge (pp. 368–377). ACM. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1145/2723576.2723626&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1145/2723576.2723626&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: Introduces the Traces framework coming out of Suthers&amp;rsquo; years of work in CSCL and learning analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: This paper and the Traces framework are super relevant to my current thinking on multidimensional network analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vary in the agent of learning (e.g., individual, small group, network or community), and in the process of learning &lt;a href=&#34;e.g., information transfer or knowledge communication [6], intersubjective meaning-making such as argumentation and co-construction [2, 33], shifts in participation and identity [17, 27], and accretion of cultural capital [30]&#34;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the paper is twofold: to summarize the current version of this framework, called Traces, and to illustrate its relevance to practitioners via an envisioned “activity reporter”. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these environments, learning is distributed across time and virtual place (media), and learners may participate in multiple settings. We focus on networked learning environments (NLE)2, which we define to include any socio-technical network that involves (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework is motivated by a view of learning as a complex and multilevel phenomenon. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mediated interaction between participants (hence “networked”) in which learning might take plac (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three kinds of graphs model interaction: Contingency graphs record how events such as chatting or posting a message are observably related to prior events by temporal and spatial proximity and by content. Uptake graphs aggregate the multiple contingencies between each pair of events to model how each given act may be “taking up” prior acts. Session graphs are abstractions of uptake graphs: they cluster events into spatio- temporal sessions with uptake relationships between sessions. Relationships between actors and artifacts are abstracted from interaction graphs to obtain associograms [38, 40], which can be folded into traditional sociograms. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traces Analytic Framework (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the theory [15, 34] and analytic representations [37, 40] behind this work. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The representations used at various levels of analysis are shown schematically in Figure 1 (next page): micro- relations between situated acts by participants are identified and then aggregated into interactional relations, and further aggregated into network level phenomena. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are parsed using methods that are necessarily system-specific into an event stream, shown in the second level (boxes in Figure 1b). The event representation includes their time, location, event type, actor, and content or media object where relevant. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Contingency Graph (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this level of abstraction (Figure 1b), we compute contingencies between events, to produce a model of how acts are mutually contextualized (shown as arrows). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A contingency called proximal event (PE) reflects the likelihood that events occurring close together in time and space are related. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting contingency graph (e.g., Figure 1b) is represented as the first layer of abstraction in what we call an Entity-Event- Contingency graph or EEC [37]. In the EEC graph, vertices are Events. These can be of various types (e.g., enter chat, exit chat, chat contribution), and are annotated with time stamps, actors, content (e.g., chat content), and locations (e.g., chat rooms) involved in the event. Contingencies are typed edges between vertices (the types were described in the previous paragraph), and there may be multiple edges between any two vertices (e.g., two proximal events by the same actor with lexical overlap will have at least three contingencies between them). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Address (ADR) and reply (RPL) contingencies are installed between an utterance mentioning a user by name and the last contribution (ADR) and next contribution (RPL) by that participant within a time window, using a parser/matcher of user IDs to first names. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2 Uptake Graph (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same actor contingencies (SA) are installed to prior acts of a participant over a larger time window to reflect the continuity of an agent’s purpose. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to collapse the multiple edges between vertices into single edges for two reasons. First, most graph algorithms assume that there is at most only one edge between two vertices. Second, we are interested in uptake, the relationship between events in which a human action takes up some aspects of prior events as being significant in some manner [37]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overlap in content as represented by sets of lexical stems is used to produce a lexical contingency (LEX) weighted by the number of overlapping stems. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 1c, uptake graphs are similar to contingency graphs in that they also relate events, but they collect together bundles of the various types of contingencies between a given pair of vertices into a single graph edge, weighted by a combination of the strength of evidence in the contingencies and optionally filtering out low-weighted bundles. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3 Sessions (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clusters of events in spatio-temporal proximity are computed to identify “ sessions” (indicated by rounded containers in Figure 1c). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For inter-session analysis, we collapse each session into a single vertex representing the session, but retain the inter-session uptake links. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.5 Summary and Implementation (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our framework provides multiple pathways for analysis. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For intra-session analysis, the uptake graph for a session is isolated. Several paths are possible from here. For example, the sequential structure of the interaction can be micro-analyzed to understand the development of group accomplishments: this part is not automated. Methods for graph structure analysis can be applied, such as cluster detection, analysis of graph motifs [20] that represent uptake patterns of interest, or tracing out thematic threads [41]. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.4 Sociograms (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either within or across sessions, we can fold uptake graphs into actor-actor sociograms (directed weighted graphs, Figure 1d). The tie strength between actors is the sum of the strength of uptake between their contributions. These sociograms can be analyzed using conventional social network analysis methods such as degree or eigenvector centrality to identify key actors, etc. [22, 42]. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another line of analysis not discussed in this paper is to fold events into actor-artifact networks, or bipartite weighted directed graphs that we call “associograms” for short, because they capture how actors are associated with each other via mutual read and write of media objects. In that line of work, we have undertaken community analysis of associograms to detect not only human participants in communities, but also the artifacts that reflect their mediated nature (e.g., synchronous or asynchronous) [38]. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Periodic Activity/Actor Reports (p. 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1.2 How are the sessions related? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.4 How coherent are the sessions? (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, “coherence” simply means continuity of uptake: it is not a value judgment on the quality of interaction, as there may have been several distinct yet high quality conversations in a space- time region. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future Work (p. 9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present implementation is research software, written to explore the range of analytic functionality enabled by the Traces framework. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework could be re-implemented to use current technologies and APIs. For example, the data import layer could utilize the TinCan API (tincanapi.com), which would make our framework applicable to a variety of platforms adhering to this standard and make it easier to write importers for other platforms in a less ad-hoc manner. We might replace our custom Hibernate graph persistence engine with Neo4j (neo4j.com), which has matured since we started this project. An analytic workbench such as [14] would increase usability for researchers. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Web Annotation of Research Articles in Learning Sciences</title>
      <link>/blog/2017-12-08-jls-web-annotation/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;As a member of the Outreach Advisory Board of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/hlns20&#34;&gt;Journal of the Learning Sciences (JLS)&lt;/a&gt;, I was really glad to see the journal putting together a web annotation event during December 11-22, 2017. This activity is yet another move made by the editorial team to engage its readership on various social media venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Coming Soon: Web annotation of JLS articles in Hypothes.is.&lt;br&gt;The first article is a study by Akkerman and Bruining published in 2016 in Volume 25 (2).Read the full article at &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/tGoOiQKLUR&#34;&gt;https://t.co/tGoOiQKLUR&lt;/a&gt;  and visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/2dYOBe15L8&#34;&gt;https://t.co/2dYOBe15L8&lt;/a&gt;  for instructions for using &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hypothes_is?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@hypothes_is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/z5oSHleIKB&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/z5oSHleIKB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; JrnlLearningSciences (@JLearnSciences) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JLearnSciences/status/937719563390672896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;December 4, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this web annotation event, participants are invited to annotate a recently published open-access article, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1147448&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multilevel Boundary Crossing in a Professional Development School Partnership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, using an open web annotation tool named &lt;a href=&#34;https://hypothes.is/&#34;&gt;Hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt;. Hats off to the authors for their support of this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The editorial team has put together &lt;strong&gt;detailed instructions&lt;/strong&gt; in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cmoz22xEY8QjHBiYC-H2oU0YHJSTLCBhWelbusSXbKM/edit#slide=id.g2b48df0836_0_10&#34;&gt;Google presentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During and after the event, in addition to the Hypothes.is sidebar, a participant can either use &lt;a href=&#34;https://hypothes.is/search?q=url%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.tandfonline.com%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F10508406.2016.1147448&#34;&gt;Hypothes.is&amp;rsquo; advanced search functionality&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html?facet=uri&amp;amp;mode=documents&amp;amp;search=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1147448&#34;&gt;an aggregation tool&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;review existing annotations&lt;/strong&gt; made on this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am excited for this move JLS is making, not only because &lt;strong&gt;scholarship could be more networked and discursive&lt;/strong&gt;, but also because I see great opportunities of using web annotation to bridge learning spaces in classrooms. To me, making an annotation is forming a relationship with an idea. As educators, &lt;strong&gt;we ought to think deeply and design smartly to value such relationships as students are traversing various treks of life&lt;/strong&gt;. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://cligr.github.io/projects/discow.html&#34;&gt;our ongoing NSF project&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AERA-NSF Workshop: Data Sharing and Research Transparency (Part II)</title>
      <link>/blog/2017-07-27-data-sharing-workshop-2/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2017-07-27-data-sharing-workshop-2/</guid>
      <description>
        

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/labguest/3574677912/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;Zachary Veach&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story continued, after &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodong.ch/blog/2017/07/25/data-sharing-workshop-1.html&#34;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2.5 days of the workshop, the group continued to deepen the discussion on Data Sharing to more concrete and practical items. In Part II of my personal reflection, I summarize key Data Sharing resources/initiatives to be aware of, possible action items, and some personal random thoughts on future directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The 3-day workshop on &amp;quot;Data Sharing and Research Transparency at the Article Publishing Stage&amp;quot; comes to a close today in D.C. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/XpXIKp459g&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/XpXIKp459g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; AERA (@AERA_EdResearch) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AERA_EdResearch/status/890598718914924544&#34;&gt;July 27, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-sharing-in-education-science-the-status-quo&#34;&gt;Data Sharing in Education Science: The Status Quo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the workshop, scholars working at the frontiers of data sharing and open science presented their insights and experiences, together with officers from funding agencies (IES, NSF, NIH) and journal editors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arthurlupia.com/&#34;&gt;Skip Lupia&lt;/a&gt; (UMich), a political scientist and the Chairman of the Board of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cos.io/&#34;&gt;Center for Open Science&lt;/a&gt;, gave a talk about &lt;em&gt;Why Share, Why Now, What for?&lt;/em&gt;. He helped us unpacking two important criteria of scientific research: &lt;em&gt;credibility&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;legitimacy&lt;/em&gt;. Equally helpful was a recognition that &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; encompasses &lt;em&gt;production transparency&lt;/em&gt; (the production of data) and &lt;em&gt;analytic transparency&lt;/em&gt; (how a scholar goes from data to knowledge claims). He shared important resources from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dartstatement.org/&#34;&gt;DA-RT: Data Access and Research Transparency&lt;/a&gt; initiative and its &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dartstatement.org/2016-da-rt-journal-policy-archive&#34;&gt;TOP Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, supported by 29 top journals across disciplines. He shared preliminary evidence of &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; things like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cos.io/our-services/open-science-badges/&#34;&gt;CoS Badges&lt;/a&gt; can effectively spur the adoption of data sharing &amp;amp; research transparency practices. Finally, it was so refreshing to hear that those data sharing initiatives have been and are being championed by &lt;em&gt;qualitative&lt;/em&gt; researchers. Data sharing is indeed doable for qualitative researchers and how qualitative researchers perceive data (and I guess more specifically their ontological and epistemological commitments) are of great value to data sharing practices. This is a very important and mindbolging message that I did not expect before this workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cos.io/media/images/badges_chart.original.png&#34; alt=&#34;Source: CoS&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three recognized &lt;strong&gt;data sharing repositories&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/&#34;&gt;Inter‐university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)&lt;/a&gt; (UMich), &lt;a href=&#34;https://nyu.databrary.org/&#34;&gt;Databrary&lt;/a&gt; (PSU &amp;amp; NYU), and &lt;a href=&#34;https://qdr.syr.edu/&#34;&gt;Qualitative Data Repository (QDR)&lt;/a&gt; (Syracuse) &amp;mdash; and their leaders/PIs presented as a panel. &lt;strong&gt;It was encouraging&lt;/strong&gt; to see: 1) ICPSR&amp;rsquo;s long record of data sharing/archiving since 1962; 2) QDR as a repository focusing on qualitative data; and 3) &amp;ldquo;even&amp;rdquo; research videos are also sharable on Databrary. AERA is partnering with ICPSR to set up a dedicated repository for AERA journals, in line with AERA&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming policies on data sharing. Important questions were asked about possible impact on international researchers &amp;mdash; and non-&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/05/weird.aspx&#34;&gt;WEIRED&lt;/a&gt; populations &amp;mdash; who are automatically excluded by some data repositories&amp;rsquo; requirements of IRB approvals that are nonexistent in some countries/regions. For me, it was encouraging to learn &lt;strong&gt;existing templates and guidelines&lt;/strong&gt; made available by data sharing repositories that I could refactor for IRB protocols of my projects. Together with emerging policies made by funding agencies, professional associations, and journals, I can feel more confident about pursuing data sharing (as much as possible) when proposing a study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exiting to hear from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~maggiel/&#34;&gt;Maggie Levenstein&lt;/a&gt; (Director of ICPSR) about work on &lt;strong&gt;researcher credential building blocks&lt;/strong&gt; that&amp;rsquo;s under way. Their framework of credentials includes a researcher&amp;rsquo;s status (incl. academic, geographic, demographics), affiliation, training (e.g., in data sharing), access level, prior contributions, and violations of data stewardship. While companies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/home&#34;&gt;ResearchGate&lt;/a&gt; are inventing scores to determine researchers&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;status,&amp;rdquo; why not build a non-proprietary system to enable positive feedback loop for data sharing? A researcher credentialing system with an emphasis on data sharing could raise awareness of data sharing, give credits to those who share, and maintain reputation of data users. Exciting stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are still so many issues to be sorted out, especially from an editor&amp;rsquo;s standpoint, who may constantly face work overload and not wish to add another layer to a journal&amp;rsquo;s production pipeline. Extremely legitimate. As an early career scholar, I&amp;rsquo;m quite blind to many challenges an editor or an association&amp;rsquo;s president might be thinking about. Fortunately colleagues running data repositories may have a lot to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was helpful to hear from Lupia on the third day about &lt;em&gt;multiple levels&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;multiple dimensions&lt;/em&gt; a journal can consider when implementing data sharing practices. Check out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/4kdbm/?_ga=2.219522076.428476302.1501263281-1395141731.1501019040&#34;&gt;one-pager&lt;/a&gt; explaining 8 modular standards and 3 levels. From the lowest level, for example, a journal could &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; instead of &lt;em&gt;requiring&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; authors to put data into a repository. In terms of dimensions, a journal could consider change of &lt;em&gt;citation practices&lt;/em&gt; to reinforce secondary datasets being cited, require &lt;a href=&#34;http://egap.org/content/registration&#34;&gt;preregistration&lt;/a&gt; of (causal-inferential) research, encourage replication studies, nurture analytic transparency by asking authors to share code, and so forth. As our JLS co-editor-in-chief &lt;a href=&#34;scholar.gse.upenn.edu/yoon&#34;&gt;Susan Yoon&lt;/a&gt; nicely worded, &amp;ldquo;it seems the train has already departed, and we need to catch it.&amp;rdquo; I was thinking about a slightly different metaphor based on my experiences playing &amp;ldquo;Real-Time Strategy Games&amp;rdquo;: there are multiple pathways towards winning a game (e.g., defeating an opponent), and &lt;strong&gt;doing one thing&lt;/strong&gt; (such as collecting a lot of lamber) &lt;strong&gt;may unlock other components of winning&lt;/strong&gt;; further, in a game that requires teamwork, one player (e.g., a journal editor) could focus on one component (e.g., collecting lamber) and share to teammates, while other teammates (e.g., community advocates, data repositories) could handle other parts. We should not drain an editorial team&amp;rsquo;s limited resources to achieve everything overnight; rather, &lt;strong&gt;maybe we could create a roadmap that involves multiple types of contributors&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; authors, editors, data sharing services, funders, and maybe also publishers (for-profit or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding agencies have been actively looking into data sharing. For instance, discussions on data and data stewardship are central to NSF Programs such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=136253&#34;&gt;smart and connected communities and Internet of Things&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_repositories.html&#34;&gt;NIH has 71 data repositories&lt;/a&gt; and is very active in Genomic data sharing. To a great extent, broader impacts sought by funding agencies could become more achievable if research data &amp;mdash; collected with support from tax-payer dollars &amp;mdash; are not sitting in one team&amp;rsquo;s private server for 10 years but instead shared carefully, ethically, and with proper restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a colleague nicely said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data sharing is not a thing in addition to doing science. Data sharing is doing science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;action-items&#34;&gt;Action Items&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collective resolution has been reached near the end of the workshop and is likely to be shared by AERA soon. Below are action items that seem to me thinkable &amp;mdash; if not yet feasible &amp;mdash; for different players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: These items are in many cases my personal takeaways and do not represent official policies from funding agencies or professional associations. Some ideas are based on group discussion but may not accurately reflect what was originally said.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual researchers.&lt;/strong&gt; Study issues related to research transparency, reproducibility, replicability, etc. Get familiar with terms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-hacking&lt;/a&gt;, preregistration, reproducible research, preprints, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.researchobject.org/overview/&#34;&gt;Research Objects&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Take a hard look at our own research workflows and think about potential transparency/reproducibility hazards &amp;mdash; which could be related to how we name files, store research memos, document R codes, backup data, etc. Stay current with existing data sharing guidelines from funders, journals, and research societies &amp;mdash; as the train has ignited its engine if not yet departed. Seek support from our institutions, libraries, data stewards, etc. For those ahead of the game, publish your codes in Github, package algorithms in an R package, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very important point made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/robyn_read&#34;&gt;Robyn Read&lt;/a&gt; (an early career peer &amp;amp; also an OISE alumnus): academia has been quite intolerant of failures and mistakes. We get afraid of missteps at every stage of a research project. How about making &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.frontiersin.org/about/review-system&#34;&gt;peer-review more collaborative&lt;/a&gt;? How about putting drafts/preprints out there early on for open discussions (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/16/3761/2016/acp-16-3761-2016-discussion.html&#34;&gt;this paper originally shared as a draft&lt;/a&gt;)? There are certain norms in academia possibly ripe for &lt;em&gt;disruption&lt;/em&gt; (a word I typically don&amp;rsquo;t like using).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faculty members.&lt;/strong&gt; Engage students in conversations, in our labs or methodology courses. Point them to training resources on campus or online (webinars, MOOCs, manuals). Help them stay calm, even when we aren&amp;rsquo;t :-). Maybe even develop new courses about research transparency and reproducible research &amp;mdash; typically nonexistent in colleges of Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional associations and their journals.&lt;/strong&gt; Convey messages to association members and share exemplars. Expect non-supportive reactions and resistance. Treat resistance as good opportunities of conversations, as a colleague said. Engage members &amp;mdash; esp. international members &amp;mdash; in conversations about data sharing at board meetings, conferences, webinars, doctoral consortia, etc. Talk with other journals under a same society, journals in a same field by &amp;ldquo;reside&amp;rdquo; somewhere else, and journals from other fields. Identify early-starters of data sharing and engage them in training and conversations. Maybe consider a new award category for data sharing or research transparency/reproducibility (suggested by Skip).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data repositories.&lt;/strong&gt; I look forward to digging into datasets already living in those repositories and studying their resources for IRB preparation. For example, to me knowing data sharing is not the same as making data totally open to anyone was helpful (see the tweet below). It would be very useful if data repositories could further provide dataset exemplars. A 3-minute video walkthrough about the process of depositing a dataset will also help. These resources would help us get a more concrete understanding of data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;One example ICPSR dataset showing ways to protect data: the words &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataSharing?src=hash&#34;&gt;#DataSharing&lt;/a&gt; sound scary but there are strategies &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/MfZqqUSWxf&#34;&gt;https://t.co/MfZqqUSWxf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/FUpfc3SZNh&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FUpfc3SZNh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bod0ng/status/890211031720611842&#34;&gt;July 26, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universities and research institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; IRB practices are evolving as well. My institution, the University of Minnesota, hosted IRB Town Halls last academic year discussing the changing landscape of Compliance &amp;amp; Ethics. Engage IRB offices in data sharing conversations, if not yet. Also important is a university&amp;rsquo;s willingness to back up its researchers&amp;rsquo; ethical data sharing practices and stand with them against possible vicious attacks. Just like many universities are backing up their faculty members&amp;rsquo; fair-use claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;towards-my-dream-world&#34;&gt;Towards My Dream World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop was so helpful in getting me to think more deeply about data sharing and possible actions I can take as a researcher, faculty member, new investigator, author, international person whose home country&amp;rsquo;s ethical review practice is still emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I explore a few other components touched upon (implicitly) during the workshop. I am quite excited about them even though they are still vague and paradoxical to me, or are totally against our current norms and routines. So I&amp;rsquo;m now throwing them out there for further discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control.&lt;/strong&gt; Before attending the workshop, I thought data sharing is to put data out there &amp;mdash; totally public and totally beyond one&amp;rsquo;s control after data get shared. That is a scary scene for many of us. As researchers, we can still remain a certain level of control over a shared dataset &amp;mdash; not based on whether we like a data requester or whether a requested usage contradicts our published findings.. But it seems &lt;strong&gt;controls pre- and post-sharing&lt;/strong&gt; are areas that could be further discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;rsquo;m especially curious about possible controls after data sharing (&lt;em&gt;post-sharing&lt;/em&gt;). Linked to work on researcher credentials, data repositories could have an opportunity to think twice about a data request from someone with many previous violations. For data sharers, they may wish to be able to track who are accessing my shared data, how, and where results are published; so are data repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to post-sharing controls, we also image a shared dataset to keep evolving after secondary analysts invest time to recode, reshape, or link them. When we allow a new version of a dataset to appear? Or do we allow a dataset to fork? Who can make these judgements? Intriguing questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about research participants? While our currently practices seek clearcut delimiters of data ownership/stewardship in a lifecycle of project. For example, when an informed consent is made, we say data ownership is transferred from a participant to a researcher; similarly, when a dataset gets submitted to shared to a repository after de-identification, we see another change of data ownership and stewardship. However, &lt;strong&gt;in a deeply connected world, should research participants remain control of their own data?&lt;/strong&gt; Would it be more ethical if participants have the choice to stay aware of work conducted on data they contributed &amp;mdash; while remaining hidden from data users? This may seem totally quite counter-intuitive. But see yourself the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kavlifoundation.org/kavli-human-project&#34;&gt;Kavli HUMAN project&lt;/a&gt;, the shift &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iftf.org/techfutureslab/?utm_content=buffer27233&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer&#34;&gt;from an Internet of Information to an Internet of Actions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-potential-for-blockchain-to-transform-electronic-health-records&#34;&gt;a move to store medical records on blockchains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitous networking has transformed cyberspace into a pervasive layer atop our physical reality.  (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iftf.org/techfutureslab/?utm_content=buffer27233&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;re the implications on research data? What does it mean to data sharing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linked data and maintained contexts.&lt;/strong&gt;  Information loss accompanies the lifecycle of research data &amp;ndash; from collection, cleansing, transformation, analysis, synthesis, publication, to meta-analysis&amp;hellip; We are increasingly losing the context where data were originally collected. In a &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; connected world, as described above, how about data sharing is not too distant from where data originally reside? &lt;strong&gt;Data sharing is just like adding faces and masks to data and selectively expose data to secondary users?&lt;/strong&gt; In my experiences with secondary data, I saw data shared in forms PDFs, CSVs, Excels, JSONs, and XMLs. How about we say those data formats or shapes all suck, and we wish to (safely &amp;amp; ethically) maintain possible connectivity when sharing data instead of cutting connections?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader conceptions of value and incentives.&lt;/strong&gt; I shared an idea in a breakout group discussion about crediting data sharers with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency&#34;&gt;crypto- or digital currency&lt;/a&gt;, with which they can &amp;ldquo;purchase&amp;rdquo; other data. Like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum&#34;&gt;Ethereum blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, data sharers share data with &amp;ldquo;smart contracts&amp;rdquo; attached to them and users &amp;ldquo;pay&amp;rdquo; a price in a digital currency based on their status (e.g. free for a student or a researcher without funding, a fair amount for someone having funding, expensive for someone with many prior violations). One colleague said this &amp;ldquo;monetization&amp;rdquo; was against the spirit of data sharing. Probably. But is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intention of mentioning digital currencies was simply &lt;strong&gt;to recognize value generated by research work&lt;/strong&gt;. For data sharing, if citations to a shared dataset with DOIs provide an &amp;ldquo;alternate currency&amp;rdquo; worth considering for tenure promotion. What else mechanisms could be created to promote and facilitate data sharing and &amp;mdash; research integrity, in general? I would argue citations might be too narrow, and not &lt;em&gt;enabling&lt;/em&gt; enough. My citation count may signal my prior achievements and help me get funded. But how many grant proposals can I possibly write each year? And a citation count does not represent my reputation in research collaboration, data sharing, peer review, conference organization, etc. &lt;strong&gt;As academics, what values do we generate from our work? How to give ourselves credit (not until once in a lifetime tenure promotions)?&lt;/strong&gt; Crazy? Maybe. But academia is outsourcing &amp;mdash; if not losing &amp;mdash; values generated by us to others &amp;ndash; for-profit publishers, data-rich startups, etc. See the fight for Open Access against the &amp;ldquo;paywall&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/sci-hub-s-cache-pirated-papers-so-big-subscription-journals-are-doomed-data-analyst&#34;&gt;sometimes in dramatic unlawful manners&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/hate-journal-impact-factors-new-study-gives-you-one-more-reason&#34;&gt;our love-hate relationship with the Impact Factor&lt;/a&gt; or other algorithms like &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;-index that influence who get jobs, tenure, and grants. We can stay proud of those nicely formatted PDFs published in high Impact-Factor journals. But what other things can we care more about? If we&amp;rsquo;re not standing with various types of value generated by our work &amp;mdash; during data collect, data analysis, peer review, journal editing, etc. &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s probably a matter of time another startup or rich company to claim ownership of a piece of our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ten years later &lt;strong&gt;learning is earning&lt;/strong&gt; (see the video below), &lt;strong&gt;I predict data sharing, and other value generation or value sharing activities in scholarly research, will also be recognized &amp;mdash; not necessarily with money but with something that can more holistically represent the value of our work and can be used/transacted to enable further scholarly activities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, my heartfelt thanks to our leaders &amp;mdash; esp. Dr. Felice levine from AERA and Drs. Susan Yoon, Jan van Aalst &amp;amp; Bill Sandoval from &lt;a href=&#34;isls.org&#34;&gt;ISLS&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; in engaging me in this exciting and rewarding journey. I look forward to working further on data sharing and in various inter-related areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001779.g001&#34;&gt;Roche et al. 2014&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an honor to be invited to attend the AERA-NSF Workshop on &lt;em&gt;Data Sharing and Research Transparency at the Article Publishing Stage&lt;/em&gt; in Washington, D.C. during July 25‐27, 2017. I am attending as an early career scholar from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://isls.org/&#34;&gt;International Society of the Learning Sciences&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; my academic home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only a half-day into the workshop but I&amp;rsquo;m already amazed by so many great thoughts from a full room of journal editors, program officers from funding agencies, and early career peers. Below I&amp;rsquo;m sharing some general (not necessarily representative) themes of ideas discussed so far at the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-sharing-where-are-we&#34;&gt;Data Sharing: Where Are We?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the conference, Dr. Felice J. Levine, the workshop convener from AERA, shared out the classic National Academies Report on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nap.edu/catalog/2033.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing Research Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was released in 1985. I read it on my flight into D.C. and it was a worth read. What stroke me was: many thoughts I compiled in preparation of the workshop were already elaborated in this 32-year-old report. The value of data sharing is not newly recognized. Many challenges have persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before reading this report, I happened to read a much newer article titled &lt;em&gt;Administrative social science data: The challenge of reproducible research&lt;/em&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Big Data &amp;amp; Society&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; a journal I reviewed for. There are some clear advancements the social science communities (and scholarly communities in general) have made since 1985. For instance, we have various research tools and platforms available these days to facilitate data management, sharing, and publishing. &lt;em&gt;Git&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; a version control system highly recommended by this article &amp;mdash; was nonexistent when the National Academies Report came out; neither were platforms and initiatives such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/&#34;&gt;Open Science Framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataverse.org/&#34;&gt;Harvard Dataverse Network&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://figshare.com/&#34;&gt;Figshare&lt;/a&gt;. However, when juxtaposing challenges discussed in both pieces, what stroke me &amp;mdash; again &amp;mdash; was how slow it has been to shift academic cultures to promote data sharing. Indeed, developing tools are easier, whereas changing cultures at many levels &amp;mdash; e.g., in research labs, departments and colleges, institutions, associations, funding agencies &amp;mdash; are much much more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion-themes&#34;&gt;Discussion Themes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perspectives from these two pieces were echoed in a round of self-intros at the workshop this afternoon. Below are some keywords I noted, which again, reflect my own bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data.&lt;/strong&gt; One important point was made about what we mean by &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;. This is not only about the traditional dichotomy of qualitative vs. quantitative data, but also &amp;mdash; purposes of data, power relations in data and data systems (e.g., whom are served by data), &lt;a href=&#34;http://learning-analytics.info/journals/index.php/JLA/issue/view/405/showToc&#34;&gt;shapes of data&lt;/a&gt;, etc. I recently wrote in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317586037_Unpacking_Learning_Analytics_An_Attempt_to_Tilt_the_Iceberg_in_Chinese&#34;&gt;an invited think piece in Chinese&lt;/a&gt; about how the term &lt;em&gt;data (数据)&lt;/em&gt; originally meant punishing people in ancient Chinese. In the same vein, one colleague commented on the word &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt; being dirty to Indigenous peoples. These views apply here in educational research data as well and therefore in data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contexts&lt;/em&gt; of research data are also extremely important. Data shared without sufficient information about their context are useless. This fact places burden on both initial investigators who share data (because they need to explain the context in prep for data sharing) and secondary analysts who need to understand the context (often based on insufficient documentation). More work is probably needed to further unpack &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;, and to articulate data that are shareable, situations where data are meaningful to be shared, and constituents of shared data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture and practices.&lt;/strong&gt; I believe this topic was mostly discussed so far. Subtopics include &lt;em&gt;incentives&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;disincentives&lt;/em&gt; related to data sharing, which are explored in depth in the National Academies Report. For an assistant professor like me, for example, the current tenure process does not credit my investment in data sharing or data publishing. Even if I publish a dataset with a DOI attached to it, it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t carry the same weight as an empirical piece in a top journal. An editor mentioned it&amp;rsquo;s also considered &amp;ldquo;suboptimal&amp;rdquo; for someone&amp;rsquo;s tenure case to publish a study based on secondary data. While there is currently less credit given to data sharing practices, disincentives abound, which are also elaborated in the National Academies Report. Therefore, data sharing does not only need a few mavericks but systematic investments to incentify and sustain culture changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics.&lt;/strong&gt; Another major concern was ethical challenges related to data sharing. It was refreshing to hear from one senior colleague sharing that patients whose data were collected for medical research were eager to have their data shared, because they wished to contribute to the quest for a cure, while laws and ethics guidelines prohibit sharing of personal health data. For me as an early career scholar, I tend to make &amp;ldquo;the minimal ask&amp;rdquo; when preparing my IRB protocols &amp;mdash; only because the IRB work with an IRB office and a school district is already so daunting for someone who&amp;rsquo;s still navigating the systems. I worry that being ambitious in data sharing would undermine the likelihood of getting research protocols approved. In addition to putting a sentence to a journal&amp;rsquo;s homepage saying &amp;ldquo;you should share your data&amp;rdquo;, we need additional resources to help scholars deal with ethical challenges even before a study is conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; Numerous initiatives have emerged to support data sharing, and open science in general. I look forward to experts who are in the forefront of these matters to share their work. For example, colleagues from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cos.io/&#34;&gt;Center for Open Science&lt;/a&gt;, which has developed systems like the Open Science Framework and OSF Preprints, will present tomorrow. As an advocate of open science, I am also intrigued by recent work by writing &amp;amp; preprint platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;authorea.com&#34;&gt;Authorea&lt;/a&gt; and code sharing platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://codeocean.com/about&#34;&gt;Code Ocean&lt;/a&gt; which do not only allow sharing of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.researchobject.org/overview/&#34;&gt;Research Objects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but more interactive forms of scholarly discourse &amp;amp; content consumption (e.g., interactive visualizations linked with shared data and directly embedded in publications). So, technically we are (almost) there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value.&lt;/strong&gt; At the dinner table, it was refreshing to hear from senior scholars how they had to mail out their manuscripts when submitting to a journal and how they needed to fax their reviews to a journal/conference. At that time, the manuscript was almost the only thing others can see from someone&amp;rsquo;s work. We talked about how we can now assign &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; to so many &amp;ldquo;middle-products&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;byproducts&amp;rdquo; of academic research in addition to an article as an end-product. This is linked to a point made in &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodong.ch/blog/2017/07/24/value-in-education.html&#34;&gt;my last blog&lt;/a&gt; post about the need to expand &lt;em&gt;valuation&lt;/em&gt; in education to include artifacts generated in learning processes. After reading emerging, draft guidelines that encourage and, in some cases, enforce citations of shared data, I&amp;rsquo;m increasingly optimistic about new cultures of research and publishing that are yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In his arguments against the &lt;em&gt;Common Core&lt;/em&gt;, Prof. Yong Zhao, a known educational thinker, &lt;a href=&#34;http://zhaolearning.com/2011/09/11/if-lady-gaga-can-be-useful/&#34;&gt;referred to his home village&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, the most valued talent was the ability to handle water buffalos used to plow the rice field, other than physical strengths to carry things such as newly harvested rice or sweet potatoes. I don’t know for sure how good a water buffalo handler she [Lady Gaga] could be, but I am quite sure she will not be able to run on bumpy muddy paths with 200 pounds of sweet potatoes dangling on each end of a bamboo pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(See &lt;a href=&#34;http://zhaolearning.com/2011/09/11/if-lady-gaga-can-be-useful/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If Lady Gaga Can be Useful&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The village I grew up happens to be only ~20 miles away from Zhao&amp;rsquo;s. And the situation was the same. As a matter of fact, my grandparents never learned to handle a water buffalo. When it came the season to plow the fields, they had to hire experts &amp;mdash; a situation that could be tough when the only buffalo became fully booked. And as picky farmers, they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hire any random, potentially lousy buffalo handlers, who might plow shallowly (to save the buffalo&amp;rsquo;s energy) and jeopardize the harvest of a whole year. Indeed, for my grandparents&amp;rsquo; generation in the village, knowing how to handle a water buffalo was valuable, more valuable than going to schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things changed for my parents&amp;rsquo; generation. They saw growing value of formal education. My dad became the first one of his generation in the family to enter a &amp;ldquo;teacher&amp;rsquo;s school&amp;rdquo; (equivalent to high school) and to land a teaching job with a monthly paycheck. My mom went to high school but narrowly missed college. What became remarkable in their careers was the value of &lt;strong&gt;a diploma&lt;/strong&gt;, with which my dad went on to work as a teacher, received additional training, and is now leading a small team in a local educational department. My mom, with &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; a high-school diploma, has been teaching for decades but is not recognized as a formal member of the teaching force. The differences a diploma could make came up a million times at our dinner table. So my parents&amp;rsquo; shared dream was to send me to college &amp;mdash; to get an even better diploma from a much bigger place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pursuit for advanced degrees became exactly what my generation was all about. While my parents could not fully invest in schoolwork because they had to take care of their families, my generation was generally sucked into homework and crazy amounts of standardized tests. I did get a high-school diploma like my mom and ventured 2,000 miles to Beijing for &lt;strong&gt;a college degree&lt;/strong&gt;, which led me to opportunities of doing what I&amp;rsquo;m doing &amp;mdash; a huge privilege for a kid whose dream was as big and as far as going to college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From handling a water buffalo to holding a respected diploma/degree, what is seen as &lt;em&gt;valuable&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;having value&lt;/em&gt;, has dramatically shifted across three generations in my family. If formal education is conceptualized as an activity leading to an outcome. For my grandparents, the outcome was not as valuable as being able to handle a water buffalo. For my parents and myself, the outcome was a diploma, certificate or degree, which accreditates knowledge as &amp;ldquo;entities&amp;rdquo; passed onto us through education and entitles us to work on certain jobs or to pursuit new goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, what will happen for my son&amp;rsquo;s generation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be possible when my son graduates from college, there is no or very few jobs. This is not being pessimist about the economy, but a reality check given the rise of &lt;strong&gt;automation and artificial intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;. As a report published by McKinsey claims, automation and artificial intelligence could readily carry out 45% of paid activities across the U.S. economy, influencing about 60% of all occupations. While routine tasks in manufacturing, transportation and food service is already being automated, &lt;strong&gt;jobs requiring creativity and emotions are where humanity will be seeking meaningful work in the foreseeable future&lt;/strong&gt; [1]. Even if technical feasibility of automation does not guarantee adoption, education &amp;mdash; which has been (partially) charged with workforce preparation &amp;mdash; is facing hard questions. What if an education does not lead to a job, because there is no, or not enough, jobs? Are curriculum standards limiting the scope of education to areas that would be soon automated? How the &amp;ldquo;achievement gap&amp;rdquo; will be re-lived (not relieved) in an era when the meaning of achievement will be fundamentally redefined?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are enduring another &amp;mdash; and maybe even bigger &amp;mdash; shift in &lt;em&gt;valuation&lt;/em&gt; in education and learning.&lt;/strong&gt; For my grandparents, formal education was irrelevant and learning in schools was too detached from their daily lives. What mattered for them was learning knowledge &lt;em&gt;in-use&lt;/em&gt; and of practical value, like handling a water buffalo, which was not valued in education. This situation changed for my parents&amp;rsquo; and my generation, as formal accreditations from educational institutions are not only relevant but connected to &lt;em&gt;social mobility&lt;/em&gt; more than ever before. Degrees, certificates and transcripts given by respected institutions are trusted accreditation of acquired knowledge and skills valued by curriculum standards. With a teaching certificate, my dad became eligible to teach. With a university degree, many doors opened for me. &lt;strong&gt;These credentials carry great amounts of value and trust&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; not determined by learners and educational institutions, but the broader changing societal landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;one issue with this model is these credentials mark the endpoints of educational experiences which are put in a &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; for outsiders&lt;/strong&gt; and are not consistently regarded by the credentialing process in different societies, institutions, departments, or even different iterations of a same course. And yet a same GPA from a same school is equivalently valued, because it is the only thing that gets valued and remains visible after a learning journey is &amp;ldquo;done.&amp;rdquo; Things that get produced in learning towards these credentials are largely disregarded and discarded during credentialing; in most cases, they are not seen as generating value at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only quite recently in &lt;em&gt;new cultures of learning&lt;/em&gt; [2], where artifacts generated in learning are more recognized. Exciting projects are emerging, e.g., &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.badgealliance.org/&#34;&gt;Open Badges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and the newer &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://utx.edu/chainscript-iti-present/&#34;&gt;Transcripts on blockchain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which open up new ways to credit learning. Specifically, we can now credit a broader range of learner achievements, democratize the practice of credentialing, and give learners stronger control over their credentials. &lt;strong&gt;However, in many cases a new technology is adopted to embrace an old educational model &amp;mdash; or more precisely an old valuation model that disregards learning in-situ or knowledge that exists in &lt;em&gt;flows&lt;/em&gt; of participation, collaboration, and authentic problem-solving.&lt;/strong&gt; If automation and artificial intelligence are taking away jobs, and if future generations can only find meaningful work at the &amp;ldquo;creative end,&amp;rdquo; some larger questions regarding value and valuation need to be discussed. In the newer context of broad and deep automation, and after decades of discussing &lt;em&gt;21st century competencies&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should be seen as having value in learning processes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are entitled to the act of valuation, if not (only) traditional institutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After valuation, how would value be presented? And to whom?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will future learners get paid to learn? Or for what they produce &amp;mdash; such as artifacts, meaningful social connections, something contributing to public goods &amp;mdash; in learning processes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the roles of a curriculum?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How equatable opportunities could be ensured given existing gaps and new divides introduced by any new valuation model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am curious about your responses to these bizarre or maybe unanswerable questions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Graphing the Reddit Place Sensation with Neo4j</title>
      <link>/blog/2017-04-10-graphing-reddit-place/</link>

      <description>
        

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ver never liked the April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day, until this year when &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/&#34;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; decided to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/62mesr/place/&#34;&gt;launch a social experiment&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/place/&#34;&gt;Reddit Place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple. The whole world &amp;ndash; or all Reddit users &amp;ndash; were given a 999 x 999 blank canvas to draw on. Some simple rules apply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each user could choose one pixel from 16 colors to place anywhere on the canvas. They could place as many pixels of as many colors as they wanted, but they had to wait a few minutes between placing each one. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the following 72 hours, amazingly interesting things happened on this 999 x 999 canvas. Below is a gif that gives you a glimpse into what had happened. Numerous accounts of this event have been posted. See &lt;a href=&#34;http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for a good overview, and more posts can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/place&#34;&gt;Reddit Place&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.redd.it/5p68ukzkwdpy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;graphing-the-reddit-place-with-neo4j&#34;&gt;Graphing the Reddit Place with Neo4j&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reddit Place as a web-based social phenomenon will be remembered and studied by many people. I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow this event at all but was amazed by the various types of participating users, sub-communities who self-organized to achieve certain goals, clashes and fights, evolving rules, impressive artworks, and so on &amp;ndash; all that happened on this little canvas. I&amp;rsquo;m especially intrigued by the emergent, self-organizing processes of constructing, destructing, negotiating, and re-constructing among numerous users and user networks supported by all kinds of communication tools (mostly Reddit itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaceDevs/comments/637ynq/a_datadump_but_from_a_different_scraper/&#34;&gt;a data dump&lt;/a&gt; that captured the history of this event, I could not resist myself from playing with it using &lt;a href=&#34;https://neo4j.com/&#34;&gt;Neo4j&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;importing-data&#34;&gt;Importing data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, I wrote the following Cypher scripts to import the csv dump into Neo4j:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight cypher %}
// Set constraints
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Point) ASSERT p.location IS UNIQUE;
CREATE INDEX ON :User(name);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Insert data
USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV FROM &amp;ldquo;file:///export.csv&amp;rdquo; AS l
WITH l, [toInt(l[1]), toInt(l[2])] AS loc
WHERE l[3] IS NOT NULL
MERGE (p:Point {location: loc})
  ON CREATE SET p.location = loc, p.count = 1
  ON MATCH SET p.count = p.count + 1
MERGE (u:User {name: l[3]})
  ON CREATE SET u.name = l[3], u.count = 1
  ON MATCH SET u.count = u.count + 1
MERGE (u)-[r:PAINT]-&amp;gt;(p)
  ON CREATE SET r.count = 1, r.ids = [toInt(l[0])],
    r.colors = [toInt(l[4])], r.times = [toInt(l[5])]
  ON MATCH SET r.count = r.count + 1,
    r.ids = r.ids + toInt(l[0]),
    r.colors = r.colors + toInt(l[4]),
    r.times = r.times + toInt(l[5]);
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure below demonstrates the &lt;em&gt;graph model&lt;/em&gt; of the created Neo4j graph database. The model is quite simple and intuitive, including two node types named &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; and one relationship type named &lt;code&gt;Paint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/article_images/r-place-graph-model.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took my computer ~22 minutes to create 1.6 million labels, 1.6 million nodes, 28.8 million properties, and 4.13 million relationships in this graph database, the size of which ended up to be 4.30 GB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-queries&#34;&gt;General queries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After data were loaded, I did some quick queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, who were the most active users?&lt;/strong&gt; User &lt;code&gt;itsnotlupus&lt;/code&gt; won the game as s/he painted for 177 times. This may not sound much but if you multiple 177 by 5 minutes (the &amp;lsquo;cooldown&amp;rsquo; time), you will find the user spent roughly 15 hours painting or contemplating the next pixel on the canvas. This time amount does not include activities in other communication tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did &lt;code&gt;itsnotlupus&lt;/code&gt; paint?&lt;/strong&gt; Below is a graph showing this user (in the center) and 100 pixels s/he painted on. Note that each pixel is identified by its coordinates in the 2D canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/article_images/top-user.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed this user painted a whole lot near &lt;code&gt;Point [380, 880]&lt;/code&gt;. By clicking on the [380, 881] Point node, see below, I could check who else have painted on that spot. 16 other users have painted there. Maybe there were some interesting collisions on that single pixel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/article_images/top-user-clashes.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which colors did &lt;code&gt;itsnotlupus&lt;/code&gt; use?&lt;/strong&gt; It appeared &lt;code&gt;itsnotlupus&lt;/code&gt; painted &lt;span style=&#34;background-color:#e59500&#34;&gt;#E59500&lt;/span&gt; for 104 times, and &lt;span style=&#34;background-color:#e50000&#34;&gt;#E50000&lt;/span&gt; for 70 times. Do those two colors belong to specific clans &lt;code&gt;itsnotlupus&lt;/code&gt; was affiliated with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight cypher %}
MATCH (u:User {name: &amp;ldquo;itsnotlupus&amp;rdquo;})-[r:PAINT]-&amp;gt;()
WITH collect(r.colors) as colors
UNWIND colors as array
UNWIND array as color
RETURN color, count(color) as count
ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-blue-corner&#34;&gt;The Blue Corner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, the lower-right corner was occupied by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueCorner/&#34;&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt;. So I checked the corner pixel [999, 999]. The following Cypher query returned a total of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;10,121&lt;/code&gt; user actions on that single pixel&lt;/strong&gt;. The figure that follows shows 100 of those users who painted at [999, 999].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight cypher %}
MATCH (p:Point {location: [999, 999]})&amp;lt;-[r:PAINT]-()
RETURN count&amp;reg;
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/article_images/999x999-users.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top painters in that corner&lt;/strong&gt; are listed in the figure below. Querying the top [999, 999] painter &lt;code&gt;MrMeltJr&lt;/code&gt; I found him painting &lt;span style=&#34;text-shadow: 4px 4px 2px #0000EA&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blue (#0000EA)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; predominantly (105 out of 116 times). He was clearly a member of the Blue Corner sub-community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/article_images/999x999-top-users.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the most used color in that corner?&lt;/strong&gt; The following query found the most dominant color to be &lt;span style=&#34;text-shadow: 4px 4px 2px #0000EA&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#0000EA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which appeared for 7400 times, followed by &lt;span style=&#34;text-shadow: 4px 4px 2px #820080&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#820080&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 2055 times. This finding could be confirmed by the gif above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight cypher %}
MATCH (p:Point {location: [999, 999]})&amp;lt;-[r:PAINT]-()
WITH collect(r.colors) as allColors
UNWIND allColors as array
UNWIND array as color
RETURN color, count(color) as count ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-fun-to-come&#34;&gt;More Fun to Come&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These queries are far from even scratching the surface of the complex social phenomenon. Two aspects I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in exploring (if I have time) are the &lt;code&gt;temporal&lt;/code&gt; aspect of user actions on single pixels and the &lt;code&gt;spacial&lt;/code&gt; aspect of changes with neighboring pixels. In addition, it would also be useful if we could connect communication and coordination among users and communities external to the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, now I see the April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day could be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Windchill, and Validity in Learning Analytics</title>
      <link>/blog/2016-11-14-windchill-learning-analytics/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/onepointfour/16460554715&#34;&gt;Dustin Gaffke&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;windchill&#34;&gt;Windchill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was listening to a science radio program the other (other) night when the host was talking about &amp;lsquo;windchill being &lt;em&gt;inaccurate&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rsquo; even though many of us have never questioned its accuracy at all. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-is-wind-chill-real/&#34;&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt; has published an article on the same topic, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind chill is a mathematically derived number that approximates how cold your skin &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;not how cold your skin actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;hellip; Wind carries some of that heat away, however, and the faster the wind, the faster the heat loss. Once the wind surpasses 25 mph or so, it whisks away heat more quickly than your body can emit it, leaving your skin exposed to the full low temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the windchill number I check every day in winter (yea, I live in Minneapolis) is actually based on a formula, with air temperature and wind speed as two most critical factors. The central issue discussed in the radio program was there are a bunch of formulas and none of them are definitely accurate. Based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/winter/windchill/wind-chill-formulas.htm&#34;&gt;this article from USA Today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new formulas are based on greater scientific knowledge and on experiments that tested how fast the faces of volunteers cooled in a wind tunnel with various combinations of wind and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone may continue to ask: Well, there could be a range of factors leading to inaccuracy of even the newest formulas. One is humidity in air. Another one is those volunteers&amp;rsquo; perception of coolness which may be influence by their body fat and tolerance of cool temperature. This list could keep growing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the definition of &lt;em&gt;windchill&lt;/em&gt; below, my understanding of it gets even muddier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quantity expressing the effective lowering of the air temperature caused by the wind, especially as affecting the rate of heat loss from an object or human body or as perceived by an exposed person. (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/windchill&#34;&gt;Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it mean the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; air temperature gets lowered or the &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; temperature from a subjective human? Do we consider windchill for an object like a chair? How about an object with different levels of humidity or heat? Such a definition, together with a bunch of other conflicting definitions (e.g., on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;), is getting me nowhere in understanding what windchill really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, people including me still find windchill useful, especially if they grew up in a warmer place and got fooled by winter days with bright sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ![Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/winter/winter-images/windchill.gif) --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;validity-accountability-and-integrity-in-learning-analytics&#34;&gt;Validity, Accountability, and Integrity in Learning Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the debates on windchill are interesting because this concept seems to combine both &lt;em&gt;objective reality&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;human-constructed perception&lt;/em&gt; together. If there is a &amp;ldquo;scientifically&amp;rdquo; validated formula that can validly and reliably handle the lowering of the actual air temperature, how could scientists &amp;ndash; and the public &amp;ndash; reach a consensus on the human perception part?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue sounds a lot like long-standing &amp;ldquo;paradigmatic wars&amp;rdquo; in education research and more recent discussions of validity in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics&#34;&gt;learning analytics&lt;/a&gt;, none of which are going away anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for learning analytics, broader concerns on &lt;em&gt;accountability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;integrity&lt;/em&gt; could kick in as well, in addition to an algorithm&amp;rsquo;s capability in capturing the &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; of learning processes. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://simon.buckinghamshum.net/2016/03/algorithmic-accountability-for-learning-analytics/&#34;&gt;a provocative blog post by Simon Buckingham Shum&lt;/a&gt;, he situates this discussion in a broader societal dependence on algorithms (e.g., search engines, social feeds, airport security check); while he argues for more algorithmic transparency and accountability, he also calls for a more wholistic view of the &amp;lsquo;analytics cycle&amp;rsquo; and proposes to focus on the &lt;em&gt;Analytic System Integrity&lt;/em&gt; instead of algorithms that only constitute a part of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interpretation is that for any learning analytic to navigate the nuanced space involving various stakeholders and agents (including algorithms), the unidimensional focus on algorithmic validity is not getting us very far. While there are numerous ways to err in the learning analytics cycle &amp;ndash; which &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; include data collection, data wrangling (cleaning, integration, transformation), analysis, modeling, representation (visualization), sense-making, action-taking, and so on &amp;ndash; one promising approach is to always remain open to conversations &amp;ndash; conversations among stakeholders, data, socio-technical environments, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about the discussion of validity in learning analytics is to reflect on a &lt;em&gt;positivist&lt;/em&gt; orientation underlying many learning analytics solutions, especially those that aim for predictions with high-stake consequences (e.g., identifying at-risk students). A &lt;em&gt;positivist&lt;/em&gt; orientation may help vendors sell their products, as it supports claims of &amp;lsquo;rigor&amp;rsquo; leading to client buy-in. However, together with widespread opaque or &amp;lsquo;black-box&amp;rsquo; algorithms, this orientation may also throttle important conversations and set the stage for nonproductive questioning or interrogations of a solution. Therefore, instead of being fixed upon validity in a positivist term, it could be wise to recognize the problem-solving nature of learning analytics and embrace a &lt;em&gt;pragmatist&lt;/em&gt; orientation. In that way, &lt;strong&gt;we will not only look for validity of algorithms, but more broadly for &lt;em&gt;usefulness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;credibility&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;trustworthiness&lt;/em&gt; that are situated in a wholistic analytic system&lt;/strong&gt;. In this case, we will not pretend to invent a solution that fits all, but will engage in tuning an analytic in a local context and more modestly look at &lt;em&gt;transferability&lt;/em&gt; (instead of external validity) among near-neighbor contexts, with &lt;em&gt;dependability&lt;/em&gt; of a solution documented for potential transferability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably what we can learn from the windchill discussion is that various formulas &amp;ndash; less complex than learning analytics solutions (if I may claim) &amp;ndash; are transparent and open to conversations. Its &lt;em&gt;usefulness&lt;/em&gt; can therefore be more likely to be appreciated, rather than being dismissed by endless questioning of its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MOOCs, Open Universities, and Learning Analytics in Asia</title>
      <link>/blog/2016-11-03-trip-to-asia/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2016-11-03-trip-to-asia/</guid>
      <description>
        

&lt;p&gt;My October ended with a trip to Asia &amp;ndash; Beijing and Manila this time. Visiting Beijing was like going back to an ever-changing hometown, while visiting Manila (where I&amp;rsquo;ve never been before) was like venturing into a rain forest. Both very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moocs-in-china-research-and-practice&#34;&gt;MOOCs in China: Research and Practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days in Beijing was filled by a busy &lt;a href=&#34;http://xlearningcenter.com/nd.jsp?id=137&amp;amp;_np=2_302&#34;&gt;MOOC conference&lt;/a&gt; agenda, working meetings at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://xlearningcenter.com/&#34;&gt;X-Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; on a MOOC project, and casual exchanges with graduate students at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://web5.pku.edu.cn/jyxyen/&#34;&gt;Graduate School of Education&lt;/a&gt; at Peking University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;MOOC Forum for Doctoral Students&lt;/em&gt; organized by the X-Learning Center gathered around 130 participants from around the country. Among these participants, many of them are professors who have been developing courses for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icourses.cn/home/&#34;&gt;iCourses&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese MOOC platform that originated from the national Chinese Top Level Courses initiative (see Stian Haklev&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://reganmian.net/blog/2011/06/01/chinese-translation-of-ma-thesis-on-top-level-courses-available/&#34;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xuetangx.com/&#34;&gt;xuetangX&lt;/a&gt;, the largest MOOC provider in China. Some other participants are involved in MOOC research, on aspects such as MOOC learners&amp;rsquo; behavioral patterns, online discussions, dashboard design, user experiences, SPOC, MOOC quality indicators, etc. It was quite amazing to see such intensive interests first-hand &amp;ndash; in both practice and research &amp;ndash; even though it&amp;rsquo;s not a secret that MOOC is really &amp;lsquo;massive&amp;rsquo; in such a massive country. However, I need to admit my limited understanding of MOOC research in China because of access barriers and the implicit &amp;ldquo;hierarchy&amp;rdquo; of academic journals internationally. For example, the X-Learning Center directed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B2738UQJ?site=xueshu_ri&#34;&gt;Dr. Q Wang&lt;/a&gt; has been prolific in publishing their work on MOOCs, but it would be difficult for anyone who 1) cannot read Chinese or 2) cannot access the Chinese Academic Index to read their work. How can we do better than &amp;lsquo;inviting&amp;rsquo; such scholars to publish in English?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the final day of the conference, I presented a keynote on &amp;ldquo;Mapping the Terrain of MOOC Research,&amp;rdquo; together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.edu.hku.hk/staff/academic/gwchen&#34;&gt;Dr. Gaowei Chen&lt;/a&gt; from Hong Kong University who presented his research on online discussion. Aiming to inspire doctoral students, my talk was packed with a lot of stuff: a reflection on my personal MOOC journey, a bibliometrics study supported by wonderful colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;http://icar.univ-lyon2.fr/membres/lund/&#34;&gt;Kris Lund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sebastian-grauwin.com/&#34;&gt;Sebastian Grauwin&lt;/a&gt; from Lyon, a brief exploration of research design, and a call for action to leverage MOOCs for societal changes in China. It was quite emotional to be on the stage, and some attendees told me they felt moved as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/lZ70KsUsRrxtu4&#34; width=&#34;595&#34; height=&#34;485&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom:5px&#34;&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/dirkchen/mapping-the-terrain-of-mooc-research&#34; title=&#34;Mapping the Terrain of MOOC Research&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mapping the Terrain of MOOC Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/dirkchen&#34;&gt;Bodong Chen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference organizers did a terrific job documenting the conference through visual note-taking (see below). The energy I experienced from these scholars was amazing! One important intention of this conference was to develop a community of MOOC practice &amp;amp; research in China. I will be looking out for great work coming from this community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/article_images/pku-mooc-forum-wall.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;asian-open-universities-learning-analytics&#34;&gt;Asian Open Universities, Learning Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the short stay in Beijing, three delegates of &lt;a href=&#34;http://dl4d.org/2016/04/seven-dl4d-research-grants-approved/&#34;&gt;our MOOC research project funded by DL4D&lt;/a&gt; flied to Manila for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://aaouconference.com/2016/index.php/en/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30th&lt;/strong&gt; Annual Conference of Asian Association of Open Universities (AAOU)&lt;/a&gt;. I was asked to deliver a Learning Analytics seminar and present in a session about Learning Analytics in HigherEd, both sponsored by DL4D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt quite uncertain heading into the seminar filled with eighty registrants, who I knew very little about. It was challenging to lead a 3-hour seminar after getting 2 hours of sleep following a late-night flight. But the seminar went really well, with main points covered and some group interactivity taking place. I also heard a number of participants referencing the seminar during the main conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enthusiasm for Learning Analytics was &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; among Asian Open Universities represented at the conference. The tricky part, though, is to combine such enthusiasm with local needs, interests and expertise, while also avoiding &amp;ldquo;pitfalls&amp;rdquo; documented elsewhere. Navigating this new field is challenging. As put by Dragan Gasevic (the current President of &lt;a href=&#34;solaresearch.org&#34;&gt;SoLAR&lt;/a&gt;) during his AAOU keynote, Learning Analytics is a field with kaleidoscopic interests and &amp;ldquo;one-size-fits-all&amp;rdquo; would never work. My later presentation (see below) built upon the seminar and Dragan&amp;rsquo;s keynote and presented cases at both institutional and classroom levels, highlighting especially ongoing Learning Analytics initiatives at the University of Minnesota. The Learning Analytics opportunities for Open Universities in Asia are endless, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://asianmoocs.org/&#34;&gt;the brand-new Asian MOOCs platform&lt;/a&gt; launched at the conference and their innate commitments to openness that would contribute to the young field in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Academic Workflow Part 2: Portability, Automation, and Openness</title>
      <link>/blog/2016-10-17-paperpile-workflow-part-2/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/1uk3/3913309568&#34;&gt;Luke Addison&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;portable-annotations-and-automation&#34;&gt;Portable Annotations and Automation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodong.ch/blog/2016/09/22/paperpile-workflow-part-1.html&#34;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I explained key elements of my academic workflow: easy capturing of references, file storage on the cloud, portable annotations produced while reading, automation, and collaborative writing at one place. I made a screencast to share my workflow involving elements of capturing, storing, and collaborative writing in Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for this post, I recorded another video focusing on elements related to &lt;em&gt;portable annotations&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;automation&lt;/em&gt; of piecing information together for later retrieval. More detailed information about the R scripts and web hosting I mentioned in the video could be found on &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodong.ch/notes/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. The workflow could be further automated and optimized when Paperpile provides public APIs, which seems &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.paperpile.com/t/public-developer-api/918&#34;&gt;possible in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;853&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPuSnxei2NI?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-workflow&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this video could offer my two cents on academic workflow. However, you may find the practice of putting notes online bizarre. That&amp;rsquo;s totally expected as safeguarding ideas and avoiding embarrassments are norms in most settings including academia. Why would one put such rough notes online anyway? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be embarrassing in case of half-baked (or pre-baked) commentaries? How they might be useful at all for other people? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be enough if I try to publish in Open Access journals or make various forms of my research &amp;ldquo;products&amp;rdquo; openly accessible? Those are all fair questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My choice of putting notes online was inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;http://reganmian.net/blog/about-me/&#34;&gt;Dr. Stian Håklev&lt;/a&gt;, a close friend of mine at OISE and a strong advocate for Open Access, Open Education, and Open Scholarship. He was one of the original co-founders of &lt;a href=&#34;http://p2pu.org/&#34;&gt;Peer2Peer University&lt;/a&gt; and studied Chinese National Top Level Courses (equivalent to MIT Courseware) for his master&amp;rsquo;s thesis. As part of his commitment to Open Access, he wrote a bunch of Ruby scripts to power &lt;a href=&#34;http://reganmian.net/wiki/doku.php&#34;&gt;a wiki-based citation management system&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to his ambition to only publish in OA journals. The idea of &lt;strong&gt;opening up the process&lt;/strong&gt; or &amp;ldquo;immature&amp;rdquo; artifacts &amp;ndash; instead of the final products (e.g., journal articles) &amp;ndash; is attractive to me, and inspired me to settle on the current workflow/practice I&amp;rsquo;m following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a while ago when I noticed a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/reread-old-notes-to-spark-new-ideas-1694783233&#34;&gt;LifeHacker article&lt;/a&gt; citing &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodong.ch/notes/2013/09/26/johnson2010.html&#34;&gt;a note I shared about Steven Johnson&amp;rsquo;s book&lt;/a&gt; while I was still manually taking notes from readings in Mendeley.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/article_images/notes-lifehacker.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the attribution link, the author of the LifeHacker article actually borrowed much information from &lt;a href=&#34;http://99u.com/workbook/40681/catch-your-swarm&#34;&gt;a post on 99U&lt;/a&gt;, which originally cited my note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/article_images/notes-9u.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information travels. I was even more surprised that the LifeHacker article has been reblogged for dozens of times, and has also been spread on social media (Google+, Twitter and alike). And I had no idea things would unfold like this at the first place of posting the notes. There are other examples that I&amp;rsquo;ll not mention here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/article_images/notes-google.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an example may sound trivial but at least points out a possible way of public engagement for academics. Can you &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/08/sociologists-discuss-how-departments-should-consider-social-media-activity-and-other&#34;&gt;tweet your way to tenure&lt;/a&gt;? Maybe not, or not too soon. But publishing the final articles in the most prestigious journals should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be the only way. More openness with various stages of the academic workflow may catalyze public engagement. As Philip Cohen, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland at College Park &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/08/sociologists-discuss-how-departments-should-consider-social-media-activity-and-other&#34;&gt;puts&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to value and reward openness in our routine work&amp;hellip; Public engagement does not need to mean separate activities and products, but can mean taking a public-facing stance in our existing work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are interested in promoting openness in academia &amp;ndash; in whatever area &amp;ndash; check out this year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://openaccessweek.org/&#34;&gt;International Open Access Week&lt;/a&gt; during October 24 - 30, 2016. Go to a local event, or engage in a conversation online.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Academic Workflow with Paperpile: Part 1</title>
      <link>/blog/2016-09-22-paperpile-workflow-part-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2016-09-22-paperpile-workflow-part-1/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;It was the beginning of this new school year when I started to &amp;ldquo;revamp&amp;rdquo; my academic workflow, which has been very digital since the dawn of my dissertation research. There are tons of articles you can find online about digital workflow for academics, e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2014/09/updated-academic-workflow-2014/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahiddendiscourse.com/blog/2013/02/17/the-cognitive-basis-for-academic-workflows/&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://hublog.hubmed.org/archives/001277.html&#34;&gt;this post involving LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;, etc. For me, there are a few essential things I want to achieve in my workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;: Easily capture references from the Web, including Google Scholar, journal webpages, and my university library, into my personal reference library. More efficient ways of importing PDF files will be sweet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage on the cloud&lt;/strong&gt;: Store both bibliographic information (i.e., metadata) and the PDF files on the cloud for ubiquitous access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read (everywhere) + portable annotations&lt;/strong&gt;: I wish to read on my Mac, iPad, and iPhone, even though I mostly read on my Mac. More importantly, I do not want my annotations to the documents to be locked in closed ecosystems (e.g., Adobe Reader, Mendeley&amp;rsquo;s PDF annotator). I want all my annotations to be portable. A fancier way to say this is to give annotations their own independent lives as conceptual artifacts open to be connected with other artifacts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation&lt;/strong&gt;: I wish to automate steps of my workflow as much as possible, while spending minimal time to engineer automation by myself. For example, I wish to piece together annotations and bibliographic information together into annotated bibliographies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative writing at one place&lt;/strong&gt;: Writing &lt;em&gt;collaboratively&lt;/em&gt; is essential to me. Writing in LaTeX does not work for me because colleagues in my field(s) typically do not use it. Writing using Markdown and Scrivener is also fine, but again, more appropriate for individual writing tasks. Writing in MS Word is a pain, especially when comments explode after a few exchanges; and that&amp;rsquo;s when it crashes on my Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this semester, I was using a pretty sophisticated workflow depending on Mendeley (for biblio capturing &amp;amp; storage), Dropbox (for storage), Skim + PDFExpert (for reading and annotation), and some R scripts (for automation). Theses tools support my efforts to &amp;lsquo;publish&amp;rsquo; some of &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodong.ch/notes/&#34;&gt;my raw notes&lt;/a&gt; online, just as an integrated component as my workflow. However, I struggled when writing collaboratively with colleagues. I was either stuck with MS Word and ended with a file name like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Or, I need to insert reference after-the-fact when writing in Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have improved after trying &lt;a href=&#34;https://paperpile.com/&#34;&gt;Paperpile&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly new tool for reference management. It comes with &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.metapdf.com/&#34;&gt;MetaPDF&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to read &amp;amp; annotate PDFs in browsers and, more importantly, exporting annotations into various formats. For storage, Paperpile integrates with Google Drive, so that your PDF files are all synced through Drive. In addition, it integrates with Google Docs through an add-on! The whole design seems very intuitive to me and reflects much thinking to make our life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a 9-min video I made for colleagues in a faculty writing group. It describes three things: (1) basic interface; (2) capturing references from the Web; and (3) inserting citations into Google Docs. More tutorials may follow&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Key Tensions in the Field of Learning Analytics</title>

&lt;p&gt;As the second iteration of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/meefen/la-spring16&#34;&gt;my Learning Analytics course&lt;/a&gt; concludes at UMN, I thought it might be a good time to reflect on various issues we&amp;rsquo;ve explored in this course and I&amp;rsquo;ve been personally reflecting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics is an emerging, highly interdisciplinary field where many disciplines&amp;ndash;such as education, computer science, and engineering&amp;ndash;intersect. Since its first significant scholarly gathering in 2011, learning analytics has been increasingly mentioned in news, technical reports, academic publications, and grant solicitations. The surge of this nascent field rests on a promise&amp;ndash;and also a &lt;em&gt;premise&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash;that digital traces of learning could be turned into actionable knowledge to promote learning and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-learning-analytics&#34;&gt;What is learning analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of learning analytics is plural and multifaceted due to the kaleidoscopic conceptions of learning and analytics introduced from various disciplines. The most widely adopted definition of learning analytics originated from its first conference: “learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs” (Long &amp;amp; Siemens, 2011, p. 34). This definition captures key components of learning analytics, which are further articulated in a conceptual model composing seven components, including collection, storage, cleaning, integration, analysis, representation, visualization, and action (Siemens, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to understanding learning analytics is to recognize what are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; learning analytics. Efforts have been made to distinguish learning analytics from its adjacent areas. Academic analytics, an area that was mostly inspired by business intelligence (Goldstein &amp;amp; Katz, 2005), have been mentioned frequently with learning analytics. In contrast to academic analytics, which is focused on institutions and administrators without much attention to pedagogy, learning analytics is more directly concerned with teachers and learners by attending to micro-patterns of learning (Long &amp;amp; Siemens, 2011). Educational Data Mining (EDM), a field that emerged a few years earlier, is also associated with learning analytics. According to Siemens (2013), while learning analytics is more concerned with sense making and action, EDM is more focused toward developing methods specifically for the exploration of data that are originated from educational settings. Although the techniques used are similar in both fields, EDM has a more defined focus on reductionist analysis (Siemens &amp;amp; Baker, 2012), while learning analytics attends more to practice (Chatti, Dyckhoff, Schroeder, &amp;amp; Thüs, 2012). Despite the distinctions, however, it is expected learning analytics, EDM and academic analytics will continue to intersect and overlap in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With learning and analytics as two pivotal concepts of the field, conceptions of learning analytics may stress one over the other. On the one hand, when a data- or analytic-centric perspective is taken, the phrase “learning analytics” often evokes images of data&amp;ndash;especially “big”, quantitative data&amp;ndash;in education. For example, the 2013 Horizon report defines learning analytics as “education’s approach to ‘big data,’ a science that was originally leveraged by businesses to analyze commercial activities, identify spending trends, and predict consumer behavior” (Johnson et al., 2013, p. 20). This emphasis on data is not surprising since the abundance of data has been recognized as a key driver of this field (Long &amp;amp; Siemens, 2011). Such a data-centric view can also be observed in conceptual models of learning analytics. For instance, a model proposed by Chatti et al. (2012) includes data collection and pre-processing, analytics and action, and post-processing as three major components of learning analytics&amp;ndash;without mentioning pedagogical contexts, sense-making, and intervention designs. This data-centric view of learning analytics is also seemingly magnified by the connection and co-evolution between learning analytics and massive open online courses (MOOCs), since MOOCs have produced “big” learning-related data and have attracted research attention from learning analytics and EDM researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, scholars argue that conceptions of learning analytics need to recognize the nuanced aspects of learning, as learning analytics is essentially about learning (Gašević, Dawson, &amp;amp; Siemens, 2015). Suthers and Verbert (2013) stressed that “research on learning analytics may vary in the degree to which it makes technical contributions, but the connection to learning should be present” (p. 2). This point is often easily neglected in practical efforts of creating learning analytics. Important arguments have been made that we need to contextualize specific analytics in its epistemological stances, pedagogy, and theories of assessment (Knight, Buckingham Shum, &amp;amp; Littleton, 2014). Rather than treating analytics as being “pedagogically neutral,” an alternative approach is to recognize the highly nuanced nature of learning analytics and bring advances in learning and analytics into coordination. Thus, despite the prominent growth of big data in recent years, premature simplification of learning analytics&amp;ndash;and over-emphasis on data especially&amp;ndash;would potentially do much “harm” to education without enough thinking about learning and education (Dringus, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, learning analytics deals with educational phenomena at multiple levels. Work in learning sciences has recognized that learning happens at multiple levels&amp;ndash;not only in individual minds, but also in small groups and larger learner communities (Stahl, 2013). For instance, collaborative knowledge building as a group phenomenon depends on contributions from individuals, but cannot be reliably inferred from individual learning (Scardamalia et al., 2012). This recognition of learning at multiple levels urges learning analytics to account for analytic levels beyond individuals, which has been favored in traditional classroom settings as well as in education regimes where accountability is the major concern (e.g., in most MOOC research). Expanding the focus from learning to a broader scope of education, Buckingham Shum (2012) differentiates macro- (region/state/national/international), meso- (institution-wide), and micro-levels (individual user or cohort) of learning analytics. Traditional scholarly analysis of learning in fields such as learning sciences has been focused on the micro-level. To assist decision making at different levels, learning analytics also need to attend to higher level educational data, as well as integration and mutual compliment among different levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the meaning of learning analytics as a term is plural and multifaceted. Work in this field could emphasize learning and/or analytics in many different ways, and at different levels. Such diverse understandings and approaches make it difficult to create a unified definition of learning analytics. Therefore, it is necessary for researchers in this field to provide operational definition of the learning analytics they employ and how they relate learning and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-tensions&#34;&gt;Key tensions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interdisciplinary, cross-level nature of learning analytics have given rise to a variety of tensions that further development in this field need to be aware of. Attending to those tensions is necessary for effective and ethical design, implementation, and use of learning analytics. Salient tensions I have observed from the literature to date include the tensions (1) among various conceptions of learning, (2) between learning and computer algorithms, (3) between agency and control, and (4) surrounding ethical access and use of educational data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;different-conceptions-of-learning&#34;&gt;Different conceptions of learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics is not only about a set of analytic techniques, but is also concerned with feeding results to relevant stakeholders to improve educational practice. On the surface level, what we consider as learning would dictate the types of data collected for the analysis “learning.” Going further, researchers may hold different epistemological assumptions&amp;ndash;about where knowledge resides and how knowledge grows&amp;ndash;and will thus consider learning drastically differently. For instance, a researcher considering learning as knowledge acquisition in individual minds is more likely to emphasize test scores as hallmarks of academic performance. In contrast, another researcher who considers knowledge as dependent on social interactions would look into group activities for indicators of learning (Buckingham Shum &amp;amp; Crick, 2012). These examples illustrates that different conceptions of learning commonly exists in many research communities of education, but the divide is even wider when educational theorists, computer scientists and engineers gather around the same table. As we go forward, any effort in creating learning analytics would require the researchers and the developers to minimally make one’s conception of learning explicit so that everyone could at least try to stay on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-and-computer-algorithms&#34;&gt;Learning and computer algorithms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics is broadly conceptualized as &amp;ldquo;translating&amp;rdquo; digital traces into numbers for interpretation. For example, it is compared to immersing a thermometer into water to gauge the temperature. Learning analytics, in this case, is considered as being “pedagogically neutral.” However, this is hardly the case when making sense of learning from learners’ “digital shadow” in learning environments (Buckingham Shum, 2015). During the process, critical decisions are made on data collection, choice of algorithms, interpretation of results, and possible courses of action from the results of LA. These decisions are laden with values and beliefs about learning. From a different perspective, any results of computer algorithms are contingent upon informed and contextualized interpretations; real changes in education cannot be brought about by simply giving people volumes of numbers through learning analytics (Macfadyen &amp;amp; Dawson, 2012). Thus, oversimplification of learning may lead to misinformed practice that neglects important aspects of learning.
Siemens (2013) cautions learning analysts to “keep human and social processes central in learning analytics activities,” as the learning process is essentially social and creative (p. 1395). A similar caution is made by Gašević et al. (2015) who have problematized practices of counting certain activities for correlation with academic performance. These researchers are calling for work around coherent theoretical models of learning behaviors. It is especially dangerous if algorithms exist in “black boxes” and produce numbers that are in the hands of those in power to influence behaviors (Buckingham Shum, 2015), in the name of “optimizing” learning. This tension between learning and algorithms will continue to figure in learning analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;agency-and-control&#34;&gt;Agency and control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Analytics influences learner’s agency when it is used to shape how learning is interpreted and how learners need to act (Buckingham Shum, 2015). So a constant tension that exists between the analytics and the learners is how much agency is taken away from the learners when analytics come into play. Analytics could disempower learners, making them increasingly reliant on institutions to provide them with continuous feedback rather than developing meta-cognitive and &amp;ldquo;learning-to-learn&amp;rdquo; skills and dispositions (Buckingham Shum &amp;amp; Ferguson, 2012). This is especially the case when analytics is contained in &amp;ldquo;black boxes&amp;rdquo; and when learners are giving results to react to without understanding how the algorithms work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addressing this tension, agency has been recognized as an important principle in designing learning analytics interventions (Wise, 2014). A special issue of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://learning-analytics.info/&#34;&gt;Journal of Learning Analytics&lt;/a&gt; to appear in 2016 would feature the application of learning analytics to promote high-order competencies. The balance between control and agency is high-stake, so that work in learning analytics will not undo decades of work in education to promote high-level agencies that are important for people in the knowledge age. In addition to facilitating administration, awareness, reflection and sense-making, learning analytics should invest in helping learners and stakeholders of learning to make local decision-making rather than taking such power away from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-access-and-ethics&#34;&gt;Data access and ethics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethics issues related to learning analytics are multi-dimensional. First, learning analytics researchers are divided on who owns the data and whether usage of certain learning platforms should incur consent of data use for analytics purposes. For instance, Macfadyen and Dawson (2012) mention that “data that is gathered through institutional research is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,” rather than traditional ethics review process for academic research. While it may be unreasonable to require researchers to obtain consent from all learners, research ethics need to be regularly evaluated even if data are already made accessible (Boyd &amp;amp; Crawford, 2012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethical issues may figure more deeply in power relations between educational institutions and stakeholders. In higher education, for instance, power relations among students and universities should be brought to bear on when designing learning analytics (Slade &amp;amp; Prinsloo, 2013), as they may lead to important consequences (e.g., graduation) for individuals. In classrooms, ethical use of learning analytics needs to consider the vulnerability of students to protect them from possible harms. For example, publicly comparing all students’ performance may undermine confidence of low performing students, while presenting one’s individual performance with a class average may de-motivate middle-high performing students who could actually invest more. The impact of power relations stretches from data collection to how analytics could get interpreted and have real-life, powerful impact on individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tensions explored so far are interconnected and should not be viewed as separate. For example, moral practice of learning analytics does not only depend on ethical use of data but also moral applications that look beyond academic “effectiveness” (Slade &amp;amp; Prinsloo, 2013). Critically exploring different conceptions of learning would lead to more sensible discussion of agency and control when designing learning analytics. Kaleidoscopic as the field is, those tensions will exist as long as there is participation from multiple disciplines. The goal is not to achieve a unified view of the field, but to create a fruitful “common ground” for further development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CanvasNet: Formative feedback for &#39;social learning&#39; on Canvas</title>

&lt;p&gt;I have been teaching an undergraduate course using &lt;a href=&#34;https://canvas.instructure.com/&#34;&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt; this semester. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how it happened because I&amp;rsquo;m essentially a disbeliever in Learning Management Systems (LMS). I believe one&amp;rsquo;s learning should not be &lt;em&gt;managed&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;LMS is the minivan of Education,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://mfeldstein.com/lms-is-the-minivan-of-education-and-other-thoughts-from-lili15/&#34;&gt;says Phil Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Even better, &amp;ldquo;the LMS is more like a bus than a minivan - someone else is driving, it only travels on a pre-arranged route, the bus is often late but you still have to be on time because it won&amp;rsquo;t wait if you miss it&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.downes.ca/post/63849&#34;&gt;says Stephen Downes&lt;/a&gt;. However, to show my mistrust in the &amp;lsquo;minivan&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;bus&amp;rsquo;, I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose to avoid it but to jump on board and &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;The LMS is the minivan of education—everyone has one and no one is proud of it&amp;#39; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PhilOnEdTech&#34;&gt;@PhilOnEdTech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/opened15?src=hash&#34;&gt;#opened15&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/gdel0oj8Pn&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gdel0oj8Pn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tom Evans (@taevans) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/taevans/status/667028440046899200&#34;&gt;November 18, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a social construtivist researcher, social interaction is a must in my teaching. Because the course I am teaching is writing-intensive, posting some text each week in the forum is an important part of course participation. As a novice (online) instructor, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find means to nurture social interaction in the forum. (Btw, regardless of &amp;lsquo;bells and whistles&amp;rsquo; of features for &lt;em&gt;management&lt;/em&gt;, the discussion forum on Canvas is unsurprisingly dully designed.) As an R tinkerer, I thought it might be neat to write some tools to provide formative feedback to my students on their social and conceptual engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social engagement&lt;/em&gt;. To help students reflect on their social engagement, social network analysis (SNA) becomes a natural choice. However, it is not always clear based on the literature which kinds of information from SNA could be helpful for students. A socigram? Network metrices? Or written interpretation of them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conceptual engagement&lt;/em&gt;. One challenge I see in my class is to bring students to become aware of each other&amp;rsquo;s contributions. Different students &amp;ndash; bringing with them different interests and experiences &amp;ndash; were discussing different things. A challenge is to present a high-level conceptual landscape of discussion hoping students could become aware of and eventually take-up things they would otherwise neglect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;canvasnet&#34;&gt;CanvasNet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these goals in mind, I put together a rough plan and designed an analytics-driven &amp;ldquo;intervention&amp;rdquo; for my class. The analytics is simple &amp;ndash; social network analytics and a wordcloud based on weekly discussions. Pedagogical design included written interpretations and encouragements that went into weekly announcements on Canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In researching means to develop the feedback tools, I stumbled upon Martin Hawksey&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mashe.hawksey.info/2013/02/lak13-recipes-in-capturing-and-analyzing-data-using-sna-on-canvas-discussions-with-nodexl-for-when-its-not-a-snapp/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on getting Canvas discussion forum into Google Spreadsheet and then exporting data for social network analysis using NodeXL. Following Martin&amp;rsquo;s recipe, it took 20 minutes to get things setup before Google Spreadsheet started to take care of data gathering and storage for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Google taking care of data, I wrote a Shiny app in R which reads data from Google, processes social interactions and posts (using the &lt;code&gt;igraph&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tm&lt;/code&gt; packages respectively), and returns two simple interactive visualizations to students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sociogram&lt;/strong&gt;. A visualization of interaction network among students. The teacher is hidden by default, mainly because the design of Canvas (and LMS in general) implicitly suggests all discussions originate from the teacher. Students could identify themselves and explore who they are talking with by interacting with the sociogram. Some simple social network metrics, e.g., degrees and density, are provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/canvasnet-sociogram.png&#34; alt=&#34;example figures here&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A wordcloud&lt;/strong&gt;. A wordcould visualizing most frequent words used in discussion (in the past two weeks by default). Further feedback is provided that highlights frequent terms the current student has and has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; engaged with so far. In addition, the number of words to display and the frequency threshold could be adjusted. One could also click on a word to find out its frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/canvasnet-wordcloud.png&#34; alt=&#34;example figures here&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data collection is ongoing. Student beliefs in &amp;lsquo;social learning&amp;rsquo; have been collected through a questionnaire. Online focus groups were conducted to explore students&amp;rsquo; experience of social interactions in this course. We will interview some students to understand the usefulness of this tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intuition is the current version of this tool will NOT work for a variety of reasons. The lack of dialogues around this tool is one possible factor. The habit of learning as individuals is another contributor. Lessons learned will be used to inform the next design cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;calling-the-canvas-api-from-r&#34;&gt;Calling the Canvas API from R&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supposing we need to remove the dependency on Google Spreadsheets, calling the Canvas API directly from R is also quite straightforward. Below is a (sort of) minimal example to play with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(RCurl)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)

#################################
## Functions
#################################

CreateCurlHandle &amp;lt;- function() {
  ### Create a curl handle that will be shared among API calls

  library(RCurl)
  curl = getCurlHandle()
  curlSetOpt(cookiejar = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;,
             followlocation = TRUE,
             curl = curl) # do not need to read the cookies
  return(curl)
}

CleanJSONText = function(text) {
  ## Clean json text that might cause lexical error when parsing

  text = gsub(&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;, &amp;quot; &amp;quot;, text)
  text = gsub(&amp;quot;\t&amp;quot;, &amp;quot; &amp;quot;, text)
  text = gsub(&amp;quot;\\\\&amp;lt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;lt;&amp;quot;, text)
  text = gsub(&amp;quot;&amp;lt;img.*?&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, text) # get rid of images
  text = gsub(&amp;quot;\r&amp;quot;, &amp;quot; &amp;quot;, text)
  return(text)
}

#################################

## Baseurl and access token
baseUrl = &amp;quot;https://YOUR_HOST.instructure.com/api/v1/courses&amp;quot;
token = &amp;quot;YOUR_CANVAS_TOKEN&amp;quot;

curl = CreateCurlHandle()

## Authenticate
auth = tbl_df(fromJSON(
  getForm(baseUrl, access_token = token, curl=curl),
  flatten = TRUE
))
glimpse(auth)

## Pick a course
courseUrl = paste0(baseUrl, &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;, YOUR_COURSE_NUMBER)

## Retrieve all topics
topicsUrl = paste0(courseUrl, &amp;quot;/discussion_topics&amp;quot;)
json = getForm(topicsUrl,
               .opts = list(httpheader = c(Authorization=paste(&amp;quot;Bearer&amp;quot;, token))),
               # access_token = token,
               curl=curl)
topics = tbl_df(fromJSON(CleanJSONText(json), flatten = TRUE))
data.frame(topics %&amp;gt;% select(id, title, url))

## Pick one topic, and get the full topic
topicUrl = paste0(topicsUrl, &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;, topics$id[4], &amp;quot;/view&amp;quot;)
json = getForm(topicUrl,
               access_token = token,
               curl=curl)
topic = fromJSON(CleanJSONText(json), flatten = TRUE)
participants = topic$participants
posts = topic$view
replies = do.call(&amp;quot;rbind&amp;quot;, posts$replies)
# from replies social network could then be analyzed ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post mainly reports on a technological effort to develop a simple feedback tool for online discussion on Canvas. The current design is to harness Canvas data using Google Spreadsheet and then visualize data using an R Shiny app. Reading data directly from Canvas could be an option in future design and development. The efficacy of the simple prototype remain unclear and likely to be challenged. Tons of issues need to be further explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching was a thing that I was least sure about when taking on my position at The U. People talk about how little training on grant writing one gets as a PhD student. For me, teaching was probably more neglected while doing my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I was not short of ideas for teaching because I had encountered so many great teachers in my life and I happen to also research teaching and learning. So when designing my first course at The U&amp;mdash;an introductory course on Learning Analytics&amp;mdash;I weaved in a few ideas that I thought would be always important for my philosophy of teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;community-and-group-work&#34;&gt;Community and group work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years of researching &lt;em&gt;knowledge building&lt;/em&gt; in elementary schools has transformed my views on teaching and learning. The key idea of the knowledge building approach is to have students collectively taking &lt;em&gt;responsibility&lt;/em&gt; in advancing their &lt;em&gt;community knowledge&lt;/em&gt; through &lt;em&gt;discourse&lt;/em&gt;. So knowledge building emphasize communal discourse, going very far to claim that &amp;ldquo;the state of public knowledge in a community only exists in the discourse of that community, the progress of knowledge just is the progress of knowledge-building discourse&amp;rdquo; (Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 2006, in Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kf.utoronto.ca:8080/kforum&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Forum&lt;/strong&gt; (v5)&lt;/a&gt; was used to support week-basd communal discourse. I didn&amp;rsquo;t require students to contribute a certain number of posts each week. Student contributions were not counted towards grades unless one didn&amp;rsquo;t contribute at all. Students were encouraged to expose their thinking (however immature) and provide constructive criticism to their peers. (I also hoped to use Knowledge Forum as an idea archive so that students could have access to their ideas in later phase of the course and make attempts to weave them together in the end. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t work as well as wished.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I set up two types of groups to help students assuming more responsibility in this course: (1) &lt;strong&gt;Special Interest Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;each student voluntarily signed up for one topic in the course and became responsible for leading the whole class learning this topic with her group mates, and (2) &lt;strong&gt;Working Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;students self-organized into groups to tackle real-world learning analytics problems and worked towards tentative solutions as final projects of this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a beginner teacher, I sometimes felt the urge to lecture my students, because that lecturing usually means more &amp;ldquo;certainty&amp;rdquo; for the teacher. I tried hard to resist this temptation, letting students counting on each other&amp;mdash;essentially functioning as a community. In this course, letting students taking more responsibility produced better experience than having myself delivering lectures. Some &lt;em&gt;Special Interest Groups&lt;/em&gt; designed great materials and activities which I could never come up with&amp;mdash;partly because, I admit wholeheartedly, they&amp;rsquo;re much better teachers than me. Not only more diverse voices became represented in the course, my understanding of learning analytics had also been transformed by student voices during this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Great jigsaw activity this week designed by SIG 3 leaders Tiffany &amp;amp; Jennifer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/LAUMN?src=hash&#34;&gt;#LAUMN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/learninganalytics?src=hash&#34;&gt;#learninganalytics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/tdh9uCwp44&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tdh9uCwp44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bodong Chen (@bodong_c) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bodong_c/status/583779767758884864&#34;&gt;April 2, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;openness&#34;&gt;Openness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three aspects when it comes to openness in my teaching. The first is &lt;strong&gt;openness with content&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers are generally doing a poor job opening their scholarly processes, for a variety of reasons, good or bad. I condemn this reality (see my tweet below). It&amp;rsquo;s probably the same for teaching, despite the trends of open educational resources, open education, and MOOC. Because I had (and still have) my best intention to offer the course again in the future, I treated my course materials as &amp;ldquo;objects&amp;rdquo; subject to continual refinement by myself and the world&amp;mdash;sort of like open-source computer programs. So I hosted all course materials on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/meefen/LA-UMN&#34;&gt;a Github repository&lt;/a&gt;, rather than putting them in my secrete computer or the secular course management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;It always sucks when you try to track a tool/software mentioned in a paper, and what you get is this page. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/academics?src=hash&#34;&gt;#academics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/azhCaQadJz&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/azhCaQadJz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bodong Chen (@bodong_c) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bodong_c/status/531834500620517376&#34;&gt;November 10, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect is &lt;strong&gt;openness with web spaces&lt;/strong&gt;. I encouraged students to tweet using the &lt;code&gt;#LAUMN&lt;/code&gt; hashtag. I also created &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netvibes.com/laumn#General&#34;&gt;a Netvibes channel for the course&lt;/a&gt;, which aggregated posts from Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and selected blog posts. I also aggregated tweets from the &lt;code&gt;#learninganalytics&lt;/code&gt; hashtag in the Netvibes dashboard to help nurturing a sense of connecting with the broader community, which I will further discuss below. A student initiated &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/105833645291967441690&#34;&gt;a Google+ community&lt;/a&gt; for this course as well. Fostering openness with web spaces grants students choices of which venues to interact with (even though they&amp;rsquo;re still required to use Knowledge Forum), and enriches their professional growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Playing w/social network analysis in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/UMNLA?src=hash&#34;&gt;#UMNLA&lt;/a&gt; w/ &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Gephi&#34;&gt;@Gephi&lt;/a&gt; to analyze my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/facebook&#34;&gt;@facebook&lt;/a&gt; friends &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bodong_c&#34;&gt;@bodong_c&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/miniyhc&#34;&gt;@miniyhc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FanOuyang&#34;&gt;@FanOuyang&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/EoqznB7Kyq&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/EoqznB7Kyq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Lana Peterson (@tyLanasaurusrex) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tyLanasaurusrex/status/581259528701886464&#34;&gt;March 27, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third aspect was &lt;strong&gt;openness with &amp;ldquo;outer&amp;rdquo; communities&lt;/strong&gt;. As mentioned above, students were encouraged to become connected with updates from the learning analytics community. I invited a few guest speakers to talk with us virtually or F2F. A group of us even went to a data science event together in March. I believe teaching at all levels&amp;mdash;even in elementary grades&amp;mdash;should adopt this mindset, not downgrading learning to an inferior version of what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the &amp;ldquo;real-world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/LAUMN?src=hash&#34;&gt;#LAUMN&lt;/a&gt; class moved to this fancy lobby on a lovely Saturday morning &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bodong_c&#34;&gt;@bodong_c&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/miniyhc&#34;&gt;@miniyhc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/xBvpo2rHCV&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/xBvpo2rHCV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Fan Ouyang (@FanOuyang) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FanOuyang/status/574227218991308800&#34;&gt;March 7, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;adaptivity&#34;&gt;Adaptivity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been constantly revising my syllabus all through the semester. I changed readings based on my perception of students&amp;rsquo; prior knowledge, even though it was difficult for a class of grad students with diverse backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course was generally successful, based on reviews I got from students. Of course, it was also probably because they are all nice&amp;mdash;because (1) they&amp;rsquo;re really nice, and (2) we are in Minnesota :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the general success, I also learned many lessons. Students were very tolerant of my teaching. I wish to do a better job in facilitating F2F discussion so that everyone would have better chance to talk. I wish to spend more efforts to encourage international students to speak out in class meetings. I hope to set up a more effective introduction at the beginning of the course so that students would feel more confident. I would provide clearer description of evaluation criteria (even though I believe grades are the last things you would care in grad school). I would also need to think hard on the dilemma of having discourse taking place at different venues of students&amp;rsquo; choices (e.g., Twitter and Google+) and the need for a strong, coherent discourse for all. I&amp;rsquo;m working towards addressing these issues when this course is offered again in Spring 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, isn&amp;rsquo;t nice to get a photo of myself put together with plain text by a student? After all, it was a blast to teach a talented and energetic group of students in my first semester at The U.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Ethan, a student in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/LAUMN?src=hash&#34;&gt;#LAUMN&lt;/a&gt; class, used pure text to create an image of me endorsing &amp;quot;the power of pure text.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/fun?src=hash&#34;&gt;#fun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/uMlf0wcoHW&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uMlf0wcoHW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bodong Chen (@bodong_c) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bodong_c/status/575698517919940609&#34;&gt;March 11, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since my last post, thanks to the &amp;ldquo;madness&amp;rdquo; of travel and other affairs near the end of my first semester at The U. From March, I attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://lak15.solaresearch.org/&#34;&gt;LAK&lt;/a&gt; in Poughkeepsie NY, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aera.net/EventsMeetings/AnnualMeeting/PreviousAnnualMeetings/2015AnnualMeeting/tabid/15930/Default.aspx&#34;&gt;AERA&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/bcc-educational-discourse-workshop/&#34;&gt;an educational discourse workshop&lt;/a&gt; in Ann Arbor, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isls.org/cscl2015/&#34;&gt;CSCL&lt;/a&gt; in Gothenburg, Sweden. Before CSCL, I visited several cities in China, including Beijing where I talked with a group of talented grad students at Peking University and chatted in length with a colleague at Beijing Normal University; after CSCL, I visited a colleague &amp;amp; friend in Oslo and enjoyed a wonderful &amp;ldquo;Norway in a Nutshell&amp;rdquo; fjord trip. This has been a &amp;ldquo;round&amp;rdquo; trip&amp;mdash;both because I traveled in a circle around the globe before and after CSCL, and also because it was my returning visit to Peking U and Beijing Normal where I studied for seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/10989250_10155642288015335_8306175952770482905_o.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fjord&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trip-to-china&#34;&gt;Trip to China&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes abound in Chinese universities nowadays. Changes do not only happen with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/chinese-colleges-are-trying-to-look-like-the-ivy-league/379997/&#34;&gt;the look of their campuses&lt;/a&gt;, but also more deeply with efforts to establish themselves internationally. Beijing Normal, which houses the top-ranked education and psychology faculties in China, has been aggressive in recruiting international scholars. They have been sending delegates to AERA every year since 2012, as far as I know, with an important goal of recruiting prospective faculty members from abroad. According to anecdotes I heard, the faculty of education&amp;rsquo;s goal is to have 30% of its faculty members coming originally from foreign countries. While it remains debatable whether this is the right strategy to build an international faculty, and it&amp;rsquo;s still unclear how foreign scholars would fit into the Chinese system, the effort to diversify their talents is evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides recruitment, from talking with colleagues from both Peking U and Beijing Normal, the word &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo; has become more important than ever in their institutional visions and agendas. Nationally, a policy that prohibited faculty from creating start-ups was removed quite recently. At Beijing Normal specifically, institution-level funds are in abundance to support faculty wishing to explore &amp;ldquo;innovative ideas.&amp;rdquo; The area of educational technology is especially vibrant because its close connections with ventures and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, together with the strong emphasis on research-based innovation grows their capacity to conduct educational research. Training in methodology&amp;mdash;from both my prior experience as a student and exchanges with scholars having connections in China&amp;mdash;has been one area of weakness that undermines the quality of academic work in China, at least for research areas I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with. However, from my exchanges with grad students at Peking U, the gap is becoming seemingly narrower. Their insights into scholarly research and awareness of the frontiers of international communities were impressive. This could be attributed to (1) increased opportunities to participate in research projects (being MOOCs, science learning or teacher education) compared to my time of being a master&amp;rsquo;s student there; and (2) exposure to international research (many of them already had experience attending international conferences abroad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the trip to China has been an eye-opening trip for me since three years ago, and I look forward to going back and spending some time there soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trip-to-cscl&#34;&gt;Trip to CSCL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My third attendance to CSCL was wonderful. The Early Career Workshop provided me ample opportunities to connect with an awesome group of mentors and young scholars. I especially enjoyed talking with them about crafting research programs. Knowing from the mentors about their different approaches of establishing their work was super helpful. Being reminded of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.isls.org/icls/2012/downloads/K1Kolodner.pdf&#34;&gt;significance criteria&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; of research was very critical. Being exposed to excitements and struggles of my peers was also beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/11313010_10105823243235739_3638208025242947098_o.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dinner with workshop colleagues&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main conference was also great&amp;mdash;as always. Besides all the wonderful research I listened to and talked about, to me the notion of &lt;strong&gt;crossing communities&lt;/strong&gt; was a big thing this year. It was a lovely &amp;ldquo;surprise&amp;rdquo; to see more Learning Analytics (LA) folks this year. Besides colleagues who have been already heavily involved in both CSCL and LA, I bumped into George Siemens and Dragan Gašević (the new president of SoLAR). When I first found George and Dragan in a &amp;ldquo;corner,&amp;rdquo; George exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;OMG, I seems to know nobody here!&amp;rdquo; But I guess it became untrue after a few hours (if not minutes) when a session on learning analytics was fully packed and connections between CSCL and LA were explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Cross-communities, cross-theories, cross-stances” (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tophe&#34;&gt;@tophe&lt;/a&gt; ’s words yesterday) happening at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/learninganalytics?src=hash&#34;&gt;#learninganalytics&lt;/a&gt; session at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSCL2015?src=hash&#34;&gt;#CSCL2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bodong Chen (@bodong_c) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bodong_c/status/608608325194928128&#34;&gt;June 10, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day later during a presidential session, leaders from a number of academic organizations representing different regions and different (yet connected) fields presented their thoughts on &amp;ldquo;grand challenges&amp;rdquo; of technology-enhanced learning. While I saw amazingly divided intentions in different fields to &lt;em&gt;optimize individual learning&lt;/em&gt; vs. to &lt;em&gt;localize decision-making by learners&lt;/em&gt;, a great level of connectedness was also evident. According to Chris Hoadley, we are all concerned with key issues such as (1) addressing scale and systems in learning (e.g., at different levels), (2) empiricism in a cyber-enabled society (e.g., efforts to model learner states, trajectories, and prcess), and (3) understanding context and contingency of learning. Different visions of grand challenges perceived by different fields are extremely valuable, while continual efforts to cross communities, or in Carolyn Rose&amp;rsquo;s words to build a &amp;ldquo;cross community transactive memory system,&amp;rdquo; will also be critical going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Building research was also well presented at CSCL. It was great to meet Knowledge Building colleagues from Canada, US, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, and Finland. My presentation on vocabulary development in Knowledge Building&amp;mdash;in collaboration with Leanne, Yoshiaki and Marlene&amp;mdash;could be found below. We were thrilled to learn that &lt;a href=&#34;http://meefen.github.io/public/files/Chen_CSCL15_Vocabulary_Longitudinal.pdf&#34;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt; was one of the five Best Paper Award nominees this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the &amp;ldquo;round-trip,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s time to enjoy my first summer in Minnesota, as well as to reflect on my first semester at The U and to &lt;strong&gt;write&lt;/strong&gt;. The next post will be on the Learning Analytics course I taught last Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/%27Out_Of_Order%27_by_David_Mach_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1102588.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/%27Out_Of_Order%27_by_David_Mach_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1102588.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Out of Order&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;blog/2014/04/17/temporailty-in-dialogues/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I highlighted the significance of studying temporality in collaborative learning and argued it should be studied more widely in learning sciences research because temporality matters for learning in a socio-cultural context. In the specific study I &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/bodong/lak14&#34;&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://lak14indy.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;LAK14&lt;/a&gt;, an analytic technique named &lt;strong&gt;Lag-sequential Analysis (LsA)&lt;/strong&gt; was applied to investigate sequential patterns among six &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259178463_Ways_of_Contributing_to_an_Explanation-Seeking_Dialogue_in_Science_and_History&#34;&gt;contribution types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in knowledge building dialogues by elementary school students. Such analysis was able to uncover temporal patterns that were otherwise undiscoverable using a traditional &amp;ldquo;coding-and-counting&amp;rdquo; technique, which is widely applied in many learning sciences studies. More methodological guidance is needed for the research community to make such technique accessible for more learning scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on when working on a MOOC research project at the University of Toronto, I got acquainted to another data mining technique named &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_Pattern_Mining&#34;&gt;Sequential Pattern Mining&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Sequence_Mining/SPADE&#34;&gt;Frequent Sequence Mining &lt;/a&gt; (FSM)&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a well-studied sub-domain of Frequent Pattern Mining. In a nutshell,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequent Sequence Mining is used to discover a set of patterns shared among objects which have between them a specific order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my specific research context, because &lt;a href=&#34;http://ikit.org/kb.html&#34;&gt;knowledge building&lt;/a&gt; is conceptualized as an emergent process in which a community of people collectively improve their ideas by making various types of contributions to their discourse, the major question I was interested in was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to which extent do the sequential relations among different contribution types matter for effective knowledge-building dialogues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it became perfectly straightforward to apply FSM to the problem I was studying, with a hope that it could afford additional insights about temporality in knowledge-building dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-preparation-for-fsm&#34;&gt;Data preparation for FSM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I had two types of knowledge-building dialogues or conceptual &lt;strong&gt;threads&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; (or productive) and &lt;em&gt;improvable&lt;/em&gt;. The first six rows of the thread data looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
&amp;gt; head(dft[, c(1, 3)])
                        thread type
1        HOW ARE ROCKS FORMED?    e
2 ROCK COMPOSITION AND TEXTURE    e
3                      FOSSILS    i
4                ROCKS COLOURS    e
5            Beginning of life    i
6 The creation of the universe    e
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;strong&gt;note&lt;/strong&gt; (aka. post) in each thread was coded into six &lt;em&gt;contribution types&lt;/em&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;questioning&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;theorizing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;obtaining information&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;working with information&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;making synthesis and analogies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;supporting discussion&lt;/em&gt;. Notes, after being coded, looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
&amp;gt; head(dfc[, c(2, 4, 5)])
                 thread noteid coding
1 HOW ARE ROCKS FORMED?      1      Q
2 HOW ARE ROCKS FORMED?      4      Q
3 HOW ARE ROCKS FORMED?      6      Q
4 HOW ARE ROCKS FORMED?      7      T
5 HOW ARE ROCKS FORMED?      9      T
6 HOW ARE ROCKS FORMED?     12     WE
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conduct FSM, a little bit of data transformation was needed to reorganize data into the following form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
&amp;gt; head(dfc_e) # effective threads
    sequenceID eventID size items
460          1  100460    1     Q
461          1  100461    1     Q
462          1  100462    1     T
463          1  100463    1    WE
464          1  100464    1     T
465          1  100465    1     T
&amp;gt; head(dfc_i) # improvable threads
   sequenceID eventID size items
89          2  200089    1     Q
90          2  200090    1     T
91          2  200091    1     T
92          2  200092    1     Q
93          2  200093    1     T
94          2  200094    1    OE
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;improvable&lt;/em&gt; threads were partitioned into two separate tables with a same structure. To conform with the requirements of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arulesSequences/index.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;arulesSequences&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; R package I was using, a thread was named a &lt;code&gt;sequence&lt;/code&gt;, notes within it were represented as &lt;code&gt;events&lt;/code&gt;, and coded contributions within a note were &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-fsm-on-knowledge-building-dialogues&#34;&gt;Running FSM on knowledge-building dialogues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After data were organized in this proper format, it became fairly easy to run FSM on each data partition using &lt;code&gt;arulesSequences&lt;/code&gt;. There were a few parameters I could tweak to make the mining more meaningful for my specific research context (see code below). For instance, &lt;code&gt;maxgap&lt;/code&gt; was (arbitrarily) set to 2, so two events with more than 2 events in between will not be captured in a sequence. Also, &lt;code&gt;maxlen&lt;/code&gt; was set to 4, so sequences with more than 4 events will not be picked up. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#Useful_Concepts&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;support&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was 0.1, so the analysis will pick up sequences that appear in at least 10% of a specific type of threads. More detailed explanation of these parameters could be found in arulesSequences&amp;rsquo; documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
library(arulesSequences)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;read-baskets&#34;&gt;read baskets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bskt &amp;lt;- read_baskets(file, info=c(&amp;ldquo;sequenceID&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;eventID&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;SIZE&amp;rdquo;))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;mine-frequent-sequences&#34;&gt;mine frequent sequences&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fs &amp;lt;- cspade(bskt, parameter = list(support = 0.1, maxlen = 4, maxgap = 2), control = list(verbose = TRUE, bfstype=TRUE))
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After frequent sequences were identified for each type of threads, I was able to compare them to inspect whether there were sequences frequent for one type of threads but not for the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-event sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started from comparing single-event sequences, i.e., single contribution types. Comparison of single-event sequences did not find any substantial difference between two types of threads. Apparently, &lt;em&gt;supporting discussion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;working with evidence&lt;/em&gt; happened more frequently in effective threads, but only for a bit more than 6% percent. Improvable threads had more frequent &lt;em&gt;making synthesis and analogies&lt;/em&gt; contributions, and the difference was 11%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
&amp;gt; Differentiate(fs_single_pretty, basket_files, 0.05)
  sequence effective improvable   diff
3    &amp;lt;{S}&amp;gt;      0.81       0.74  0.070
6   &amp;lt;{WE}&amp;gt;      0.48       0.42  0.063
4   &amp;lt;{SY}&amp;gt;      0.26       0.37 -0.110
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results to some extent triangulated with my LAK paper&amp;rsquo;s finding that two types of threads did not significantly differ in percentages of contribution types, even though FSM only counted each contribution type&amp;rsquo;s appearance only once and basic descriptive analysis could count multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-event sequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing sequences with multiple events were expected to be more interesting. Here, I improved the &lt;code&gt;support&lt;/code&gt; difference threshold to 20%. Results are presented below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
&amp;gt; Differentiate(fs_multi_pretty, basket_files, 0.2)
              sequence effective improvable  diff
90   &amp;lt;{T},{T},{T},{T}&amp;gt;     0.839       0.42  0.42

282      &amp;lt;{T},{S},{Q}&amp;gt;     0.484       0.21  0.27
87   &amp;lt;{Q},{T},{T},{T}&amp;gt;     0.903       0.63  0.27
159 &amp;lt;{T},{T},{OE},{T}&amp;gt;     0.419       0.16  0.26

201  &amp;lt;{T},{T},{T},{S}&amp;gt;     0.548       0.32  0.23
81   &amp;lt;{T},{S},{T},{T}&amp;gt;     0.387       0.16  0.23
105  &amp;lt;{T},{Q},{S},{T}&amp;gt;     0.387       0.16  0.23
311        &amp;lt;{OE},{OE}&amp;gt;     0.387       0.16  0.23
65      &amp;lt;{OE},{T},{T}&amp;gt;     0.645       0.42  0.22
125      &amp;lt;{Q},{Q},{T}&amp;gt;     0.645       0.42  0.22
25  &amp;lt;{T},{T},{T},{WE}&amp;gt;     0.323       0.11  0.22
21      &amp;lt;{T},{T},{WE}&amp;gt;     0.419       0.21  0.21
74   &amp;lt;{S},{Q},{T},{T}&amp;gt;     0.419       0.21  0.21
79   &amp;lt;{Q},{S},{T},{T}&amp;gt;     0.419       0.21  0.21
133  &amp;lt;{T},{S},{Q},{T}&amp;gt;     0.419       0.21  0.21
240          &amp;lt;{Q},{Q}&amp;gt;     0.677       0.47  0.20
205     &amp;lt;{OE},{S},{S}&amp;gt;     0.097       0.32 -0.22
211  &amp;lt;{T},{S},{S},{S}&amp;gt;     0.097       0.32 -0.22
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, in &lt;strong&gt;improvable threads&lt;/strong&gt;, students more frequently responded to &lt;em&gt;obtaining evidence&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;theorizing&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;supporting discussion&lt;/em&gt;, which was mostly about &lt;em&gt;giving opinion&lt;/em&gt; on a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;effective threads&lt;/strong&gt;, students had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more sustained &lt;em&gt;theorizing&lt;/em&gt;, represented by several frequent sequences involving multiple &lt;code&gt;{T}&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more integrated use of evidence/information, represented by several frequent transitions between &lt;code&gt;{T}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{OE}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{WE}&lt;/code&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;{T},{T},{OE},{T}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;{OE},{T},{T}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;{T},{T},{T},{WE}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more frequent attempts to problematize proposed theories, represented by &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Q&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, as well as to propose explanations to solve problems, shown by transitions from &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Q&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results were consistent with what was found in the LAK paper using LsA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective dialogues require students to work more constructively with resources, engage in increasingly deepened questioning and theorizing, and problematize proposed explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparing-fsm-with-lsa&#34;&gt;Comparing FSM with LsA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this experimentation, FSM and LsA arrived at similar results. However, there are noticeable differences. First of all, the underlying algorithms of them are quite different. While LsA relies on more basic matrix computation, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Sequence_Mining/SPADE#Algorithm&#34;&gt;SPADE&lt;/a&gt; algorithm implemented in &lt;code&gt;arulesSequences&lt;/code&gt; was basically a process of searching and counting frequent sequences. In a sense, FSM is more flexible in picking up sequential patterns because it could tolerant event &lt;code&gt;gap&lt;/code&gt; to be within a range, whereas LsA (at the version I used) could only configure &lt;code&gt;lag&lt;/code&gt; to a specific value (e.g., 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, because of the differences in computation, the results are also quite different. LsA could do significance tests, providing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; values many researchers would like. In contrast, FSM produces values of &lt;code&gt;support&lt;/code&gt; which can be compared among groups. It could also induce &lt;em&gt;association rules&lt;/em&gt; from frequent sequences, to provide most sophisticated &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#Useful_Concepts&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;interestingness&lt;/em&gt; measures&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;confidence&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt;, for additional comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As two analytic techniques, both FSM and LsA focus on sequentiality of events so could be applied to study the temporal aspect of learning phenomena. My code for FSM is shared as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/meefen/7454d2fc8b9bc821c12a&#34;&gt;Github gist&lt;/a&gt;. Please feel free to tweak it to work with your own data. Since I am also learning FSM, corrections and comments are more than welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards A Longitudinal Understanding of the Growth of Productive Vocabulary in Knowledge Building</title>

      <description>
        

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My theory is that it&amp;rsquo;s all about &lt;em&gt;gravity&lt;/em&gt;. The groundwater stays down by gravity!&amp;rdquo; (Grade one, Water unit)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because the plane is so big and heavy it is hard to reduce &lt;em&gt;gravity&lt;/em&gt; because &lt;em&gt;gravity&lt;/em&gt; can be taken away better if there are lighter, stronger materials.&amp;rdquo; (Grade two, Flight unit)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How does &lt;em&gt;gravity&lt;/em&gt; work? Is it a force in the ground that pulls you down or something in the air that pushes you down?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I think &lt;em&gt;gravity&lt;/em&gt; comes from the core of the Earth or the core of other planets.&amp;rdquo; (Grade &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Astronomy unit)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students write, and LOVE to write, in collaborative knowledge building. These excerpts about &lt;em&gt;gravity&lt;/em&gt; above are from writing of a student cohort when they progressed from Grade 1 to 6. They appear to be naturally engaged with vocabularies &amp;ndash; as well as their related scientific concepts &amp;ndash; when striving to explain all sorts of phenomena they were trying to understand. However naive their understanding was, they were able to incorporate vocabularies productively (for communicating ideas) in their writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explicit vocabulary instruction&lt;/strong&gt;, which emphasizes teaching new vocabulary through dictionary definitions and spelling lists, has been traditionally embraced by classrooms around the world. However, evidence shows that explicit vocabulary instruction leads to a decontextualized understanding of words. Rather than explicitly instructing vocabulary, people have been arguing for learning new words through emergent use in authentic contexts to support a more holistic understanding of them. A &lt;strong&gt;social-pragmatic&lt;/strong&gt; view of language development has been proposed, which argues that language acquisition is driven by social interaction and the child’s need to connect with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of vocabulary development present in knowledge building embraces such a view &amp;ndash; by immersing students in a literate environment extensible to the broader world on the Internet and beyond, in which they advance understanding collectively by building and improving explanations together. The Knowledge Building proposition is that immersion in complex literate worlds from early ages of schooling will lead to advances in both basic and advanced competencies. In knowledge building, students write frequently in Knowledge Forum, an online space for them to communicate ideas. However, little research has done to understand vocabulary development in knowledge building, especially from a longitudinal angle (not surprising given longitudinal work is so rare in CSCL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study put together by me and colleagues, to be presented at CSCL2015 in Sweden, started to attend to this gap. By tracking writing by a cohort of students over 6 years, we were trying to construct the picture of their productive vocabulary growth in knowledge building. Below are some results in and not in the CSCL paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;students-write-read-and-make-edits&#34;&gt;Students Write, Read, and Make Edits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing, reading and revising activities were happening over the course of six years. There was a trend of increase during the first four years but activities dropped in Grade 5 and 6. This was not surprising because as students get older, a lot of their writing normally happens outside of Knowledge Forum (especially in busy graduation seasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/longitudinal-productive-vocabulary-table.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly either, the total number of words produced by each student in a year was positively correlated with the frequencies of their reading, writing, and revising activities. The more students use Knowledge Forum, the more words they produce. It makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/longitudinal-productive-vocabulary-corr.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;students-wrote-more-complex-words&#34;&gt;Students Wrote More Complex Words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More interesting things started to emerge when looking at student writing more closely. We used a measure called &lt;em&gt;P_Lex&lt;/em&gt; to measure the extent to which students use more advanced vocabulary in their writing. Four levels of vocabulary &amp;ndash; drawn from Laufer and Nation&amp;rsquo;s (1995) work &amp;ndash; were distinguished in the analysis of student writing: first 1000 word families, second 1000 word families, the Academic Word List, and words beyond these three lists. A &lt;em&gt;higher P_Lex score&lt;/em&gt; of a piece of text basically means &lt;em&gt;more higher-level words&lt;/em&gt; are present in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trend analysis identified a significant trend of increase, even though P_Lex dropped in later grades (probably because of the decrease of writing activities in Grade &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). Surprisingly, reading activities, not writing, was identified as the strongest predictor of the P_Lex score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/longitudinal-productive-vocabulary-plex.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;different-levels-of-words-grew-at-varied-speed-in-different-years&#34;&gt;Different Levels of Words Grew at Varied Speed in Different Years&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tracing each student’s acquisition of words in these four lists in each year, we found the growth of word types from four lists were uneven. Noticeably, the growth of the first 1,000 words peaked in Grade 1 (from 0 to approximately 80 on average), whereas the Academic words and words out of the lists grew more rapidly in Grade 5 and 6 (even though students wrote less).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/longitudinal-productive-vocabulary-growth-rate.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional correlation analysis indicated that students who wrote and read more in Knowledge Forum were likely to demonstrate greater growth in productive vocabulary. Interestingly, in this case note modification appeared to be the most significant predictor for vocabulary growth &amp;ndash; more strongly correlated with the growth rate of vocabulary (r = .35, p &amp;lt; .001) when compared with the other two KB measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;caveats-and-thoughts&#34;&gt;Caveats and Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study highlighted some potential linkages between knowledge building and vocabulary growth. However, there has been some caveats with the current analysis. First of all, we had challenges with tracking students across years. One of the things was some students switched to schools at some point and some others joined. Also, we could not give enough consideration to different teaching styles and sociocultural dynamics in different years. Another challenge was to attribute this challenge to knowledge building; even though there were significant correlations between vocabulary growth and knowledge building activities, it remains hard to distinguish them from &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; growth of students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible direction to take is to align multiple cohorts of students together so that comparisons could be made within a same grade (same teacher, different cohorts). It would also be fun to explore possible learning analytics to help students collectively develop lexicons. The following (intricate) graph shows the use of Academic words (y axis) by students (x axis) in each year (divided by the vertical green line). While it is clear that most students are comfortable with using some words, e.g., &amp;ldquo;theory&amp;rdquo;, it is also evident that different students have demonstrated better access to different words. Can we build tools to capture the appearance of some &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; words within a student community and engage students in talking about them in a meaningful context of knowledge building? It would be fun to help students &amp;ldquo;light up&amp;rdquo; the grey areas &amp;ndash; not though explicit instruction but exchanges among themselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/longitudinal-productive-vocabulary-academic.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-wired-thing&#34;&gt;A Wired Thing&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing really relevant &amp;ndash; but I was bored enough to map out the locations of notes in Knowledge Forum. For those who are not familiar with Knowledge Forum, it provides a 2D space, called &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt;, to place and organize &lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt; in meaningful ways, normally starting from the upper-left corner of a screen. It was not surprising most notes sat in the area within 0 - 1000 pixels in both x and y axises. But it was surprising some notes appeared in the far upper-left corner. I guess we can probably go treasure hunt in Knowledge Forum some time :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My First Course: Learning Analytics in the Knowledge Age</title>

&lt;p&gt;There has been tons of learning going on for me after moving to Minnesota two months ago: getting used to the imperial unit system; finding out it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to purchase alcohol on Sundays; realizing we need to &amp;ldquo;import&amp;rdquo; our car; people actually can fly kites on lakes; and, of course, people don&amp;rsquo;t have the accent as in the movie &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt; :)&amp;hellip; It has been an amazing experience so far to get accustomed to MPLS (I am not saying &amp;ldquo;Twin Cities&amp;rdquo; because local Minnesotans prefer MPLS &amp;ndash; another lesson learned).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning also happens in the process of getting familiar with my new faculty life! It&amp;rsquo;s extremely exciting for me to join the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ci/Programs/LearningTech.html&#34;&gt;Learning Technologies (LT) program&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lt.umn.edu/&#34;&gt;LT Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; at UMN. A lot of &amp;ldquo;first times&amp;rdquo; have happened during the past three weeks since my official start date: the first program meeting, the first faculty meeting, the first writing group meetup, the first time I ran behind the University shuttle, and the first class meeting&amp;hellip; Everything is still fresh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among all those excitements, I am especially excited about the course I am teaching this Spring: &lt;strong&gt;Learning Analytics in the Knowledge Age&lt;/strong&gt;. It is currently offered as a &lt;em&gt;special topics&lt;/em&gt; course in our program and may be offered as an ordinary course in the future. It is the first course I am teaching independently. In the first class meeting last week, I was glad to see a wonderful mix of graduate students bringing in unique expertise and interests from several areas, including educational psychology, STEM education, computer science, pharmacy, and LT. There will be a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;design-of-the-course&#34;&gt;Design of the course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is designed to be a &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Building&lt;/strong&gt; course. All participants are seen as equal contributors to the field of learning analytics. All students enrolled in the course become &lt;em&gt;builders&lt;/em&gt; of the field! That&amp;rsquo;s one exciting thing of diving into such a new field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backgrounds and interests brought in by students will make the course extremely fun to teach. So I designed two types of groups in which they would shine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Interest Groups (SIGs)&lt;/strong&gt;: I suggested five themes of learning analytics students could choose to specialize, such as knowledge modeling, social networks, and text mining. (The choice of themes was totally arbitrary and is subject to change.) Students gathering around one theme will be leading one class session. Over the course, each of us will be able to experience all five themes, but will also be able to dive deeper into a specialization theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Groups (WGs)&lt;/strong&gt;: Students will design group projects that they would work on through this course. Students working on one group project becomes a working group. They will make use of ideas from readings and in the community to advance their projects; in the meantime, their work in WGs will also contribute back to the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kf.utoronto.ca:8080/kforum/home.xhtml&#34;&gt;Knowledge Forum&lt;/a&gt; will be used as the course environment because it is still the most powerful tool I see to support flexible idea development. We will be able to try some analytic tools in Knowledge Forum &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;exploring&lt;/em&gt; the capacity of learning analytics in supporting growth in learning in different domains. We will see whether we could also advance some of the Knowledge Forum analytic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-is-this-course-different-from-others&#34;&gt;How is this course different from others?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been a few awesome courses offered on this topic, mostly in the form of MOOCs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTArlingtonX/LINK5.10x/&#34;&gt;Data, Analytics, and Learning&lt;/a&gt;, offered by George Siemens, et al. on edX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata-edu&#34;&gt;Big Data in Education&lt;/a&gt;, offered by Ryan Baker on Coursera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.canvas.net/courses/33&#34;&gt;LAK Course 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://solaresearch.org/core/2012-learning-analytics-and-knowledge-course/&#34;&gt;LAK Course 2012&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://solaresearch.org/corecat/courses/&#34;&gt;its bibliography&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://solaresearch.org/core/learning-and-knowledge-analytics-course/&#34;&gt;LAK Course 2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These courses have been amazing resources for myself to learn the field as well as to design the current course. However, the course I am offering is designed to be quite different from them in the following two aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, because we would have much more time, we would have chance &lt;strong&gt;to explore more issues concerned with &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than solely focusing on analytics. For instance, we would explore new competencies that are important in the so-called knowledge age while learning analytic techniques. We would also explore the linkages between analytics with pedagogy and epistemology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, as mentioned above, students will be advancing projects in their WGs. So they are expected to &lt;strong&gt;produce new knowledge to solve real-world problems&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than acquiring new knowledge and skills in this field. Of course, learning new analytic techniques will be an important component of taking this course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there are many lessons for me to learn &amp;ndash; as a teacher, co-learner, and knowledge-builder in the class. If you are also interested in this course, feel free to check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/meefen/LA-UMN&#34;&gt;its course materials&lt;/a&gt;. Suggestions are more than welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;锵锵，在我写&lt;a href=&#34;/cn/2014/05/27/哲学性的婴儿一婴儿并非弱弱的人类/&#34;&gt;系列之一&lt;/a&gt;时，你刚刚半个月。如今整整七个月过去了，你已经长成一个眼睛四处观察、嘴里牙牙乱语的机灵小伙儿。之所以现在才写第二篇，一方面是因为繁忙，另一方面则因为时常被一个问题叨扰：“眼前这个常无理取闹的家伙真的是充满哲学性的婴儿吗？”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此时，七个月大的你，正在一旁拨弄着妈咪给你买的圣诞礼物——三个不同样式的小球。这三个小球各有特点：一个五颜六色、带有圆点图案，刺激视觉；一个表面凸凹带有颗粒、抓握方便，刺激触觉；一个内部套有一个装有小颗粒的小球，摇动时会沙沙着响，刺激听觉。当圣诞清晨和你一起拆开礼物时，你拿到每个小球时的第一反应都是拿到嘴边咬一咬、尝尝味道，让我们乐了半天。如今两天过去了，你拿到第一个球时会翻来覆去地看，碰到第二个时会尝试用一只手抓起来，拿到第二个时会不停地摇出声响。我为你不经意的行为有些惊讶——有限的探索，你已经认识了每个球，建立起了有关他们的各种关联。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81paItJgAVL._SL1500_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其实我并不应该惊讶。回想起来，从你刚出生被立马放到妈妈胸前时，你已经在建立各种因果关系了。那时的你是那么努力地抬起头，试图看清妈妈的面容。那一刻你是不是已经感受到了妈妈慈爱的眼神、温暖的体温？是不是听到了你妈妈肚子里一直就在听的熟悉的心跳？这一切，是不是都让你觉得可以依靠？如同那些诗句塑造的那样，妈妈于你就意味着“依靠”——无论因为什么原因嚎啕大哭时，妈妈的怀抱是你最好的安慰（当然，爸爸的也不赖哦）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;你开始识别生活中的不同的人，见到平时就和自己亲近的人会放松，遇到慈祥的老太太时会高兴，碰到陌生的大胡子叔叔时会害怕。这些都并不是简单的如吮吸式的条件反射了，而是你长期的分析判断、概率统计后形成的对人际关系、对爱的理论。一个有趣的心理学实验发现：当小婴儿从一个装有更多白色球的盒子里抓出红色球时，他/她会注视实验人员更长时间，表达困惑。婴儿小小年纪就对概率有清晰的感知。而概率是建立因果关系的重要基础。你小脑袋里建立起的这些理论就藏有你习得各种的因果连接——按动玩具钢琴上的琴键就会播放音乐；拨动蹦椅上的机关就会听到大象的叫声；你用某种眼神看着妈妈、用某种声音喊着妈妈时妈妈会喂你；爸爸把快要睡着的你轻轻放在床上时，代表他要溜走；奶奶和妈妈在厨房忙活是要给你开饭了；我们拍着手喊“一二三”时，是叫你在蹦椅上跳；夜里你吵闹时把你抱起你就知道停止哭泣甚至露出得意的微笑……这些因果关系里，与人相关的来得更加重要，因为你作为婴儿凡事依赖“他人”。通过精确拿捏你和其他人的关系，你就能轻松地把亲人们玩弄于股掌之间，又避免陌生人带来的潜在危险。人际关系上，你可以说已经是个小人精了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这几个月里，你除了睡觉、吃饭、锻炼身体之外，没干别的——就在忙于织一张&lt;strong&gt;因果关系网&lt;/strong&gt;。手里的球掉了要到地下去找；奶奶给你剥桔子的时候你就张开了嘴；爸爸把你放到床上给你摸香香时就开始兴奋；睡前把你放到妈妈身旁你就知道要开吃了。更重要的是，你的学习不带任何目的——因为这个世界的一切几乎都是新的。我读一篇论文常会带着目的去读，或许时常忽视掉论文里本来更有价值的部分。而你不然，对&lt;strong&gt;所有事物&lt;/strong&gt;（尤其是新事物）都全盘关注，一点都不落下。昨天，我们散步偶然路过一间教堂，进去体验他们的礼拜。你好奇地看着周围的人和事物。每当唱诗班音乐响起，你就欢腾地跳个不停。今天，我们在参观吃饭，你被一台电脑上不时闪烁的蓝色指示灯吸引，默默观察了好久。你其实就像是一位真正的&lt;strong&gt;旅行者&lt;/strong&gt;，把自己的全部感官都交给身处的环境，全身心地去感受身边的人、事、文化、风景。感受得多了，你就积累起了对各种事物的经验推断，自己小脑袋里就装了好多好多小小理论。和我相同的是，你时常可以熟练地运用这些理论进行逻辑推断；和“迂腐顽固”的我不一样的是，当你遇到反例时，短暂的困惑后你会更乐意去修改这些理论，而不是抱着成见不放。凭借你这个建立起来并不断更新的因果网，你似乎已掌握“生存之道”了——当然，目前还是建立在操控大人的基础上 :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;写到这里时，你又在那里开始用力地敲击玩具琴键。每敲击一下，你就能听到一小段音乐，一直敲击音乐就能串联起来成一首曲子。但是对你来说最有意思的是琴键上方的那一小排分别标有小动物头像的按钮，敲击他们会发出各种动物的叫声。你顾不了音乐，乐此不疲地敲击小动物们。或许你正在建立动物和他们叫声的联系吧。像你的“同类们”一样，你有何尝不是充满哲学性的婴儿呢？&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Twitter Archeology of the Learning Analytics Community</title>
      <link>/blog/2014-10-14-twitter-archeology/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics as a nascent field of scholarship is evolving rapidly and garnering broad interest in both educational research and practice. Since the inaugural Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conference in 2011, exciting moves have been made during the past four years. The Society of Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) was launched in 2012; the Learning Analytics Summer Institute (LASI) was first held in 2013; the first issue of the Journal of Learning Analytics was published in 2014. After having its own professional organization, annual gatherings, and academic journal, I think it is fair to say learning analytics has established itself as an independent field of study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for &lt;a href=&#34;http://lak15.solaresearch.org&#34;&gt;LAK15&lt;/a&gt;, two colleagues and I played with an idea of &lt;strong&gt;mining Twitter archives from the past LAK conferences to uncover insights about the community&lt;/strong&gt;. We call this work &lt;strong&gt;Twitter Archeology&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mhawksey&#34;&gt;Martin Hawksey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://tags.hawksey.info/&#34;&gt;Twitter Archiving Google Sheet&lt;/a&gt; (TAGS; which is in its 6th version right now), we were able to access and compile a (hopefully) complete set of tweets from the past four LAK conferences. We played with a bunch of analysis, including basic descriptive analysis, interaction (social) network analysis, hashtag analysis and topic modeling, and were able to find some interesting results to report. In this blog post, I would like to briefly share two findings that I think are pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-flow-of-the-lak-community&#34;&gt;The Flow of the LAK Community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the composition of the LAK community as reflected by Twitter participation, we tracked participation of all Twitter participants over the years, focusing on new and returning people each year. The results are visualized as a Sankey diagram below. In this diagram, the horizontal axis represents the time dimension, with each column representing one conference. The fifth (or last) column represents participants who stopped participating at some point &amp;ndash; in other words, those who &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo; the community. Within each column, new and returning participants are presented separately. In the diagram, all lines are drawn from left to right, representing the flow of participants from one section to another between two columns; the width of a line denotes the volume of its flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/sankey.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sankey Diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To our surprise, &lt;strong&gt;only a small fraction of participants have been returning to LAK conferences&amp;rsquo; Twitter discussion&lt;/strong&gt;, indicated by the thinner lines towards the &amp;ldquo;Back&amp;rdquo; sections of LAK12 to LAK14. By looking at the returning participants more closely, we found that only 18 colleagues (among all 1,217 unique participants) participated in Twitter discussion during all LAK conferences. This number only increased to 55 when we counted users participating at least three conferences. Overall, the majority of participants only participated in one conference and never returned. The LAK community seems to be &amp;ldquo;fluid&amp;rdquo; reflected by Twitter participation during its annual conferences. While it keeps attracting interested people from various domains, the community is still more or less unstable as an emerging field of research and practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolution-of-research-topics&#34;&gt;Evolution of Research Topics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to tracking users, we were also interested in tracking research topics, especially because learning analytics is such a new field with various research interests emerging all the time. So we applied &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation&#34;&gt;latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&#34;http://meefen.github.io/blog/2013/07/01/topic-modeling-and-visualization-of-knowledge-forum-discussion/&#34;&gt;I had some opportuniticies to play with  before&lt;/a&gt;, to uncover underlying topics in Twitter discussion during LAK conferences. We thought this could somehow complement previous analysis of learning analytics literature in recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://lak.linkededucation.org&#34;&gt;LAK Data Challenges&lt;/a&gt; because not everything has made it into the literature yet and not everyone having an interest in learning analytics would necessarily want to publish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some fine-tuning of LDA, we were pretty happy with a 34-topic model. After exploring each individual topic and its top terms with the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis&#34;&gt;LDAvis&lt;/a&gt; R package, we found &lt;strong&gt;tweet topics generally fell into a few distinguishable categories&lt;/strong&gt;, including (1) information-sharing related to conferences and the community (e.g., sessions, workshops, slides), (2) experience-sharing and comments (e.g., &amp;ldquo;how much someone loved a study&amp;rdquo;), and (3) specific research topics (such as MOOC, assessment, students, course design). We further tagged each topic with its pertinent terms and then focused on topics most relevant to learning analytics research in order to track their evolution over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/track_topics.png&#34; alt=&#34;Topic Evolution&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line chart above illustrates the change of eleven selected topics. The x-axis represents &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;; the y-axis represents the percentage of a topic in a year&amp;rsquo;s tweets. As a validity check, two topics popular in LAK14 are included: Topic 10 {social use media win networks share survey ipad} was related to a promoted project and Topic 11 {graesser systems predictive agents model tutors} was about a keynote speech. These two topics both peeked during LAK14, showing a certain level of validity of our LDA model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further inspection of the topics identified &lt;strong&gt;an increasing emphasis on students, need, assessment, and feedback in the community&lt;/strong&gt;, indicated by the growing popularity of Topics 1-4. The popularity of student-related topics seemed to agree with previous topic modeling of LAK publications (&lt;a href=&#34;http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-974/lakdatachallenge2013_08.pdf&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;), although previous work didn&amp;rsquo;t look at the trend. In addition, each year&amp;rsquo;s conference presented unique hot topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topics relevant to ethics and social media were relatively popular at LAK11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big data, linked data, and educational data mining were trending at LAK12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Course design, ethical issues, discourse, and measurement were popular during LAK13&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topics involving assessment, student needs, intelligent tutors, and educational data mining were rising at LAK14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure how much the results reflect the real experience of the attendees. In case you were one of them, please do share your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reflections&#34;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter whether it is generally helpful or systematically flawed, Twitter analytics has revealed some interesting phenomena about the community. The biggest challenge of this work, and also one criticism I expect from reviewers, is that because not all conference participants or community members use Twitter, the analysis of tweets could only reconstruct parts of the dialogues and would run the risk of missing important messages, events, or figures. Someone may also very well question whether people gathering around a Twitter hashtag could be treated as a &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; at all &amp;ndash; if we apply a higher standard for a community. As a matter of fact, because of the unique information diffusion mechanism of Twitter, people who were peripheral in the network might only retweeted something from an influential figure. Should we count her as a &amp;ldquo;community member&amp;rdquo; at all? Those are all valid worries I currently do not have a good response to. Maybe if we connect tweets and academic publications (and maybe people&amp;rsquo;s blogs), we would be able to construct a more integrated picture of the learning analytics community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find more about the work, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://meefen.github.io/public/files/Chen_LAK15_Twitter_Archeology.pdf&#34;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the LAK15 proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knowledge Forum API: A demo</title>
      <link>/blog/2014-06-06-knowledge-forum-api/</link>

      <description>
        

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Forum&#34;&gt;Knowledge Forum (KF)&lt;/a&gt; has been recognized as the founding software in the computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) community. And it was also one of the earliest to offer embedded analytic tools for formative assessment. Thanks to contributions from a broad international community, a number of analytic tools have been developed for KF, including a suite of embedded applets (e.g., Contributions, Social Networks, Semantic Overlap, Vocabulary Growth, and Lexical Analysis; see &lt;a href=&#34;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1599732&#34;&gt;Teplovs et al., 2007&lt;/a&gt;), a standalone Analytic Toolkit (ATK, Burtis, 1998), and more recently, a few independent analytic tools such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://tccl.rit.albany.edu/wpsite/?page_id=265&#34;&gt;Idea Thread Mapper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://kbdex.org/&#34;&gt;Knowledge Building Discourse Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. Underlying these development projects is a fundamental emphasis of &lt;a href=&#34;http://ikit.org/kbi/knowledge-building&#34;&gt;knowledge building&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;the theory and pedagogy behind Knowledge Forum&amp;mdash;on &amp;ldquo;embedded, concurrent, transformative assessment&amp;rdquo; for continual idea improvement. Thus, both the spirits and practice of learning analytics are present within the established line of knowledge building research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such a strong presence of learning analytics, I have a few complains about the way those analytic tools have been developed. First, developing an embedded analytic applet for the old KF is not a trivial task. Because an applet (written in Java Swing) uses the same communication mechanism as the core KF client, writing it requires a certain level of familiarity with the core KF codebase. This situation makes prototyping new tools especially difficult. Second, the condition for developing those independent analytic tools such as Idea Thread Mapper is not ideal either. Such work requires similar familiarity with KF development stack, and thus demands direct support from the core engineering team. Moreover, because teams in our distributed international community tend to favor a variety of different development stacks (relation vs. non-relation databases, for instance), plenty of redundant efforts have been made to retrieve KF data. We definitely need a more agile and standard way to make KF data accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when developing the next-generation Knowledge Forum, I have been advocating for &lt;strong&gt;an open Knowledge Forum API&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to our engineer team&amp;rsquo;s hard work, such an API is finally taking shape. It is currently being used to develop an iPad version of KF. Because of my interests in learning analytics, I am especially interested in building a new technological framework for KF analytics. In this post, I am going to demo the API in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, a statistical programming language widely used by data scientists, to demonstrate how analytics could be compiled using the new API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The API is in its preliminary stage. So any suggestion will be appreciated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/meefen/KF-R&#34;&gt;an R wrapper for the KF API&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to work with the API in R. This library currently depends on two R packages: &lt;code&gt;RCurl&lt;/code&gt;&amp;mdash;to make HTTP calls to the API, and &lt;code&gt;jsonlite&lt;/code&gt;&amp;mdash;to parse JSON objects returned by the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After loading the API library functions, you would need to create a &amp;lsquo;curl handle&amp;rsquo; that will be shared by all API calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
source(&amp;ldquo;kf-api-lib.R&amp;rdquo;) # load the function library&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-curl-handle-that-will-be-shared-among-api-calls&#34;&gt;Create a curl handle that will be shared among API calls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;curl = CreateCurlHandle()
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;user-authentication&#34;&gt;User authentication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the server and login information is configured, user authentication can be done with one line of code. The results of authentication contain information about which sections (or knowledge-building communities) I&amp;rsquo;m currently registered in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;login-info&#34;&gt;Login info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;host = &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kf.utoronto.ca:8080/kforum/&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;http://kf.utoronto.ca:8080/kforum/&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
username = &amp;ldquo;bodong&amp;rdquo; # YOUR_USERNAME
password = &amp;ldquo;******&amp;rdquo; # YOUR_PASSWORD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;regs = Authenticate(host, username, password, curl)
regs[, c(&amp;ldquo;sectionId&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;sectionTitle&amp;rdquo;)] # check sections I&amp;rsquo;m in
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                              sectionId              sectionTitle
## 1 416658e6-b49f-4189-8f9a-fe78d8b5f4c1            KF Stress Test
## 2 b1f6fed2-a64e-4bd2-ab8b-393fb2ed1f06 Knowledge Society Network
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrieve-my-posts-in-a-community&#34;&gt;Retrieve my posts in a community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being authenticated, I can now access data in communities I&amp;rsquo;m a member of. Let&amp;rsquo;s first take a look at how posts (or notes) can be retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the library, I could get all posts in a specific community and only keep mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;choose-a-section-community-i-m-interested-in&#34;&gt;Choose a section/community I&amp;rsquo;m interested in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;userId = regs$authorInfo.guid[2]
sectionId = regs$sectionId[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-my-posts&#34;&gt;2. My posts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;posts = GetSectionPosts(host, sectionId, curl)
myPosts = FilterPostsByAuthors(posts, userId) # all my posts here
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can do all kinds of things with the results. For example, we can compare the number of my posts with the community average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
authors = do.call(&amp;ldquo;rbind&amp;rdquo;, posts$authors) # all unique authors
tmp = data.frame(author=factor(c(&amp;ldquo;Me&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;Average&amp;rdquo;), levels=c(&amp;ldquo;Me&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;Average&amp;rdquo;)), notes=c(nrow(myPosts), nrow(posts)/length(unique(authors$guid))))
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(data=tmp, aes(x=author, y=notes, fill=author)) +
  geom_bar(colour=&amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo;, stat=&amp;ldquo;identity&amp;rdquo;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;ldquo;Number of my posts compared to community average&amp;rdquo;) +
  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  theme_solarized()
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/kf-api-compare-with-average.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could also create a calendar to visualize my posting activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
dates = strptime(myPosts$created, &amp;ldquo;%b %d, %Y %I:%M:%S %p&amp;rdquo;)
dates_str = as.character(format(dates, format=&amp;ldquo;%Y-%m-%d&amp;rdquo;))
tmp = data.frame(table(dates_str))
names(tmp) = c(&amp;ldquo;date&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo;)
CalendarHeatmap(tmp, title=&amp;ldquo;Posting Activities&amp;rdquo;)
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/kf-api-posting-calendar.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously I have been not super active in this community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also find out the top terms in my posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
library&amp;trade;
myNotes = Corpus(VectorSource(myPosts$body))
myDtm &amp;lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(myNotes, control = list(
  stopwords = TRUE, minWordLength = 3,
  removeNumbers = TRUE, removePunctuation = TRUE))
myFreqTerms = findFreqTerms(myDtm, 8, 100)
myFreq = colSums(inspect(myDtm[, myFreqTerms]))
tmp = sort(freq, decreasing=TRUE)
data.frame(term=names(tmp), freq=tmp, row.names=NULL)
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        term freq
1  knowledge   24
2   building   21
3       will   17
4  analytics   14
5       note   14
6       view   13
7     badges   11
8       open   10
9     design    8
10      need    8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I posted mostly about &lt;em&gt;knowledge building&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;analytics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;open badges&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;inspect-a-specific-view&#34;&gt;Inspect a specific view&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Knowledge Forum, a &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; is a 2D space where &lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt; (or posts) are organized. It is one of the most important feature that distinguishes KF from threaded discussion tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the API, I could retrieve all views in the current community:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;views = GetSectionViews(host, sectionId, curl)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I can further inspect one specific view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;viewId = views[15, &amp;quot;guid&amp;quot;] # I&#39;m interested in view #15
view = GetView(host, viewId, curl)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more detailed information about this view, we can count number of its posts and calculate the percentage of &lt;em&gt;build-ons&lt;/em&gt; among those posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;nrow(view$viewPostRefs)
nrow(view$buildOns) / nrow(view$viewPostRefs)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could also re-visualize the view, given the location of each note is also stored in the JSON object returned by the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;ggplot(view$viewPostRefs, aes(x=location$point$x, y=location$point$y)) +
  geom_text(aes(label=postInfo$title), hjust=0) +
  ggtitle(view$title) +
  scale_y_reverse() + theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title=element_blank(),
        axis.text=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks=element_blank(),
        panel.grid=element_blank())
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/kf-api-revisualize-view.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to what&amp;rsquo;s done for my personal notes, we can also find top terms used by posts within this view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;notes = Corpus(VectorSource(view$viewPostRefs$postInfo$body))
dtm &amp;lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(notes, control = list(
  stopwords = TRUE, minWordLength = 3,
  removeNumbers = TRUE, removePunctuation = TRUE))
freqTerms = findFreqTerms(dtm, 8, 100)
freq = colSums(inspect(dtm[, freqTerms]))

tmp = sort(freq, decreasing=TRUE)
data.frame(term=names(tmp), freq=tmp, row.names=NULL)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        term freq
1       note   45
2       view   33
3      notes   22
4        can   17
5        new   13
6       will   13
7        tap   12
8       work   12
9        add   10
10    chrome   10
11    issues   10
12   version   10
13     ideas    9
14       one    9
15     views    9
16  attached    8
17     build    8
18    design    8
19      idea    8
20       ios    8
21      need    8
22 scaffolds    8
23      text    8
24     title    8
25       use    8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, I can further find out the overlap between the community&amp;rsquo;s and my own top terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;intersect(myFreqTerms, freqTerms)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;design&amp;quot; &amp;quot;need&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;note&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;view&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;will&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-work&#34;&gt;Future work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a researcher interested in learning analytic tools, I am personally very excited about this API. As shown in this demo, it makes prototyping in R extremely easy. Using &lt;code&gt;rApache&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Shiny&lt;/code&gt;, we could further turn prototypes into analytic tools that can be seamlessly integrated within the new KF. Of course, you could choose to access the API in other languages such as Python and Java as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the API is still in its preliminary stage. More work needs to be done to make user clicklog accessible. Meanwhile, it should also support posting data backwards to KF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://ikit.org/summerinstitute2014/&#34;&gt;Knowledge Building Summer Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Quebec City, I will be leading a knowledge building analytics workshop to further discuss the design of this API. Other broader issues related to epistemological, ethical, and technological aspects of knowledge building analytics will also be explored. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;不知从何时开始，网上开始流传各种卓略的父母如何机智地教育自己孩子的段子。段子的模式通常是这样的：孩子犯了个错误，父亲或母亲机智点拨，孩子人生观瞬间升华。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不知是因为个人对小孩创新的研究兴趣、还是个性批判和叛逆，每每我听到这类段子总会起一身鸡皮疙瘩。我不禁会问：有多少父母这样俯视自己的孩子？有多少父母一生都如此俯视自己的孩子？让父母像大人的学习的段子去哪里了？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《圣经》的马太福音中有个小故事：有一天，门徒们问耶稣，在天国里谁最伟大？耶稣找来了一个小孩子，指着孩子对门徒们说：你们若不变得像小孩子那样天真，就进不了天国。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而事实上，孩子能让父母学习的地方远非“很傻很天真” 这一项。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;人的学习绝非传统认识里的知识传输，而是一个复杂、多样的社会化过程。因为身处环境的不同，孩子学到的东西注定和父母是很不一样的。虽然历史中有亘古不变的道理，但一味地让孩子接受自己观念的做法注定是短视的。除开父母之外，孩子在发展过程中不断地在和老师、同伴、亲友、以及媒体交流，他们在很多想法上一定会超越父母。父母需要更多地蹲下来，好好向自己的孩子学习一二才对。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;当父母只想着用他们的观念来控制孩子，教育就已经失败了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;请把“父为子纲”、“不听老人言，会长牛皮癣” 这样的话都扔进历史的窠臼里吧。&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;既希望你不凡，又希望你无异。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;既希望你超常，又希望你普通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;既希望你自控，又希望你不羁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;你——我们的小婴儿——从降生就就引来了我无限的好奇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;你是人们常说的那个来讨债的“恶魔”吗？出生后的第二个夜晚，你哭闹了整夜，惊动着同屋的那个安静的小妹妹，害得我抱着你在医院走廊里来回游荡。回到家的头几天，你还是很哭闹——睡觉前、换尿布时、洗澡中、胀气时……有时，你的哭闹声震耳欲聋，让已经十分耐心的我也不禁烦躁。这还不够，你不时地给正在给你换尿布的我来个惊喜，让全家忙不迭地帮你清理。是的，你似乎就是那个传说中的恶魔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;可后来，你在吃完奶后笑了。微微地，嘴角上扬了一下。这让大家乐开了花。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有人为你辩护，哭闹是你唯一的表达方式，而解读你的哭闹是我们大人的义务和责任。又有人说，这一切都是进化的结果：人类高级之处是需要在下一代上倾注大量心血、以传递更多知识。然后你伸了个懒腰，又笑了，你成了我们心里的小天使。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其实我知道，你那一笑或许并非真心。出生的这几天，你大脑在疯长。大量的神经元在连接。别骗我，你那一笑或许就是某根神经触发的结果，让你脸部肌肉抽搐了一下而已。可是你还是卖萌成功博得了家人的欢心，用这么一点点投入换来了十足的回报。我都懒得戳穿你了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;你是一个和我一样的人类吗？对，我是说一个正常的人类。有人说，婴儿是人一种未发育完整时的状态，通过生长逐渐变得完善和复杂。又有人说，婴儿和成人其实是两种完全不同的人类。婴儿其实和成人一样复杂，只是设计有不同的进化功能而已。因此人的发展并非线性，而更像“化茧为蝶”。你到底复杂在哪里？这让我对你更加感兴趣，想从你那里学到新的东西——那些在我还是个婴儿时被遗忘掉的东西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第一个我需要向你学习的是你的大脑的开放性和可塑性。这是从婴儿到成人发展过程中丢掉的东西。是的，你现在没有自控能力，因为你大脑负责自控的“前额皮质”还没完全发育。但你因此而变得开放而充满想象。你可以瞪着一个玩具小鸟很久很久。我也不知道你在想些什么，这个世界上还没人知道。但我知道你的大脑现在充满无限可能。它里面连接通畅，就像一个交通良好的城市，往哪里走都可以。而我就自愧不如了，多年的磨砺，我大脑已经被植入了很多程序，让我不自觉地选择更“便捷”的通路。换句话说，你不歧视你大脑里的任何一条链接，而我为了高效已经废弃了很多链接，以致它们日益萎缩了。因此，你大脑不如我高效，却比我更有想象力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有一天，你还开始学会注视我的眼睛了。好久，足足有十秒。虽然你没笑着讨好我，但似乎你知道我的存在。你似乎不是那个只顾表达自己需求的“恶魔”，你原来充满社会性。你哭闹时我会给你唱歌，有时你会安静下来，看看我，哪怕一小会。有时你从睡梦中惊醒，我轻轻拍拍你，你睁开眼睛瞥见了我，然后长舒一口气后又睡着了。现在只有两周的你，还没有掌握用声音和动作和我交互，但似乎你已经学会了用眼神和我交流了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;你黑黑的眼睛里，我看到了我的轮廓，还有我身边的事物。你的眼睛是那么的黑，那么的大，那么的透彻，似乎从中我能把事物看得更透彻。此刻，我已经越发期待向你学习更多的关于这个世界的一切。“世界是什么？我们怎么认识世界？我们是什么？世界有什么可能性？”你——充满哲学性的婴儿——似乎是目前为止最能帮我思考这些问题的人了。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mining frequent sequences in knowledge building dialogues</title>
      <link>/blog/2014-05-02-mining-frequent-sequences/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2014-05-02-mining-frequent-sequences/</guid>
      <description>
        

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/%27Out_Of_Order%27_by_David_Mach_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1102588.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/%27Out_Of_Order%27_by_David_Mach_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1102588.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Out of Order&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;blog/2014/04/17/temporailty-in-dialogues/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I highlighted the significance of studying temporality in collaborative learning and argued it should be studied more widely in learning sciences research because temporality matters for learning in a socio-cultural context. In the specific study I &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/bodong/lak14&#34;&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://lak14indy.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;LAK14&lt;/a&gt;, an analytic technique named &lt;strong&gt;Lag-sequential Analysis (LsA)&lt;/strong&gt; was applied to investigate sequential patterns among six &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259178463_Ways_of_Contributing_to_an_Explanation-Seeking_Dialogue_in_Science_and_History&#34;&gt;contribution types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in knowledge building dialogues by elementary school students. Such analysis was able to uncover temporal patterns that were otherwise undiscoverable using a traditional &amp;ldquo;coding-and-counting&amp;rdquo; technique, which is widely applied in many learning sciences studies. More methodological guidance is needed for the research community to make such technique accessible for more learning scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-frequent-sequence-mining&#34;&gt;Introducing Frequent Sequence Mining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on when working on a MOOC research project at the University of Toronto, I got acquainted to another data mining technique named &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_Pattern_Mining&#34;&gt;Sequential Pattern Mining&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Sequence_Mining/SPADE&#34;&gt;Frequent Sequence Mining &lt;/a&gt; (FSM)&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a well-studied sub-domain of Frequent Pattern Mining. In a nutshell,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequent Sequence Mining is used to discover a set of patterns shared among objects which have between them a specific order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my specific research context, because &lt;a href=&#34;http://ikit.org/kb.html&#34;&gt;knowledge building&lt;/a&gt; is conceptualized as an emergent process in which a community of people collectively improve their ideas by making various types of contributions to their discourse, the major question I was interested in was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to which extent do the sequential relations among different contribution types matter for effective knowledge-building dialogues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it became perfectly straightforward to apply FSM to the problem I was studying, with a hope that it could afford additional insights about temporality in knowledge-building dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-preparation-for-fsm&#34;&gt;Data preparation for FSM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I had two types of knowledge-building dialogues or conceptual &lt;strong&gt;threads&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; (or productive) and &lt;em&gt;improvable&lt;/em&gt;. The first six rows of the thread data looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
&amp;gt; head(dft[, c(1, 3)])
                        thread type
1        HOW ARE ROCKS FORMED?    e
2 ROCK COMPOSITION AND TEXTURE    e
3                      FOSSILS    i
4                ROCKS COLOURS    e
5            Beginning of life    i
6 The creation of the universe    e
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;strong&gt;note&lt;/strong&gt; (aka. post) in each thread was coded into six &lt;em&gt;contribution types&lt;/em&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;questioning&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;theorizing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;obtaining information&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;working with information&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;making synthesis and analogies&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;supporting discussion&lt;/em&gt;. Notes, after being coded, looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}

&lt;p&gt;To conduct FSM, a little bit of data transformation was needed to reorganize data into the following form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
&amp;gt; head(dfc_e) # effective threads
    sequenceID eventID size items
460          1  100460    1     Q

462          1  100462    1     T
463          1  100463    1    WE
464          1  100464    1     T
465          1  100465    1     T
&amp;gt; head(dfc_i) # improvable threads
   sequenceID eventID size items
89          2  200089    1     Q
90          2  200090    1     T
91          2  200091    1     T

93          2  200093    1     T
94          2  200094    1    OE
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;improvable&lt;/em&gt; threads were partitioned into two separate tables with a same structure. To conform with the requirements of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arulesSequences/index.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;arulesSequences&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; R package I was using, a thread was named a &lt;code&gt;sequence&lt;/code&gt;, notes within it were represented as &lt;code&gt;events&lt;/code&gt;, and coded contributions within a note were &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-fsm-on-knowledge-building-dialogues&#34;&gt;Running FSM on knowledge-building dialogues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After data were organized in this proper format, it became fairly easy to run FSM on each data partition using &lt;code&gt;arulesSequences&lt;/code&gt;. There were a few parameters I could tweak to make the mining more meaningful for my specific research context (see code below). For instance, &lt;code&gt;maxgap&lt;/code&gt; was (arbitrarily) set to 2, so two events with more than 2 events in between will not be captured in a sequence. Also, &lt;code&gt;maxlen&lt;/code&gt; was set to 4, so sequences with more than 4 events will not be picked up. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#Useful_Concepts&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;support&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was 0.1, so the analysis will pick up sequences that appear in at least 10% of a specific type of threads. More detailed explanation of these parameters could be found in arulesSequences&amp;rsquo; documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
library(arulesSequences)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;read-baskets&#34;&gt;read baskets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bskt &amp;lt;- read_baskets(file, info=c(&amp;ldquo;sequenceID&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;eventID&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;SIZE&amp;rdquo;))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;mine-frequent-sequences&#34;&gt;mine frequent sequences&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fs &amp;lt;- cspade(bskt, parameter = list(support = 0.1, maxlen = 4, maxgap = 2), control = list(verbose = TRUE, bfstype=TRUE))
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After frequent sequences were identified for each type of threads, I was able to compare them to inspect whether there were sequences frequent for one type of threads but not for the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-event sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started from comparing single-event sequences, i.e., single contribution types. Comparison of single-event sequences did not find any substantial difference between two types of threads. Apparently, &lt;em&gt;supporting discussion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;working with evidence&lt;/em&gt; happened more frequently in effective threads, but only for a bit more than 6% percent. Improvable threads had more frequent &lt;em&gt;making synthesis and analogies&lt;/em&gt; contributions, and the difference was 11%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
&amp;gt; Differentiate(fs_single_pretty, basket_files, 0.05)
  sequence effective improvable   diff
3    &amp;lt;{S}&amp;gt;      0.81       0.74  0.070
6   &amp;lt;{WE}&amp;gt;      0.48       0.42  0.063
4   &amp;lt;{SY}&amp;gt;      0.26       0.37 -0.110
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results to some extent triangulated with my LAK paper&amp;rsquo;s finding that two types of threads did not significantly differ in percentages of contribution types, even though FSM only counted each contribution type&amp;rsquo;s appearance only once and basic descriptive analysis could count multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-event sequences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing sequences with multiple events were expected to be more interesting. Here, I improved the &lt;code&gt;support&lt;/code&gt; difference threshold to 20%. Results are presented below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
&amp;gt; Differentiate(fs_multi_pretty, basket_files, 0.2)
              sequence effective improvable  diff

125      &amp;lt;{Q},{Q},{T}&amp;gt;     0.645       0.42  0.22
25  &amp;lt;{T},{T},{T},{WE}&amp;gt;     0.323       0.11  0.22
21      &amp;lt;{T},{T},{WE}&amp;gt;     0.419       0.21  0.21
74   &amp;lt;{S},{Q},{T},{T}&amp;gt;     0.419       0.21  0.21
79   &amp;lt;{Q},{S},{T},{T}&amp;gt;     0.419       0.21  0.21
133  &amp;lt;{T},{S},{Q},{T}&amp;gt;     0.419       0.21  0.21
240          &amp;lt;{Q},{Q}&amp;gt;     0.677       0.47  0.20
205     &amp;lt;{OE},{S},{S}&amp;gt;     0.097       0.32 -0.22
211  &amp;lt;{T},{S},{S},{S}&amp;gt;     0.097       0.32 -0.22
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, in &lt;strong&gt;improvable threads&lt;/strong&gt;, students more frequently responded to &lt;em&gt;obtaining evidence&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;theorizing&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;supporting discussion&lt;/em&gt;, which was mostly about &lt;em&gt;giving opinion&lt;/em&gt; on a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;effective threads&lt;/strong&gt;, students had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more sustained &lt;em&gt;theorizing&lt;/em&gt;, represented by several frequent sequences involving multiple &lt;code&gt;{T}&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more integrated use of evidence/information, represented by several frequent transitions between &lt;code&gt;{T}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{OE}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{WE}&lt;/code&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;{T},{T},{OE},{T}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;{OE},{T},{T}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;{T},{T},{T},{WE}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more frequent attempts to problematize proposed theories, represented by &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Q&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, as well as to propose explanations to solve problems, shown by transitions from &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Q&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results were consistent with what was found in the LAK paper using LsA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective dialogues require students to work more constructively with resources, engage in increasingly deepened questioning and theorizing, and problematize proposed explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparing-fsm-with-lsa&#34;&gt;Comparing FSM with LsA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this experimentation, FSM and LsA arrived at similar results. However, there are noticeable differences. First of all, the underlying algorithms of them are quite different. While LsA relies on more basic matrix computation, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Sequence_Mining/SPADE#Algorithm&#34;&gt;SPADE&lt;/a&gt; algorithm implemented in &lt;code&gt;arulesSequences&lt;/code&gt; was basically a process of searching and counting frequent sequences. In a sense, FSM is more flexible in picking up sequential patterns because it could tolerant event &lt;code&gt;gap&lt;/code&gt; to be within a range, whereas LsA (at the version I used) could only configure &lt;code&gt;lag&lt;/code&gt; to a specific value (e.g., 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, because of the differences in computation, the results are also quite different. LsA could do significance tests, providing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; values many researchers would like. In contrast, FSM produces values of &lt;code&gt;support&lt;/code&gt; which can be compared among groups. It could also induce &lt;em&gt;association rules&lt;/em&gt; from frequent sequences, to provide most sophisticated &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#Useful_Concepts&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;interestingness&lt;/em&gt; measures&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;confidence&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt;, for additional comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As two analytic techniques, both FSM and LsA focus on sequentiality of events so could be applied to study the temporal aspect of learning phenomena. My code for FSM is shared as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/meefen/7454d2fc8b9bc821c12a&#34;&gt;Github gist&lt;/a&gt;. Please feel free to tweak it to work with your own data. Since I am also learning FSM, corrections and comments are more than welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why the quality of Finland&#39;s education system can exceed the quality of its teachers?</title>

      <description>
        

&lt;p&gt;Assessing one single student is not easy, not to mention an education system. Yet, OECD has been running a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/&#34;&gt;Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)&lt;/a&gt; since 2000 to evaluate education systems by testing the skills and knowledge of 15-year-olds around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of its superb performance in PISA since 2000, Finland&amp;rsquo;s education system has been celebrated worldwide. It had been holding the top spot in PISA&amp;rsquo;s overall ranking for years, attracting other countries to study and imitate its model. However, Finland has fallen from the top &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1385713778649&#34;&gt;in 2009 &lt;/a&gt;, and has further &amp;ldquo;declined&amp;rdquo; more recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.minedu.fi/pisa/2012.html?lang=en&#34;&gt;in 2012 &amp;ndash; in all three subjects including math, reading and scientific literacies&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1385713778649&#34;&gt;some Finns feeling concerned&lt;/a&gt;. Equally concerned are some Canadians, especially with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1272695/ontario-student-results-on-international-pisa-test-hold-steady-in-reading-and-science-decline-in-math&#34;&gt;their math performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, several Asian economies, including Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea, have taken the top spots. Shanghai is now widely &lt;a href=&#34;http://asiasociety.org/education/learning-world/shanghai-worlds-best-school-system&#34;&gt;celebrated as the best education system&lt;/a&gt;, pretty much like Finland was years ago. Western countries, especially those declined in recent PISA tests, are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/what-shanghai-can-teach-us-about-teaching-math/article17835021/?page=all&#34;&gt;looking into Shanghai for keys to &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, educational scholars Yong Zhao called it &lt;a href=&#34;http://zhaolearning.com/2013/12/02/reading-the-pisa-tea-leaves-who-is-responsible-for-finland%E2%80%99s-decline-and-the-asian-magic/&#34;&gt;a mistake to assume that the Asian systems have made significant improvement and surpassed Finland&lt;/a&gt;, and criticized PISA test for shifting the world&amp;rsquo;s attention away from Finland to Shanghai (Part &lt;a href=&#34;http://zhaolearning.com/2014/03/09/how-does-pisa-put-the-world-at-risk-part-1-romanticizing-misery/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://zhaolearning.com/2014/03/16/how-does-pisa-put-the-world-at-risk-part-2-glorifying-educational-authoritarianism/&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://zhaolearning.com/2014/03/23/how-does-pisa-put-the-world-at-risk-part-3-creating-illusory-models-of-excellence/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://zhaolearning.com/2014/03/29/how-does-pisa-put-the-world-at-risk-part-4-misleading-the-world/&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://zhaolearning.com/2014/04/12/how-does-pisa-put-the-world-at-risk-part-5-racing-to-the-past/&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). He even joked that to become globally competitive, we should all begin to &lt;a href=&#34;http://zhaolearning.com/2012/03/12/pass-the-book-but-which-one-pass-the-book-but-which-one/&#34;&gt;use chopsticks because chopsticks produce better education outcomes as measured by PISA&lt;/a&gt;. Grown up from a same southwestern region of China as Zhao, I share the same sentiments. While western countries are curious about Chinese students&amp;rsquo; academic performance &amp;ndash; measured by test scores &amp;ndash; they might be less aware of &lt;a href=&#34;http://english.cri.cn/7146/2014/03/28/2702s819582.htm&#34;&gt;declining physical health of students in China&lt;/a&gt;, as well as parents&amp;rsquo; weak confidence in school system and growing inequity. It is interesting to witness China&amp;rsquo;s efforts over the years to learn from the West and to free students from tests, and western countries&amp;rsquo; contrary movement towards more tests-and-drills, which I would call as the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Abandoned Chinese Way&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-finnish-lessons&#34;&gt;Learning Finnish Lessons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was a great pleasure to hear &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pasi_sahlberg&#34;&gt;Pasi Sahlberg&lt;/a&gt;, Finnish educator, scholar, and the author of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.finnishlessons.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finnish Lessons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, talking about Finland&amp;rsquo;s education system and the spread of &lt;a href=&#34;http://pasisahlberg.com/global-educational-reform-movement-is-here/&#34;&gt;GERM&lt;/a&gt; last week (&lt;a href=&#34;http://pasisahlberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/OISE-RWB-Jackson-2014.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF slides&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/OISE-RWB-Jackson-2014-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jackson lecture&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started by clarifying that he would not be talking about Finland as the best education system in the world and he would not tell people to copy Finnish model in their own countries, because &amp;ldquo;educational reforms are poor travelers.&amp;rdquo; His talk was about reasons why Finns like him were still so confident in their school systems &amp;ndash; reasons that cannot be captured by PISA scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;teacher-education&#34;&gt;Teacher education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not new to hear that top high school graduates in Finland choose to become a teacher. According to Sahlberg&amp;rsquo;s personal story, his niece, who was a top student when she graduated from high school, applied to a teacher educational program but got rejected for not giving a satisfactory answer to a tricky interview question: &amp;lsquo;why you chose to become a teacher?&amp;rsquo; The competition to get enrolled in a teacher education program is tough. Out of 8500 applicants, according to Sahlberg, only 750 get selected. In a country where most people go to college, that&amp;rsquo;s quite a battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also no secret that it normally takes five to six years to prepare a teacher in Finland (&lt;a href=&#34;https://edpolicy.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/secret-finland%E2%80%99s-success-educating-teachers.pdf&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;). All their teachers have an academic master&amp;rsquo;s degree, with a major in &lt;em&gt;education&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;special education&lt;/em&gt; and meanwhile a minor from a specific subject-related department (e.g., math, biology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, their teacher education is free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key components of teacher education in Finland, as Sahlberg summarized, included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced university preparation for all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research-based academic degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Departmental faculty structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clinical teacher training schools run by the university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-else-besides-teachers&#34;&gt;So what else besides teachers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sahlberg moved forward to talk about the first myth of educational reforms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myth #1: The most important single factor in improving quality of education is teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pointed out many factors behind Finns&amp;rsquo; success. First, Finns share a common vision of education in their country. They work towards &amp;ldquo;great education for each and every child,&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;the best school system in the world.&amp;rdquo; Such a common vision does not exist in many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Finland has an equal society. As he demonstrated in the following figure, inequity seems to be negatively correlated with student achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/OISE-RWB-Jackson-2014-8.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jackson lecture&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when equity gets enhanced, quality of education system measured by student performance also tends to go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/OISE-RWB-Jackson-2014-18.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jackson lecture&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Finland as a country does well in various areas. It excels in many social indicators, ranging from economic competitiveness, to mother index, and to happiness index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors explain why Sahlberg has faith in &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;The Finnish Way&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;rdquo; which emphasizes collaboration, personalization, trust-based responsibility, equity, and professional capital. In contrast, the global educational reform movement (GERM) is moving towards competition, standardization, test-based accountability, choice (e.g., school choice, online learning), and human capital (teacher preparation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/OISE-RWB-Jackson-2014-16.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jackson lecture&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sahlberg warned that GERM is spreading around the world, and has actually been counterproductive to the improvement of education systems, reflected by change of PISA math scores in several OECD countries since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;move-towards-professional-capital&#34;&gt;Move towards professional capital&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second myth of educational reforms Sahlberg discussed was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sahlberg posed the interesting question of &amp;ldquo;what if Finland&amp;rsquo;s great teachers taught in your schools?&amp;rdquo; To help teachers to flourish in teaching, the culture and policies need to be right. So he urged education reformers to think beyond improving human capital (by training individual teacher), and raise attention to the other two dimensions: &lt;strong&gt;social capital&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;decisional capital&lt;/strong&gt;. To improve the effectiveness of an education system, improvements should be made in all three dimensions. In other words, the quality of an education system does not depend on its teachers, but the &lt;em&gt;production&lt;/em&gt; of these three factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/OISE-RWB-Jackson-2014-22.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jackson lecture&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also made an analogy between teaching and playing hockey, which both Canadians and Finns are good at, and pointed out that taking collective responsibility and leadership was key to success. So the Finnish lesson tells us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of an education system &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; exceed the quality of its teachers if teachers work as a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ict-in-finnish-schools&#34;&gt;ICT in Finnish Schools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Q &amp;amp; A session, someone asked how Finns handle digital learning in their education system, noting that mobile phones are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/bloomberg-cell-phone-ban-new-york-schools_n_3179336.html&#34;&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; in NYC public schools. In his response, Sahlberg noted that Finland has one of the most advanced tech infrastructure in the world and thus suffers less digital gaps. However, he said Finnish schools are not making wide use of technologies. As one recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Finland%20country%20profile.pdf&#34;&gt;EU survey in ICT in education&lt;/a&gt; found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students in Finland enjoy among the highest levels in Europe of ICT infrastructure provision, high speed broadband connectivity and ‘connectedness’, yet frequency of ICT use by teachers is above EU means only at grade 11, and by students consistently lower at all grades. Levels of teacher confidence in operational use of ICT are, curiously, below EU means but above when considering their confidence in the use of social media. On the other hand students’ confidence in ICT is around the EU mean (except at grade 11 vocational where it is lower). Support measures for teachers in terms of training and an ICT coordinator appear uneven across grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He remarked that teachers identified the main obstacle of using technologies was inadequate pedagogical advancement of tech. So the lower level of ICT application may indicate higher level of professional preparation which helps teachers be clear about what works in their classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-critiques&#34;&gt;Some critiques&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sahlberg&amp;rsquo;s ideas here offer a significant counter-argument for current move towards standards and test-based accountability, or GERM in his words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are underlying methodological issues with the visualizations in his presentation. First, those two plots showing relations between student achievement and equity (measured by either Gini coefficient or the strength of the relation between achievement and ESCS index) are blind to other possible impacting factors (e.g., GPD per capita). Without controlling such strong predictors of educational performance, a single correlation does not tell much and could be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second critique is around the use of PISA scores to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; success of an educationl system. While one could argue PISA is one of the most widely used measurement out there, presenting Finnish&amp;rsquo;s success in spite of widespread &amp;ldquo;GERM&amp;rdquo; with PISA scores sounds somewhat ironic to me. Finnish stories around how they managed to keep human, social, and decisional capital improving in parallel, or how Finnish education system could develop professional strength and moral health to keep itself immune from &amp;ldquo;GERM&amp;rdquo;, would be more interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The taste of time: Temporality in students&#39; explanation building dialogues</title>
      <link>/blog/2014-04-17-temporailty-in-dialogues/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Things unfold over time. One thing I remember from my high school history lessons is that a particular historical event, e.g., a war, could be triggered by one single incident, but might also be already predetermined by a broader historical context. In the time dimension, various factors come into play, interact with each other, and frame historical events. So interpretation of any event needs to take various factors and players involved. And that&amp;rsquo;s what makes history so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/2014-04-17-clock.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Credit: stockvault&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooking is another interesting context to think about time. While a perfect dish requires the right amounts of different ingredients and them being cooked for a certain &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of time, in many cases it also depends on ingredients been added in a certain &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; so they could interact and produce desired flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is important for learning and teaching. Educators ask all sorts of questions about time: In which age should students be taught what and what? How much time a pupil should spend in school each day? At which time should students be doing what types of activities? In a specific lesson, what should a class do in a specific moment? By asking these questions, we care about (1) the optimal temporal moment learning should happen, (2) the amount of time learning requires, and (3) the desired sequence of events to achieve a learning goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recent work in the area of learning analytics has focused on the third aspect&amp;mdash;the sequence of learning events&amp;mdash;which I think is under-represented in educational research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In classrooms where most of my research happens, students work together to build explanations about scientific phenomena or historical events, following a pedagogy called knowledge building. In the process, students carry on communal, constructive dialogues, with a goal to advance their shared understanding. They contribute to their dialogues in many different ways, such as asking a thought-provoking question, proposing a theory, introducing information, making synthesis, and monitoring discussion. We call them ways of contributing to knowledge-building dialogues, and have been working to understand what a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; dialogue looks like based on the composition of different contribution types, just like figuring out the right ingredients for a good dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, research efforts so far relying descriptive metrics of contribution types have largely failed. They failed because of the failure to recognize the fact that a delicious dish is not only a function of the amounts of required ingredients, but also how they get added. Like many educational studies, our efforts thus far applied a &amp;ldquo;coding and counting&amp;rdquo; strategy, collapsed the temporal structure of events, and forced the important temporal aspect of learning to be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://lak14indy.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;LAK14&lt;/a&gt; paper attempts to (start to) address this issue. By applying Lag-sequential Analysis, I uncovered what really matters for effective explanation building dialogues. While descriptive metrics failed, I identified a few transitional patterns among contribution types distinguishing effective dialogues from ineffective ones. More specifically, effective dialogues require students to work more constructively with resources, engage in increasingly deepened questioning and theorizing, and problematize proposed explanations. More details of this research could be found in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/bodong/lak14&#34;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/file/chen_resendes_lak14_temporal.pdf&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital learning in Ontario schools: A &#39;new normal&#39;</title>
      <link>/blog/2014-03-31-digital-learning-in-ontario-schools/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Supported by a Mitacs fellowship, I have been working with a
Toronto-based non-profit organization, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peopleforeducation.ca/&#34;&gt;People for
Education (P4E)&lt;/a&gt;, to investigate
digital learning in Ontario public schools since October 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trinidad.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/children-playing-1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.trinidad.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/children-playing-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo credit:
trinidad&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, a report about digital learning in Ontario schools has been
officially &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peopleforeducation.ca/pfe-news/7427/&#34;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;.
Although there have been studies of digital learning in the Canadian
context, this topic has not been system-wise inspected. This report
draws on a rich set of data coming from P4E&amp;rsquo;s annual principal
questionnaire participated by 28% of Ontario public schools, as well as
student demographics and questionnaire data from Ontario&amp;rsquo;s Education
Quality and Accountability Office (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eqao.com/&#34;&gt;EQAO&lt;/a&gt;). The
main findings included in this report are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students begin interacting with computers at school from the
earliest grades, and access to the internet at school is all but
universal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is potentially a digital divide, linked with student family
incomes and remoteness of schools. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of learning technologies continues to vary considerably
among teachers. More recent learning technology innovations are
experimented depending on teacher&amp;rsquo;s own comfort levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of free, online resources is becoming popular. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-learning credit courses developed by the Ministry are not widely
used. Students in smaller schools are more likely to earn credits
through e-learning, as are students in the southwest and northern
regions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To read more about this report, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peopleforeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/digital-learning-2014-WEB.pdf&#34;&gt;click here

&lt;p&gt;When a friend requested me to share some tips on academic job search, I
realized it was the time to reflect on this unique journey of myself, or
at least to organize a reading list that has inspired my own search. So
here we go, a &lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;possibly biased&lt;/strong&gt;, reading list about
academic job search. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mhawksey&#34;&gt;Martin Hawksey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s
brilliant &lt;a href=&#34;http://mashe.hawksey.info/2013/02/twitter-archive-tagsv5/&#34;&gt;Google Spreadsheet
TAGS&lt;/a&gt; for
archiving Twitter data
for &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/2012/04/overview-of-aera2012-tweets/&#34;&gt;y&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/2012/10/225/&#34;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/2013/02/demo-of-using-twitter-hashtag-analytics-package-to-analyze-tweets-from-lak13/&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/2013/12/top-links-from-the-mooc-research-conference-twitter-backchannel-mri13/&#34;&gt;r&lt;/a&gt;-s.
It works very well, and allowed me to develop little R toys
like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dirkchen/twitterytics-shiny&#34;&gt;twitterytics-shiny&lt;/a&gt; to
interactively explore Twitter archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have a few complains. First, Twitter API authentication needs
to be set up for each archive. The task which require a few steps in
Google Spreadsheet is not trivial. Second, I often ended up getting
hundreds or even thousands of duplicates that may cause the file size to
exceed Google Spreadsheet&amp;rsquo;s size limit. Third, sometimes the getTweets()
function powered by Google Code (I think) fails for unknown reasons.
Although I still greatly enjoy TAGS, for these reasons I have been
wishing to have an easier and more liable way to archive theoretically
unlimited number of tweets for quite a while. So when I read a post
about *archiving tweets with
MongoDB* (&lt;a href=&#34;http://thinktostart.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/build-your-own-twitter-archive-and-analyzing-infrastructure-with-mongodb-java-and-r-part-1/&#34;&gt;part1&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;amp;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://thinktostart.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/build-your-own-twitter-archive-and-analyzing-infrastructure-with-mongodb-java-and-r-part-2/comment-page-1/#comment-448&#34;&gt;part2&lt;/a&gt;)
by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/julianhi&#34;&gt;Julian Hillebrand&lt;/a&gt; today, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
stop myself from trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mongoDB-logo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mongoDB-logo-1024x341.png&#34; alt=&#34;mongoDB-logo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JulianHill/TwitterArchive&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; works! But
after a bit playing and tweaking, I think the solution I ended up using
became quite distinctive and deserved an independent post. So below is
what I did, which I think contains some improvement over the original
solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup MongoDB
&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download MongoDB &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/downloads&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and
install it on your computer as Julian suggested. Or, you can using
MongoDB hosting services in the cloud, like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mongolab.com/&#34;&gt;MongoLab&lt;/a&gt;. I used the free subscription on
MongoLab. It was very easy to setup (believe me, this was my first time
partying with MongoDB), and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to install any other things
(like the Netbeans MongoDB plugin).  Plus, you might want to keep it
running when your laptop is off so it&amp;rsquo;s better to use something in the
cloud. So I strongly recommend MongoLab. If you choose to follow this
path, there&amp;rsquo;re around 3 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register&lt;/strong&gt; for a MongoLab free subscription&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a new database&lt;/strong&gt;, say &amp;ldquo;twitter-mongo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click into the database and &lt;strong&gt;add a database user&lt;/strong&gt;; record the
username/password for later use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will definitely help to read MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started-with-the-mongo-shell/&#34;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt;,
but I really got as far as the first page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup Java project and run the code
&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java code is used to retrieve tweets through Twitter API and save them
into MongoDB. Julian explained how his code works in details. I did some
tweaks to make the settings more visible and easier to modify. My code
is posted in this
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dirkchen/7885000&#34;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;. Download
TwitterLoop.java and do the following few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Java project&lt;/strong&gt; in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., Netbeans)
and put the Java file in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html#download&#34;&gt;twitter4j&lt;/a&gt; (core) and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/downloads&#34;&gt;mongodb-java-driver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Java file, &lt;strong&gt;change settings&lt;/strong&gt; for MongoDB and Twitter API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you should be able to directly run the Java file and start
collecting tweets. Each time when you run the file, you will need to
type in the search keyword (e.g. &amp;ldquo;#mri13&amp;rdquo;) for Twitter. Then the file
will repeatedly retrieve 100 tweets containing that keyword from Twitter
every 60 seconds (these two numbers can also be customized in the Java
file), and put new ones into MongoDB. Theoretically you can have Java
instances running forever. (As Julian mentioned, there should be a
better way to do this loop, for eaxmple using streaming API.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run the Java file twice for two different Twitter archives, say
&amp;ldquo;#mri13&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;#edtechchat&amp;rdquo;, two MongoDB *collections* will be created
respectively with these two names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrieve tweets in R from MongoDB for analysis
&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tweets are collected in MongoDB, querying data in R becomes very
straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
library(rmongodb)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;host-info-and-credentials&#34;&gt;Host info and credentials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;host &amp;lt;- &amp;ldquo;ds053858.mongolab.com:53858&amp;rdquo;
username &amp;lt;- &amp;ldquo;your_username&amp;rdquo;
password &amp;lt;- &amp;ldquo;your_pass&amp;rdquo;
db &amp;lt;- &amp;ldquo;twitter-mongo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;connect-to-mongodb&#34;&gt;Connect to mongodb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mongo &amp;lt;- mongo.create(host=host, db=db,
                      username=username, password=password)
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check how many collections are in the database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-a-list-of-collections-within-our-namespace&#34;&gt;Get a list of collections within our namespace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;here-i-used-each-collection-for-a-twitter-archive&#34;&gt;here I used each collection for a twitter archive&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mongo.get.database.collections(mongo, db)
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do some simple queries in the #mri13 collection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-string-that-points-to-the-namespace&#34;&gt;Create a string that points to the namespace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#  the collection I&amp;rsquo;m interested in is &amp;ldquo;#mri13&amp;rdquo;
collection &amp;lt;- &amp;ldquo;#mri13&amp;rdquo;
namespace &amp;lt;- paste(db, collection, sep=&amp;ldquo;.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;check-the-total-number-of-tweets-in-mri13&#34;&gt;Check the total number of tweets in &amp;ldquo;#mri13&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mongo.count(mongo, namespace, mongo.bson.empty())
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build a query to find how many tweets were posted by me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}
buf &amp;lt;- mongo.bson.buffer.create()
mongo.bson.buffer.append(buf, &amp;ldquo;user_name&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bodongchen&amp;rdquo;)
query &amp;lt;- mongo.bson.from.buffer(buf)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;get-the-count&#34;&gt;get the count&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;count &amp;lt;- mongo.count(mongo, namespace, query)
count
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-all-tweets-posted-by-me&#34;&gt;Get all tweets posted by me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tweets &amp;lt;- list()
cursor &amp;lt;- mongo.find(mongo, namespace, query)
while (mongo.cursor.next(cursor)) {
  val &amp;lt;- mongo.cursor.value(cursor)
  tweets[[length(tweets)+1]] &amp;lt;- mongo.bson.value(val, &amp;ldquo;tweet_text&amp;rdquo;)
}
length(tweets)
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrieve all tweets in this collection/archive as a dataframe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrieve-all-tweets-and-put-into-a-dataframe&#34;&gt;Retrieve all tweets and put into a dataframe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;library(plyr)
df_arch1 = data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
cursor &amp;lt;- mongo.find(mongo, namespace)
while (mongo.cursor.next(cursor)) {
  # iterate and grab the next record
  tmp = mongo.bson.to.list(mongo.cursor.value(cursor))
  # make it a dataframe
  tmp.df = as.data.frame(t(unlist(tmp)), stringsAsFactors = F)
  # bind to the master dataframe
  df_arch1 = rbind.fill(df_arch1, tmp.df)
}
dim(df_arch1)
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start playing with another collection/archive named &amp;ldquo;#edtechchat&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight r %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;try-with-another-collection&#34;&gt;Try with another collection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;collection2 &amp;lt;- &amp;ldquo;#edtechchat&amp;rdquo;
namespace2 &amp;lt;- paste(db, collection2, sep=&amp;ldquo;.&amp;rdquo;)
mongo.count(mongo, namespace2, mongo.bson.empty())
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The R code above is also included in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dirkchen/7885000&#34;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution brought together by MongoDB, Java, and R seems to me a
proof-of-concept of a reliable and scalable way to automatically archive
and analyze tweets. Here, Java can be easily replaced by Python or R. It
might evolve into a nice toolbox for hacking Twitter data. I believe
there will be a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.moocresearch.com/mooc-conference/program&#34;&gt;MOOC Research Conference&lt;/a&gt; has
just taken place at University of Texas, Arlington, December 5-6, 2013.
I was fortunate to be on board of one research project &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hatch,
Match, and Dispatch: Examining the relationship between student intent,
expectations, behaviours and outcomes in six Coursera MOOCs at the
University of Toronto&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; which was among the 20+
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.moocresearch.com/research-initiative/about&#34;&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; projects
participating in this MOOC Research Conference. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cteplovs&#34;&gt;Chris
Teplovs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/houshuang&#34;&gt;Stian
Håklev&lt;/a&gt; and Laurie Harrison from our team
attended the conference in person, and they were surprised by an
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dallas.eater.com/archives/2013/12/06/icepocalypse-happened-but-these-restaurants-are-open.php&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Icepocalyse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in that area. Some people said it might be because too many Canadians
were present at the conference (which is quite convincing :-P).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gsiemens/status/408176495572447232&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/gsiemens/status/408176495572447232&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I was not able to attend the conference, I had a lot of fun
following its
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;amp;q=%23mri13&#34;&gt;backchannel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; on
Twitter. The discussion took off one day before the conference (there
were pre-conference workshops) and climbed to its peak during the first
day, featured by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jimgroom&#34;&gt;Jim
Groom&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s keynote. The backchannel produced
a total of 1894 tweets, with 394 contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mri13.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mri13.png&#34; alt=&#34;mri13&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I am pulling together a list of top URLs (up until now) shared in this
discussion, just to highlight a few things I think that might be
interesting to think of. This is by no means to say there links
represent the key messages of the conference, but by reviewing them we
may get a glimpse of main issues discussed during the conference. These
top links are organized into a few themes below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/12/04/to-mooc-or-not-to-mooc/&#34;&gt;To MOOC or not to
MOOC?&lt;/a&gt;-
a blog post by Jonathan Rees [11 hits]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a history professor from Colorado State University and a guy who
thinks “MOOCs kinda suck”, Rees said, &amp;rdquo;&lt;em&gt;Yet it turns out that when
you put a bunch of MOOC enthusiasts in a conference together,
whatever orthodoxy that exists isn’t really all that far from
mine&amp;hellip; That said, what does set me apart from the rest of this
conference I think is a difference in priorities. Most of the
conversations were about the pitfalls of producing MOOCs. I wanted
to talk more about how universities that may use other schools’
MOOCs might consume them. Most of the people here are from
disciplines outside of the humanities, so I tried to explain that
what works in math or CS will not necessarily work for history,
especially history survey classes. While everyone seemed interested
in improving pedagogy, there was a kind of disturbing assumption
underlying all my discussions that any class that doesn’t use
technology is somehow broken by definition.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/what-problem-do-moocs-solve/&#34;&gt;What problem do MOOCs
solve? &lt;/a&gt;-
another blog post by Jonathan Rees [7 hits]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rees contended that, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;MOOCs threaten this kind of learning
[afforded by a very interactive and personalized teaching he has
been doing]. Yes, I know that we professors are supposed to use
MOOCs to flip our classrooms so that we can spend more time doing
exactly what I’m describing, but what will other students do all
class period when I’m providing personalized learning? When will
they have time to do the reading I assign if they’re watching all
those videos for homework? And, most importantly, how can I be sure
that my administration won’t just fire me and force students to fend
through a lot of taped lectures all by themselves?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also described his view about how MOOCs should work: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;In an
ideal world, MOOCs would supplement modern higher education rather
than replace it. We do not live in an ideal world. I’m not
suggesting that people with better motives stop innovating. What I
am suggesting is that they cannot innovate in a bubble. There is a
political economy of MOOCs that matters just as much as their
technological structure, especially for those of us who will never
teach in or learn from a MOOC over the course of their academic
careers.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides Simon&amp;rsquo;s post, this file contains links to breakout group
discussion around learning analytics in MOOCs, which was identified
as one of the key challenges to be addressed. This file also
contains links to discussion summaries of the other two
challenges: &lt;em&gt;Organizational challenges to MOOC development and
delivery&lt;/em&gt;; and &lt;em&gt;Systemic challenges with MOOCs: competency-based
learning, credit &amp;amp; credentialing&lt;/em&gt;. (It&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat to have such a
file, although some notes may not make sense to you.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m personally glad to see people from the learning analytics
community present in the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CORDTRA (Chronologically-Ordered Representation of Discourse and
Tool-Related Activity) is a visualization technique proposed by Cindy
Hmelo-Silver (2003) for interpreting collaborative learning processes,
based on Luckin et al.&amp;rsquo;s CORDFU (Chronologically-Ordered Representation
of Discourse and Features Used). This technique could provide a holistic
view of learning processes by making temporal relationship among various
types of learning activities visible. By presenting a few interesting
case studies, Hmelo-Silver and colleagues (2003, 2008) demonstrate that
CORDTRA could provide useful insights about student interactions in
computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed description of CORDTRA could be found in Hmelo-Silver and her
colleagues&amp;rsquo; articles. The general idea of this visualization is to first
sort discourse units chronologically and put them on an X axis, and then
map interested coding results (or log information) of discourse onto the
axis, with each coding category represented as a horizontal line. In
this way, researchers could inspect the representation visually and look
for possible relations among discourse events pertinent to their
research questions. Here is an example of a CORDTRA diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0360131503000812-gr3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;CORDTRA
example&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cordtra-shiny-app&#34;&gt;CORDTRA Shiny App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on data analysis of my doctoral research, which involves various
types of student activities in Knowledge Forum, I decided to give this
technique a try. According to Cindy, they used Excel to create CORDTRA
diagrams. They could zoom into a timeline to study events around a
certain period of time in detail. This is pretty handy! But at the same
time I heard complains about the complexity of the task of creating a
CORDTRA diagram from colleagues who incorporated it in their research. I
could imagine that customizing shapes of dots in an Excel diagram is not
always easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nise81.com/archives/2202&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about
creating CORDTRA diagrams with D3.js, I thought it might be a good idea
to develop a simple R-based program that could effortlessly convert
coded CSCL data into a CORDTRA diagram. So here we are, &lt;a href=&#34;http://glimmer.rstudio.com/bodong/CORDTRA-R&#34;&gt;a Shiny
app&lt;/a&gt; (based on R) for
creating CORDTRA diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this app asks for is only a spreadsheet containing sorted discourse
units and their coding results. The first few lines of the spreadsheet I
use for demo look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/cordtra-data.png&#34; alt=&#34;CORDTRA
diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first column of the table contains indices of discourse units. (In
my case, discourse units are Knowledge Forum notes.) The other four
columns contain coding results of four coding schemes, including &lt;em&gt;Ways
of contributing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Levels of problems&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scientific sophistication&lt;/em&gt;, and
&lt;em&gt;Epistemic complexity&lt;/em&gt;. They are categorical or ordinal data, with each
category or level of them representing a certain interested event in my
research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;http://glimmer.rstudio.com/bodong/CORDTRA-R/&#34;&gt;the Shiny app&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve
developed, this table can be automatically transformed to a CORDTRA
diagram like below. In this diagram, each coding scheme, which maps to
each table column, has a distinctive color, and each category under a
coding scheme is represented by a specific shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/cordtra.png&#34; alt=&#34;CORDTRA
diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app also allows researchers to zoom in/out the diagram by selecting
range of discourse units to be visualized. It also enables researchers
to filter certain coding categories by deselecting them on the left
panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps-further&#34;&gt;Steps further&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many way to interpret a CORDTRA visualization. Beside visual
interpretation, one analysis researchers may wish to do is to check
co-occurrence of certain types of events. To facilitate this analysis,
this Shiny app extracts a co-occurrence matrix of all coding categories,
and visualize it as a force-directed map (see below). The following
visualization may not be the best example to show the power of this
functionality, because the only fruitfulness of it is showing that we&amp;rsquo;ve
coded &lt;em&gt;scientific sophistication&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;theorizing&lt;/em&gt;
notes and &lt;em&gt;depth of questions&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;questioning&lt;/em&gt; notes. But if you have
a richer set of coding schemes, interesting patterns which are hard to
inspect in CORDTRA may become visible in the visualization of
co-occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/cordtra-cooccurrence.png&#34; alt=&#34;CORDTRA
map&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another direction I wish to take is to make this diagram more
interactive. Thanks to the googleVis R package, it becomes possible to
integrate Google Charts into a Shiny app. I started by playing with the
Google Motion Chart&amp;mdash;a cool visualization that could show change of
objects overtime. Probably the most famous example of this visualization
is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty.html&#34;&gt;Hans Rosling&amp;rsquo;s TED
talk&lt;/a&gt;
about poverty and world economy. In this app, because I don&amp;rsquo;t have
enough numeric data to feed to x and y axises, it could only track
accumulated occurrence of each coding category. If student/author
information of each discourse unit is available, it might become
possible to create aggregated information around students to visualize
and compare certain aspect of discourse performance of all students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/cordtra-motion.png&#34; alt=&#34;motion

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;In an earlier &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/?p=301&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; I played
with the idea of visualizing Knowledge Forum discourse in a 2D space, to
support one specific perspective of community knowledge focusing on
semantic similarity/distance among contributions. I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://lsa.colorado.edu/whatis.html&#34;&gt;Latent
Semantic Analysis&lt;/a&gt; (LSA) for
similarity computation and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling&#34;&gt;Multidimensional
scaling&lt;/a&gt; (MDS)
for dimensionality reduction. The results was interesting, with notes
around a same topic generally clustered together. However, as one
colleague pointed out in a comment, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to interpret topics around
different clusters and it would be nice if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to inspect
clusters and somehow label them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cscl2013.isls.org/&#34;&gt;CSCL 2013 conference&lt;/a&gt; around ten days
ago I attended an interactive presentation by Norma Ming. In her work,
she conducted &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_latent_semantic_analysis&#34;&gt;probabilistic
LSA&lt;/a&gt;
(pLSA) on four weeks of online discussion by college students in a
biology class and extracted 100 topics for the dataset. After pLSA, the
semantic space of the online discussion could be represented by a
100-dimensional space, with each post represented by a 100-dimensional
vector. To visualize all posts on a 2D space, locally linear embedding
(LLE) was further conducted, reducing the 100-dimensional space to 2D
while keeping locally clustered posts in the high dimensional space
still close in the 2D space. With posts visualized in a 2D canvas, Norma
further mapped students&amp;rsquo; scores of the final exam as well as week # of
discussion onto the visualization. Interestingly, they found students
achieving higher scores tended to contribute more posts in &amp;ldquo;outer
space&amp;rdquo;, while low-achieving students&amp;rsquo; posts only covered the central
area. With course week information, they found quite clear boundaries
among discussion of different weeks, although over-plotting might be an
issue as you see in the following figure from their paper. These results
were pretty powerful, especially if we don&amp;rsquo;t only think retrospectively
but also prospectively. For example, whether is it possible to guide
students to &amp;ldquo;outer space&amp;rdquo; by progressively represent their discussion in
this way to encourage &amp;ldquo;metadiscourse&amp;rdquo; (namely, discourse about
discourse)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/norma-plsa.png&#34; alt=&#34;norma&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back from CSCL, I resumed the work of representing semantic space
of Knowledge Forum discussion for metadiscourse. Rather than using pLSA,
I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation&#34;&gt;latent Dirichlet
allocation&lt;/a&gt;
(LDA), a more sophisticated technique for topic modeling. The key idea
is similar to Norma&amp;rsquo;s work, which is to represent discourse in a
high-dimensional space and then reduce it to 2D for visualization. &lt;a href=&#34;http://glimmer.rstudio.com/bodong/topicmodels&#34;&gt;A
Shiny app&lt;/a&gt; was developed
as a proof of concept. It has three main functionalities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I. Visualization of semantic space. The visualization is implemented
with a Google (&amp;ldquo;non-moving Motion&amp;rdquo;) Chart, which allows users to
interact with the visualization. Users can easily change x and y axises
as well as the meaning of color and size of dots in the visualization to
help interpret the results. It provides a potentially powerful way to
interact with data if the data have a rich set of variables. Further,
zooming in functionality is available if an area is cluttered with too
many dots so the problem of over-plotting could be alleviated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/topicmodels-vis.png&#34; alt=&#34;topicmodels
visualization&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​II. Summary of extracted topics. Top words of each extracted topic are
listed to help users interpret the results. Users can choose to show
more (or less) top words in the process of making sense of a topic.
Moreover, numbers of notes under topics are also provided, to help
identify popular topics. It opens the door to further tracking
popularity of topics in a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/topicmodels-topics.png&#34; alt=&#34;topicmodels
topics&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​III. Detailed content of notes. Detailed content of notes are also
presented for users to make sense of the results and to decide whether
the topic modeling results are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/topicmodels-notes.png&#34; alt=&#34;topicmodels
notes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This application is a first step of my exploration of visualizing
students&amp;rsquo; online discourse to facilitate metadiscourse. I plan to
introduce more variables such as authorship, timestamp, and various
types of coding results into this visualization in the future. &lt;strong&gt;Please
let me know if you wish to explore any idea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in a wonderful full-day workshop about Epistemic
Network Analysis (ENA), which I had been wishing to learn for a long
time. David and Gol did a great job explaining its theoretical
background, walking through a bunch of mathematical computation behind
it, and doing some interesting demos with some real data from their
research project. I had a great time playing with the sample data with
my &amp;ldquo;teammate&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/OhMissAcosta&#34;&gt;Alisa&lt;/a&gt;, and will
definitely apply it on some Knowledge Forum data in the near future.
It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting that the system is based on R, and it makes me
seriously thinking about the possibility of building KF analytics on R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.edgaps.org/gaps/wp-content/uploads/ENA_logo_web_sm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ENA&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am posting my notes below. For more information about the workshop,
check &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isls.org/cscl2013/pre-conference-sessions.html&#34;&gt;conference
website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/dws1d/lak-05&#34;&gt;David&amp;rsquo;s slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;theoretical-background-of-ena&#34;&gt;Theoretical background of ENA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its roots in research of epistemic games. Show video about the
epistemic game for engineering education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data mining &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Data geology (data mining is a problematic term;
have to understand the underline structure before digging into the
data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need for 21st century thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;community of knowledge &amp;mdash;| culture, knowledge, skills, values,
identity; shared epistemology is important for a community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shawn&amp;rsquo;s research on creative community; reflection-on-action (pretty
inspiring for my work on promisingness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ENA aims to understand the structure of skills, knowledge, identity,
values and epistemology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go beyond psychometrics work focusing on specific skills. this tool
is generic, can be applied to anyplace where network (of coding
categories / epistemic frames) is more important rather than
individual components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;explanation-of-the-tool-focusing-on-mathematical-stuff-behind-it&#34;&gt;Explanation of the tool, focusing on mathematical stuff behind it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get chat discourse from the engineering epistemic game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code each utterance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;validate (alpha scores)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coded data ready &amp;ndash; matrix, binary (rather than proportional data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define stanza &amp;ndash; this concept is very important, because it will
decide how co-occurrences occur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build adjacency matrix, based on collapsing coding results in a same
stanza&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build adjacency vector, converted from adjacency matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decide the unit of analysis - student, group of students, or else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collapse stanzas for each unit of analysis, to get vectors for each
unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vectors represented by their directions, rather than positions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dimensional reduction (SVD) &amp;ndash; similar to Principal Component
Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each unit represented in a 3D space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making sense of reduced dimensions &amp;ndash; loading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this tool will not allow the analyzer to see a final position of
each unit, but also its development trajectory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What assumptions are made in the stanza compression process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if frequency of epistemic frames are different? (also asked by
another participant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the analysis of math discourse we are doing, counting appearance
of different types of vocabs in students&amp;rsquo; utterance will basically
give coded data of students&amp;rsquo; mathematical thinking. And then the
tool can be applied. It will also be interesting to see the links
between mathematical thinking and KB contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to see evolution of thinking is interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://epistemicgames.org/ena/&#34;&gt;Link to the ENA tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project started from Excel, and now its backend is based on R,
and front-end visualizations are based on JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csv or R data; can be exported as R data to be further explored in
RStudio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions and comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the larger number of plots to look at, how to find the most
helpful plot?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David: the reduced dimensions are ordered already by the
percentage of variance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This whole system is backed by R. Interesting way to develop LA
systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation-by-chandra-orrill-university-of-massachusetts-dartmouth&#34;&gt;Presentation by Chandra Orrill, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General intro&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work a lot on math education; focusing on teacher&amp;rsquo;s professional
development; proportional reasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diSessa&amp;rsquo;s knowledge in pieces as hypothesis of her research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;novice vs. expert teachers; experts focus on big ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;importance of knowledge coherence for teachers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interview data of teachers about proportional reasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 teachers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data coding

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ratio concepts: iteration, ideas of growth, invariance,
ratio-as-measure, ration calculation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fraction concepts: &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem solving: problem interpretation, verify math is correct,
attend to context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Representation: interpretation diagram, validate representation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other math ideas: &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;different patterns for different levels of teachers (stronger,
middle, weaker)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding more items (concepts?) into analysis will change results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to start small &amp;ndash; know data better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not to be over-generous when coding &amp;ndash; be more strict when doing.
&amp;ldquo;Do I see &amp;hellip; in this unit?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deal with codes that confound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where I can access the R code that is used in RStudio?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a proper stanza for typical interview data? (Her answer is
&amp;ndash; in her case, each teacher was asked to talk about a series of
items. and discussion about one item was treated as a stanza. that
makes sense!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example of analyzing Common Core standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Important to make data reproducible; can go back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be thoughtful in defining metadata, which is very useful for
reproducing or reconstructing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Today I was attending &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.knaer-recrae.ca/knowledge-mobilization/events/item/161-seeing-what-is-before-us-the-use-of-data-visualization&#34;&gt;a data visualization
workshop&lt;/a&gt;
organized by the KNAER Data Visualization project in collaboration with
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aero-aoce.org/&#34;&gt;AERO&lt;/a&gt;. I was one of the presenters,
including Paul Anisef, Rob Brown, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cconley.ca/&#34;&gt;Chris Conley&lt;/a&gt; and
Cosmin Marmureanu. It was the first time I met with them in person
although we have been working together for a few months already on data
visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop went quite well, with around 60 participants mostly from
school boards and the ministry of education. Rob started by introducing
the history of this data visualization project. After that, Chris took
over and gave a nice introduction to a number of important principles of
data visualization. Then he guided everybody working through a few neat
data visualization techinques in Excel, including pyramid chart, slope
chart, thermometer chart, and interactive charts. As a person who mainly
used Excel for bar charts when coming to data visualization, it was
amazing to learn those new techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Excel session was done, Cosmin who has been working
extensively on GIS visualization of educational data introduced us to a
few mapping tools including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/drive/start/apps.html#fusiontables&#34;&gt;Google Fusion
Tables&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arcgis.com/&#34;&gt;ArcGIS&lt;/a&gt; and Quantum GIS. Putting data on top of
maps could become really powerful as I saw at &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/?p=285&#34;&gt;the Toronto Open Data Day
event&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago. Mashing up
educational data on top of maps could provide fresh ways of looking at
the data that cannot be found elsewhere, and could help communicate
information strongly to impact planning and policy making. However,
interpreting information from a map is always tricky and needs special
caution, because there is always rich information behind or attached to
the map and either the presenters or the audience could easily become
biased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I led a session focusing on data visualization with
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time I was giving a
presentation solely focusing on R since I learned it last year in a
course on Coursera. It was also the first time to present to an audience
mainly from school boards. So the experience was quite interesting. As
most of the participants were not familiar with R, I tried to make
everything simple and straightforward, building visualizations step by
step by adding one new element each time. The presentation mainly
focused on &lt;a href=&#34;http://ggplot2.org/&#34;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt;, and briefly mentioned
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/&#34;&gt;Shiny&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://yihui.name/knitr/&#34;&gt;knitr&lt;/a&gt; at the end. By showing what you can do
with only one line of code in R, I was trying to convey how powerful and
flexible R could become especially in exploring data. The demo I did
mainly focused on some ordinary data visualization techniques such as
barplot, boxplot, histogram, and scatterplot. I also included a few
slides about data manipulation and transformation in R as well as more
advanced stuff like heatmaps and geographic maps. After this demo was
done, Chris showed how to make venn diagram and &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/motionchart&#34;&gt;Google motion
chart&lt;/a&gt;
in R, which was very cool. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/slides/knaer-workshop/&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/dirkchen/knaer-workshop&#34;&gt;handout&lt;/a&gt; online. (They
themselves were written with R in &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/slides/knaer-workshop/index.Rmd&#34;&gt;this
file&lt;/a&gt; and
compiled into slides with &lt;a href=&#34;http://ramnathv.github.com/slidify/&#34;&gt;Slidify&lt;/a&gt;
and to handout with knitr.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left the day after Paul wrapped up the workshop discussing future
possibilities of this project and knowledge mobilization work to be
done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyze Text Similarity with R: Latent Semantic Analysis and Multidimentional Scaling</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most pressing questions I have been pondering upon when
redesigning &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.knowledgeforum.com/&#34;&gt;Knowledge Forum&lt;/a&gt; is how to
represent the knowledge space of a community to better support idea
improvement. Many people think Knowledge Forum as another discussion
forum (or learning management system) with a 2-D interface (see below).
This notion lead people to treat a Knowledge Forum &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; merely as a
container of &lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt;. The reason why this happens is because users
usually fail to recognize one important principle behind the design of
Knowledge Forum &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt;: to support &lt;em&gt;multiple perspectives&lt;/em&gt; of community
knowledge. According to this principle, a view should not be a container
of notes, but provides a specific perspective that helps people work on
ideas in those notes. Although current Knowledge Forum tries to embody
this principle in its functionalities, such as flexible movements of
notes across views, the representation of knowledge within a view still
rigidly depends on placement of notes by users. As a result, it puts too
much burden on users to achieve the goal of perceiving or discovering
&lt;em&gt;multiple perspectives&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, how could we design techniques to
provide additional perspectives of knowledge presents to be an
interesting challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.knowledgeforum.com/Kforum/Images/Pic2_4_6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Knowledge Forum view and
notes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embarking on this challenge, I started to think maybe the first
alternative perspective I could work on is semantic relations among
&lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt; in a &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt;. The idea is simple. Given a bunch of notes in a
view, put those semantically similar ones together so users could more
easily discern different semantic territories in this view and work more
productively with ideas. (I am sure I am reinventing the wheel here, so
it will be great if you can point me to any relevant resources.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am demoing a “toy” (made with R) that presents my
initial endeavor to solve this problem. Using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis&#34;&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis
(LSA)&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lsa/index.html&#34;&gt;its
R package&lt;/a&gt;), I
could analyze relationships between a set of notes based on what words
and latently similar words they share. Then using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling&#34;&gt;mutidimentional
scaling (MDS)&lt;/a&gt;, a
statistical technique for exploring similarities I just learned last
week, I could scale and visualize note similarities on a 2- or 3-D
space. The goal, as explained above, is to provide users an alternative
perspective of their knowledge space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I am describing steps of analysis of the prototypic tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;prepare-mock-data&#34;&gt;Prepare mock data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need some mock data that show some semantic diversity. In this
case, I am making up 9 notes about three topics: food, electricity, and
birds. After a few typical text mining processes, such as stopwords
removal and stemming, we have a corpus ready to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# load required libraries
library(tm)
library(ggplot2)
library(lsa)

# 1. Prepare mock data
text &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;transporting food by cars will cause global warming. so we should go local.&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;we should try to convince our parents to stop using cars because it will cause global warming.&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;some food, such as mongo, requires a warm weather to grow. so they have to be transported to canada.&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;a typical electronic circuit can be built with a battery, a bulb, and a switch.&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;electricity flows from batteries to the bulb, just like water flows through a tube.&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;batteries have chemical energe in it. then electrons flow through a bulb to light it up.&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;birds can fly because they have feather and they are light.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;why some birds like pigeon can fly while some others like chicken cannot?&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;feather is important for birds&#39; fly. if feather on a bird&#39;s wings is removed, this bird cannot fly.&amp;quot;)
view &amp;lt;- factor(rep(c(&amp;quot;view 1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;view 2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;view 3&amp;quot;), each = 3))
df &amp;lt;- data.frame(text, view, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# prepare corpus
corpus &amp;lt;- Corpus(VectorSource(df$text))
corpus &amp;lt;- tm_map(corpus, tolower)
corpus &amp;lt;- tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
corpus &amp;lt;- tm_map(corpus, function(x) removeWords(x, stopwords(&amp;quot;english&amp;quot;)))
corpus &amp;lt;- tm_map(corpus, stemDocument, language = &amp;quot;english&amp;quot;)
corpus  # check corpus

## A corpus with 9 text documents
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mds-with-raw-term-document-matrix&#34;&gt;MDS with raw term-document matrix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this corpus, we can compute a term-document matrix that contains
occurrance of terms in each note. As a starting point, we can then
compute distance between pairs of documents and scale the
multidimentional semantic space onto two dimensions. Results of scaling
are plotted on a graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# 2. MDS with raw term-document matrix compute distance matrix
td.mat &amp;lt;- as.matrix(TermDocumentMatrix(corpus))
dist.mat &amp;lt;- dist(t(as.matrix(td.mat)))
dist.mat  # check distance matrix

##       1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8
## 2 2.828
## 3 3.000 3.873
## 4 3.742 4.000 3.873
## 5 4.000 4.243 4.123 3.464
## 6 3.742 4.000 3.873 2.828 2.828
## 7 3.317 3.606 3.464 3.317 3.606 3.000
## 8 3.317 3.606 3.464 3.317 3.606 3.317 2.000
## 9 5.099 5.292 5.196 5.099 5.292 5.099 3.000 3.606


# MDS
fit &amp;lt;- cmdscale(dist.mat, eig = TRUE, k = 2)
points &amp;lt;- data.frame(x = fit$points[, 1], y = fit$points[, 2])
ggplot(points, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(data = points, aes(x = x, y = y,
    color = df$view)) + geom_text(data = points, aes(x = x, y = y - 0.2, label = row.names(df)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/mds-row.png&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk
mds-row&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are acceptable, given those notes under the same topic seem
to be close to each other. Three clusters of notes mapping with three
topics emerged, although note 9 is a bit far off on the x dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mds-with-lsa&#34;&gt;MDS with LSA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With LSA, we can go one step further by taking latent similarity between
notes into consideration. This technique is expected to be much superior
to using raw term-document matrix because, as you see in the code, it
does additional weighting and is able to find latent links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# 3. MDS with LSA
td.mat.lsa &amp;lt;- lw_bintf(td.mat) * gw_idf(td.mat)  # weighting
lsaSpace &amp;lt;- lsa(td.mat.lsa)  # create LSA space
dist.mat.lsa &amp;lt;- dist(t(as.textmatrix(lsaSpace)))  # compute distance matrix
dist.mat.lsa  # check distance mantrix

##         1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8

## 6  9.0802 12.6645 12.3715  2.4007  1.7214
## 7  7.6546 11.6848 11.3666  8.7133  6.3557  6.7759
## 8  7.5055 11.5876 11.2667  9.0778  6.6877  7.2384  0.6671
## 9  9.0005 12.6075 12.3132 10.5855  8.3089  8.4643  2.1678  2.2945


# MDS
fit &amp;lt;- cmdscale(dist.mat.lsa, eig = TRUE, k = 2)
points &amp;lt;- data.frame(x = fit$points[, 1], y = fit$points[, 2])
ggplot(points, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(data = points, aes(x = x, y = y,
    color = df$view)) + geom_text(data = points, aes(x = x, y = y - 0.2, label = row.names(df)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/mds-lsa.png&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk
mds-lsa&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are quite different from what we got with the raw
term-document matrix. While notes under view 2 and 3 become more tightly
clustered together, three notes under view 1 get stretched on the y
coordinate. Comparing the distance matrix based on LSA with the one
based on raw term-document matrix, I realized the distance among note
1-3 got significantly increased after LSA. I am not sure how exactly
this has happened, and this issue could get even more complicated when
we have dozens of notes to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will it be better if we could plot scaling results in 3D?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(scatterplot3d)
fit &amp;lt;- cmdscale(dist.mat.lsa, eig = TRUE, k = 3)
colors &amp;lt;- rep(c(&amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;green&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;), each = 3)
scatterplot3d(fit$points[, 1], fit$points[, 2], fit$points[, 3], color = colors,
    pch = 16, main = &amp;quot;Semantic Space Scaled to 3D&amp;quot;, xlab = &amp;quot;x&amp;quot;, ylab = &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;,
    zlab = &amp;quot;z&amp;quot;, type = &amp;quot;h&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/rds-3d.png&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk
rds-3d&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really, the first three notes still show some great variance on the
y axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extending-to-twitter-analysis&#34;&gt;Extending to Twitter analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/?p=290&#34;&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; about Twitter
hashtag analytics, we can test this technique with tweets aggregated by
a same hashtag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;setwd(&amp;quot;~/src/r/twitter-analytics/twitter-hashtag-analytics&amp;quot;)
source(&amp;quot;utilities.R&amp;quot;)
source(&amp;quot;get_tweets.R&amp;quot;)
source(&amp;quot;munge_tweets.R&amp;quot;)
source(&amp;quot;semantic_analysis.R&amp;quot;)

# get tweets from #LAK13
lak13 &amp;lt;- GetTweetsBySearch(&#39;#LAK13&#39;, 500)
lak13 &amp;lt;- PreprocessTweets(lak13)
corpus &amp;lt;- ConstructCorpus(lak13$text, removeTags=TRUE, removeUsers=TRUE, stemming=TRUE)

# compute distance matrix
td.mat &amp;lt;- as.matrix(TermDocumentMatrix(corpus))
td.mat.lsa &amp;lt;- lw_bintf(td.mat) * gw_idf(td.mat) # weighting
lsaSpace &amp;lt;- lsa(td.mat.lsa) # create LSA space
dist.mat.lsa &amp;lt;- dist(t(as.textmatrix(lsaSpace))) # compute distance matrix

# MDS
fit &amp;lt;- cmdscale(dist.mat.lsa, eig=TRUE, k=2)
points &amp;lt;- data.frame(x=fit$points[, 1], y=fit$points[, 2])
qplot(x, y, data = points, geom = &amp;quot;point&amp;quot;, alpha = I(1/5))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/rds-twitter.png&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk
rds-twitter&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This search retrieves 98 tweets. A few clusters emerged, showing heated
discussion seemingly around the topic in the middle. Because &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;
does not support interactivity on the plot, it is hard to tell what
those topics are about. But it will be easy to export the results into a
&lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; object that can be consumed by tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://d3js.org/&#34;&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt;
to produce powerful visualizations with interaction capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/benmarwick/AAA2011-Tweets&#34;&gt;Ben Marwick&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/01/tags-r/&#34;&gt;Martin Hawksey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ouseful.info/2012/01/21/a-quick-view-over-a-mashe-google-spreadsheet-twitter-archive-of-ukgc2012-tweets/&#34;&gt;Tony
Hirst&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s
work on analyzing tweets with R, I started an R project for tweet
analysis, namely
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dirkchen/twitter-hashtag-analytics&#34;&gt;twitter-hashtag-analytics&lt;/a&gt;.
This project is hosted on Github and welcomes anyone who&amp;rsquo;s interested to
contribute. It is my very first attempt to write a package in R, so I
admit the capabilities of it is still limited and its structure may be
not properly planned. Any advice will be highly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demo, drafted with &lt;a href=&#34;http://yihui.name/knitr/&#34;&gt;knitr&lt;/a&gt;, aims to show
the functionality of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dirkchen/twitter-hashtag-analytics&#34;&gt;twitter-hashtag-analytics&lt;/a&gt;
and also available on Github. It will evlove along with this project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-preparation&#34;&gt;Data Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting to analyze tweets, we will first load a few source files
(libraries) in this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# check working directory
getwd()

# note that Knitr automatically sets wd to where the Rmd file is.  so if
# you wish to run code line-by-line, you should setwd mannually.
# setwd(&#39;/home/bodong/src/r/twitter-analytics/twitter-hashtag-analytics&#39;)

# load source files
source(&amp;quot;get_tweets.R&amp;quot;)
source(&amp;quot;munge_tweets.R&amp;quot;)
source(&amp;quot;utilities.R&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can retrieve a Twitter hashtag dataset by searching through
Twitter API. Two other methods of retriving tweets implemented in this
project so far include &lt;strong&gt;retriving from Google Spreadsheet archives&lt;/strong&gt;
(see &lt;a href=&#34;http://mashe.hawksey.info/2013/02/twitter-archive-tagsv5/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
and &lt;strong&gt;reading directly from a CSV file&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# get tweets by search
# this function is defined in get_tweets.R
df &amp;lt;- GetTweetsBySearch(&#39;#LAK13&#39;)

# save or load data (so you can reuse data rather than search all the time)
save(df, file=&amp;quot;./data/df.Rda&amp;quot;)
# load(&amp;quot;./data/df.Rda&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dataset contains 108 tweets posted by 52 unique Twitter users
between 2013-02-19 and 2013-02-26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because tweet information retrieved through twitteR is kind of limited
(see its &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html&#34;&gt;reference
manual&lt;/a&gt;, p.
11), we need to extract user information, such as &lt;code&gt;reply_to_user&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;retweet_from_user&lt;/code&gt;, mannually from each tweet. At the same time, the
names of metadata in twitteR are quite different from those used in the
official Twitter API, the following &lt;code&gt;PreprocessTweets&lt;/code&gt; function in
&lt;code&gt;munge_tweets.R&lt;/code&gt; also renames some attributes of tweets. Moreover, the
&lt;code&gt;PreprocessTweets&lt;/code&gt; function also trims urls in tweets and put them in a
new column named &lt;code&gt;links&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# preprocessing
df &amp;lt;- PreprocessTweets(df)

# structure of df
str(df)

&lt;h3 id=&#34;count-tweets-retweets-by-and-replies-to-for-each-user&#34;&gt;Count tweets, retweets (by), and replies (to) for each user&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular statuses, retweets, and replies are three main types of tweets
we analyze. The &lt;code&gt;GetTweetCountTable&lt;/code&gt; function can easily count total
tweets sent by a user, times of retweeting by other users, and number of
replies a user has received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require(ggplot2)
require(reshape2)

# Count tables

countRetweets &amp;lt;- GetTweetCountTable(df, &amp;quot;retweet_from&amp;quot;)
countReplies &amp;lt;- GetTweetCountTable(df, &amp;quot;reply_to&amp;quot;)

# quickly check distribution of tweets per user
qplot(countTweets$count, binwidth = 1, xlab = &amp;quot;Number of Tweets&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ratio-of-retweets-to-tweets&#34;&gt;Ratio of retweets to tweets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a sense how received or valued one&amp;rsquo;s tweets were within the
community, we can further count the ratio of being retweeted by other
users to sent tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# create new column &#39;ratio&#39;
counts$ratio &amp;lt;- counts$retweeted_by/counts$tweets

# plot ratio for users who have at least one rt
ggplot(counts[counts$retweeted_by &amp;gt; 0, ], aes(x = reorder(user, ratio), y = ratio)) +
    geom_point() + coord_flip() + ggtitle(&amp;quot;Ratio of retweets to tweets&amp;quot;) + xlab(&amp;quot;Users&amp;quot;) +
    ylab(&amp;quot;Retweets/Tweets ratio&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;count-urls&#34;&gt;Count URLs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URLs embedded in tweets are important because they usually link to
important resources that are of interest to this community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# count links
countLinks &amp;lt;- GetTweetCountTable(df, &amp;quot;links&amp;quot;)

&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-network-analysis-sna&#34;&gt;Social Network Analysis (SNA)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;visualize-social-networks&#34;&gt;Visualize social networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An archived tweet dataset contains &lt;code&gt;retweeting&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;replying&lt;/code&gt; as two
main type of links among users. Some studies looks into &lt;code&gt;following&lt;/code&gt;
relations, which require further queries to Twitter. So in this demo, we
focus on &lt;code&gt;retweeting&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;replying&lt;/code&gt; links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;CreateSNADataFrame&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;social_analysis.R&lt;/code&gt; provides an
easy way to create a data frame containing all edges of the requested
social network. With created edges, we can easily create an SNA graph
and visualize it with packages like &lt;code&gt;igraph&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sna&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# load source file first
source(&amp;quot;social_analysis.R&amp;quot;)

# create data frame
rt.df &amp;lt;- CreateSNADataFrame(df, from = &amp;quot;from_user&amp;quot;, to = &amp;quot;retweet_from&amp;quot;, linkNames = &amp;quot;rt&amp;quot;)
rp.df &amp;lt;- CreateSNADataFrame(df, from = &amp;quot;from_user&amp;quot;, to = &amp;quot;reply_to&amp;quot;, linkNames = &amp;quot;rp&amp;quot;)

# begin social network analysis plotting
require(igraph)
require(sna)
require(Matrix)
require(SparseM)

# create graph data frame (igraph)
g &amp;lt;- graph.data.frame(rt.df, directed = TRUE)

# plot with igraph (quick and dirty)
plot.igraph(g)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/sna1.png&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk
sna&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# plot with sna get adjacency matrix
mat &amp;lt;- get.adjacency(g)
# convert to csr matrix provided by SparseM ref:
# http://cos.name/cn/topic/108758
mat.csr &amp;lt;- as.matrix.csr(mat, ncol = ncol(mat))

# plot with sna
gplot(mat.csr)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/sna2.png&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk
sna&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-sna-measures&#34;&gt;Basic SNA measures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can further compute some basic SNA measures. For instance, density of
this network is 0.027, reciprocity of users in the network is 0.9488,
and degree centralization of this network is 0.2425. These measures are
calculated as below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# density
gden(mat.csr)

## [1] 0.02703


# reciprocity
grecip(mat.csr)

##    Mut
## 0.9488


# centralization
centralization(mat.csr, sna::degree)

## [1] 0.2425
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;community-detection&#34;&gt;Community detection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A regular task in SNA is to identify communities in a network. We can do
it through the &lt;code&gt;walktrap.community&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;igraph&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;g.wc &amp;lt;- walktrap.community(g, steps = 1000, modularity = TRUE)

# number of communities
length(g.wc)

## [1] 7

# sizes of communities
sizes(g.wc)

## Community sizes
##  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
##  3  5 23  2  2  2  1

# plot
plot(as.dendrogram(g.wc))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/detectcommunity.png&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk
detectcommunity&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have detected 7 communities in this network. The largest community
contains 44.231% of all users in this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;univariate-conditional-uniform-graph-tests&#34;&gt;Univariate Conditional Uniform Graph Tests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In network analysis, people do types of tests to check whether some
aspects of a network are &lt;em&gt;unusual&lt;/em&gt;. We can do such tests, namely
&lt;em&gt;conditional uniform graph tests&lt;/em&gt;, through the &lt;code&gt;cug.test&lt;/code&gt; function in
the &lt;code&gt;sna&lt;/code&gt; package. Further information about these tests can be found
&lt;a href=&#34;http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/r-help/library/sna/html/cug.test.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;words&#34;&gt;Words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, make a word cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# load source file first
source(&amp;quot;semantic_analysis.R&amp;quot;)

# construct corpus, with regular preprocessing performed
corpus &amp;lt;- ConstructCorpus(df$text, removeTags = TRUE, removeUsers = TRUE)

# make a word cloud
MakeWordCloud(corpus)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7599158/wp/figure/wordcloud.png&#34; alt=&#34;plot of chunk
wordcloud&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This task first uses &lt;code&gt;ConstructCorpus&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;semantic_analysis.R&lt;/code&gt; to
create a text corpus, and then uses &lt;code&gt;MakeWordCloud&lt;/code&gt; to make a word
cloud. Please note that &lt;code&gt;ConstructCorpus&lt;/code&gt; provides a number of options
such as whether to remove hashtags (#tag) or users (@user) embedded in
tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we are going to create a term-document matrix for some quick
similarity computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# create a term document matrix only keep tokens longer than three
# characters
td.mat &amp;lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(corpus, control = list(minWordLength = 3))
# have a quick look
td.mat

## Sparsity           : 98%
## Maximal term length: 17

##     using
##      0.59
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more advanced similarity computation among documents and terms, I am
considering adding Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) capability into this
package in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;topic-modelling-with-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda&#34;&gt;Topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the sparse term-document matrix created above, we can use the
&lt;code&gt;TrainLDAModel&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;semantic_analysis.R&lt;/code&gt; to train a LDA model.
(Note: I don&amp;rsquo;t understand all of steps in the code in &lt;code&gt;TrainLDAModel&lt;/code&gt;
refactored from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/benmarwick/AAA2011-Tweets&#34;&gt;Ben Marwick&amp;rsquo;s
repo&lt;/a&gt;. So please help to
check it if you understand LDA.) This step may take a while depending on
the size of the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# timing start
ptm &amp;lt;- proc.time()

# generate a LDA model
lda &amp;lt;- TrainLDAModel(td.mat)

# time used
proc.time() - ptm

##    user  system elapsed
##  143.25    0.02  143.78
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThiS LDA model contains 25 topics. We can check keywords in each topic,
get relevant topics of each tweet, and compute similarity scores among
tweets based on topics they are related to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# get keywords for each topic

      <title>&#34;Overview&#34; of #AERA2012 Tweets</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aera.net/&#34;&gt;AERA Annual Meeting&lt;/a&gt; is probably the largest getting-together of educational researchers and practitioners around the world. This year it has around 13,000 participants. Several hundreds of them are taking advantage of Twitter as a &#34;backchannel&#34; for communication at this conference. On Twitter, hashtags are usually used to easily aggregate tweets of a same topic together. This year, three hashtags, i.e. #AERA2012, #AERA, and #AERA12, are used, and #AERA2012 is the most popular one. For me as a person who cannot make it to the annual meeting this year, following tweets gathered around these hashtags provides me an opportunity to &#34;participate&#34; virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to follow such an amount of tweets produced by hundreds of people seems to be a challenge. To make sure I have a chance to go back and review those tweets, I created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aup6zwZoYbZ1dEhHazBYOEZrd0N2UmtQdm9BajdyUnc#gid=82&#34;&gt;public archive&lt;/a&gt; of tweets containing the #AERA2012 hashtag by using &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/01/twitter-archive-tagsv3/&#34;&gt;Twitter Archive Google Spreadsheet – TAGS v3.0&lt;/a&gt;&#34; developed by Martin Hawksey. During the first few days of this conference, participants have produced more than 4,000 tweets, around 2500 of them are unique. Even if you&#39;re ambitious enough to read all of them, it&#39;s always nice if you can put the whole bunch of tweets in a magic box and let it tell what the main things people are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Overview program is designed to do this trick. &lt;a href=&#34;http://overview.ap.org/&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source tool to help journalists find stories in large amounts of data, by cleaning, visualizing and interactively exploring large document and data sets. Although it was designed for journalists, it has potential uses in many other contexts. I exported the Twitter archive as a CSV file and put it into the Overview program. It did some preprocessing tasks as the first step, and then I can really start to explore this dataset. (For details about how to do this, read this &lt;a href=&#34;http://overview.ap.org/blog/2012/02/getting-started-with-the-overview-prototype/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I got at the first place. The left side panel presents a topic tree that helps me navigate the whole dataset by topics this programs identified (through some natural language processing techniques). The right side panel is a visualization of tweets, with each dot representing an individual tweet. One design principle of the Overview project is to combine the power of both machine and human to make sense of data, so as a user I am encouraged to go through this dataset, and assign tags to each topic; that&#39;s what the central panel do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/11.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-206&#34; title=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/11.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;186&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went through the dataset by clicking on those topics (and sub-topics) in the topic tree one by one, and assign a tag to tweets that are about a same topic. This process was like coding when analyzing qualitative data. And what I did was just the first round of coding. After spending two hours doing this, here is what I got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/21.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-207&#34; title=&#34;2&#34; src=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/21.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;185&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the topic tree and the visualization become colorful, because a list of tags with colors were created for clusters of tweets. The first round of tagging/coding identified 45 tags. They are rough and need further refinement. But by looking at the top 20 tags you can get a sense what colleagues were mainly talking about on Twitter during the conference. Results indicate that many people were using Twitter to share session information, invite people to their exhibitions, welcome people in various ways, share personal status (like I&#39;m at a session about bla and it rocks), organize tweetup, etc. A number of tweets were about the case that US scholars were denied entry to Canada for the AERA meeting. Some tweets were about complains and discussions on wifi issues and confusion of multiple hashtags. Only a few among these top 20 tags were about content of presentations, such as race issues in education, bullying and cyber-bullying, higher education, and indigenous education. (Note: the tag &#34;no-content&#34; covers those tweets that have a list of question marks, maybe because they&#39;re in a different language (I did notice colleagues from Japan were also tweeting). Apparently Overview needs to make improvement on internationalization.) Overall, this preliminary analysis of this dataset may sound discouraging to me who was eager to participate virtually by following the Twitter stream of this conference, simply because only a little portion of those tweets were about real content of presentations and few of them were related to my interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-209&#34; title=&#34;4&#34; src=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;481&#34; height=&#34;289&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Overview program can further cluster the visualization by running a force-directed layout (see below). Now you can see where those different clusters/topics are distributing and navigate manually to make sense of the dataset. You may realize there are a number of dark dots in the background. My sense is they are tweets this program is having a hard time assigning to any topic. You can zoom in to read what they&#39;re really about and get a better understanding of the dataset, if you have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/31.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-208&#34; title=&#34;3&#34; src=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/31.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;185&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, this blog post presents a simple experiment using the Overview program to help me understand the &#34;large&#34; corpus of tweets produced by AERA Annual Meeting participants so far. Although the Overview program is still prototypic and needs further improvements, it did provide an interesting and fruitful way to achieve my goal. Meanwhile, this little experiment may also provide some insight for understanding usage of Twitter as a backchannel for communication at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;从微博上读到白杨同学的博文“学术盛宴”与自我反思，很有意思。我本科时也顶礼膜拜地聆听过大牛们的教诲，只是我没有她那么幸运，至今还没有遇见我一直敬重的南国农先生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章给我一个很强烈的感受——南先生的讲话在这个会议里似乎有些格格不入。他的惭愧和谦虚映衬着其他的欣欣向荣，他困惑和苦口婆心的对面是其他的牛B哄哄和创造力无限。在这里我也困惑了——困惑的是为什么只有南先生提出困惑。因为我读到的是第二手信息，或许只是因为信息失真了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但愿真的是信息失真了！在过去的几年时间里，我已经很多次地听到一个急切而自信满满的声音，“中国教育学者不能只跟在西方学者后面亦步亦趋……老外那一套没什么了不起……我们应该在学习理论上自主创新……”作为一个初出茅庐的后生，在听到这种声音时还是很激动的。但再仔细看一看创新出来的东西，又有些失落。回头再看看那句话，分不清那到底是自信还是自卑？位轻言微，我的失落算不得什么，我甚至为在盛宴之际感到失落还有一种罪孽深重之感。可既然说了，就不妨冒天下之大不韪地说下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;研究教育技术要扎根教育问题，回归课堂、关注具体学科。本科时听到不少教育技术学人和教育、心理学学者掐架的段子，听得义愤填膺、同仇敌忾。后来发现，人家生气也是由原因的。你教育技术一上来，首先认为自己是一个孤儿，到处找自己的理论基础。逮到了教育学、心理学，却冷不防把人家数落一番，把皮亚杰、布鲁姆的理论给否定了。后来枝叶“繁茂”了，还有人说要升辈份，弄个一级学科，和教育学平起平坐。有那么一些不可思议。后来我想，这种对立有必要吗？或许经历这些年的发展，我们已经改观了许多。但读到学界的一些“理论创新”时，又发现它们没在展现出多少对教育的理解。缺乏对教育问题的思考、脱离课堂和学科教育，让我们丢失了一大片领地和与其他领域合作的机会；欠缺教育研究方法的修为，让一些研究缺乏应有的效力。翻看我们的杂志，有多少研究走出了我们的传统视界？在那些走出去了的研究中，有多少采用了严格合理的研究方法？困住手脚坐在井里，如何不引发如南先生那样的忧虑？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;与教育技术研究相联系的是一些教育技术项目的匆忙上马。一个教育技术产品在一个地区内的广泛推行，经过了多少论证？有多少研究结果发现这个产品对学生的学习是有帮助的？这里边的水不去量也罢，但为什么我们听不到多少别的声音？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;理论创新是一件好事，尤其对中国教育技术界。但唐突和没有研究支撑的理论创新是苍白和短命的。达尔文的自然选择是在经历了几十年的观察和思考后得来的。我们不是不可以挑战西方理论，可我们更不可以在没有深入了解现有理论的基础上去提自己的理论，不然说出去只会闹笑话。从科学史看，一个新理论要站得住需要几个重要的标准：准确、稳定、宽阔的适用范围、简单、富有成效[1]。其中需要强调的是，理论创新不都是踩在别人身上往上爬，其中很重要的一点是建立新理论与现有理论之间的稳定性。在教育领域尤其如此，如果教育技术理论把教育、心理以及社会学里一些成熟的理论都给否定了，那么这样的理论多半也只会是个笑话。此外，理论应该是富有成效的，能解释现有理论解释不了的东西，能为某一问题的研究打开不一样的视角。这样理论才能有后续的研究力量注入，进一步论证、发展和完善这些理论。这些基本条件，我们提的新理论满足了吗？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;教育技术的发展是大家都希望看到的，但有些问题从我9年前进入这个领域时就有却现在还在困扰着我们。是积重难返，还是可以亡羊补牢？南先生在反思，我们能一起反思吗？&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;两月前从南方周末上读到有关《中县干部》的报道时首先是眼前一亮，并为其作者北大社会学系博士生冯军旗能写出这么有社会价值的论文而深表羡慕。可读完报道时我心底不禁出现一丝疑虑——这样的社会学研究有悖于“学术伦理道德”吗？此时心底另一个声音响起——在一个很多地方（尤其是这篇论文中的研究对象）都缺乏道德的社会，是否真的能去要求研究者遵从学术伦理道德？在一番激烈交锋之后，第一个声音在我这里获胜了。不管别人有没有道德，“斯文人”应该带头讲一讲伦理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;或许我就是“消夏湾人”在他/她的为《中县干部》辩护中嗤之以鼻的“喜欢高举学术中立大旗、挟洋自重、迂腐不化”之人。消某的文章直指之人即是对《中县干部》在学术伦理环节提出质疑的旅美学者程海华。程海华认为，“学者是研究人员，而不是新闻记者或执法者，并不肩负揭黑打黑的责任。‘卧底式’研究是违反学术道德而绝对禁止的。社会科学伦理审查制度不仅保护了被采访研究对象，也防止研究者超越身份的研究遭受被采访者的报复。”但在消某看来，美国的学术伦理审查对于社会学研究是摆设，因为社会学、政治学和人类学这类研究对研究对象造不成像医学研究那样的直接伤害，而审查的目的更重要的是保证研究的公信力，在众多耗资巨费的大样本研究中剔除那些没价值的研究。消某的信口开河其实不值得一驳。翻看任何一所研究型大学的学术伦理审查委员会网站（如多伦多大学REB）都可以看到，维持研究的正当性和保护研究对象的正当权利是学术伦理审查的基本目的，而这远非论文成文时的匿名处理所能保障的。通常情况下，研究者需要收集研究对象的书面同意书，否则从研究对象那里获得的数据是不应该被分析和写入论文的。《中县干部》显然触犯了这一基本准则。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;站在消那边的还有媒体评论人“鱼竹舟”。他的基本论点是美国那一套不适合我们的国情。他的观点在环球网的投票中也得到了更多的支持，这一民意在程海华文章及朱迅垚分别的一篇文章的评论留言里也能体现。大众对学术伦理存在价值的不认可，是让我最担心的地方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《中县干部》这个案例中冯军旗似乎是为侠士。侠士精神在中国似乎一直以来很受爱戴，这多少干扰了我们在这个案例里对学术伦理的判断。换一个目前被推上风口浪尖的校车问题。针对资金困难的问题，北师大某位教授另辟溪径，提议我们让学生们乘坐校车时刷卡，同时记录下学生的身高、体重等数据，转手把这些数据卖给有需要的机构，从而弥补一部分校车运营成本。试问全国中小学学生的此类隐私数据，谁可以随意去收集和专卖？这种提议从研究者口里提出来，可以反映出学术伦理在我们很多研究者心里几乎可有可无。研究者尚且如此，况大众乎？《中县干部》的研究在很多人眼里是在“除暴安良”，但社会民愤不应掩盖其不符合伦理的研究行为。假如研究的对象是如农村留守儿童、残疾人等容易受到伤害的人时，大家还会觉得伦理道德不重要吗？对研究对象的伤害可能在无意间造成，仅仅依靠研究者的自律是不够的。如果没有一个经验丰富、可靠的机构去审查研究提案，在研究之前如果没有充分考虑研究可能给研究对象带来的伤害，被研究者就容易受到伤害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;研究（research）这个词蕴含着研究者和被研究者之间不平等的权力关系。当欧洲殖民者对北美土著进行研究，并把研究结果用来指导新的殖民政策制定时，研究是一个十分肮脏的词汇。如今，纵使研究这个词早已变得神圣了许多，研究和被研究的关系仍然使得被研究者处在弱势的地位。通过伦理审查保证研究的正当性是对被研究者的保护，其实也是对研究者的保护。在此呼吁包括政策制定者、大学和科研单位等相关部门重视起来，虽然我知道你们一直都忙得很。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Promisingness Judgments by Grade 3s</title>
      <link>/blog/2011-09-16-promisingness-judgments-by-grade-3s/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2011-09-16-promisingness-judgments-by-grade-3s/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I started working on a tool called &#34;&lt;em&gt;Promising Ideas tool&lt;/em&gt;,&#34; firstly named as &#34;&lt;em&gt;Big Ideas tool&lt;/em&gt;,&#34; one and a half years ago. It is an add-on to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.knowledgeforum.com/&#34;&gt;Knowledge Forum&lt;/a&gt; (KF), a knowledge-building environment used in many kinds of settings but mostly in primary schools. The Promising Ideas tool is really simple in terms of functionality. It looks like a lite and KF-confined version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diigo.com/about&#34;&gt;Diigo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://asc-parc.blogspot.com/2008/06/spartagus-and-click2tag-lowering.html&#34;&gt;SparTag.us&lt;/a&gt;, which are both used for people to tag important information on the Web and leave traces for later-comers for better browsing heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;em&gt;Promising Ideas tool&lt;/em&gt; was designed on a distinctive philosophy and to meet very different needs. A phenomenon I learned from both talking with teachers and reading student notes in KF is that, young students may repeat each other&#39;s ideas for weeks and weeks without moving their shared understanding forward. The reasons for this phenomenon are complicated. One possible reason might be that young students cannot intentionally process that much information produced by their peers at a time; as a result, although the community knowledge might grow fast at the beginning of their inquiry, it may enter a plateau phase when students are slowing picking up each other&#39;s ideas and promising ideas become swamped in a number of repeating ones. It seems beneficial for a class to stop contributing new notes at some point and start reflecting on existing ideas in their community. At this point, two questions came to our minds: (1) Do/Can young students have a sense about the status or frontier of their community knowledge? (2) How can we make promising ideas in their discourse more visible and help them make more progress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we designed and developed the Promising Ideas tool, to help students make &lt;em&gt;promisingness judgments&lt;/em&gt; on their peer discourse. As soon as we produced the first prototype in 2010, we started to test the tool in a primary school. &lt;a href=&#34;http://individual.utoronto.ca/bodongchen/file/Chen_et_al_CSCL2011_Promising_final.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A paper[in pdf]&lt;/a&gt; about how well can Grade 5/6 students do promisingness judgments without any intervention was presented at CSCL 2011 conference in Hong Kong. From April to June this year, we conducted the most recent pilot in a Grade 3 class. Before we started this pilot, teachers were very concerned whether Grade 3s can grasp the meaning of &#34;promising;&#34; they were also worried whether promisingness judgments would lead to a fear of sharing ideas among students, as I described in &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/promise-from-an-idea-and-promisingness/&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;. Those concerns are all valid and valuable and we agreed we should pay special attention to the words we use in communicating the tool and the philosophy and intention behind this tool to kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first session of this intervention was a 30 mins Knowledge Building (KB) talk about the meaning of &#34;promising ideas,&#34; led by a teacher who had years of experience in KB. This talk was fruitful. The class arrived at a shared understanding that promising ideas were ideas that &#34;they wish to spend time on,&#34; &#34;are not necessarily correct at the beginning and may end up change a little bit in further inquiry,&#34; and would &#34;deepen their shared understanding.&#34; This promisingness talk is crucial for successful use of this tool, in the sense that it helps students understand the reason and purpose of using this tool. The first part of the following video, 0:01 to 4:40, is a concise version of the promisingness talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[vimeo http://www.vimeo.com/28511997]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second session of this pilot was a tool tutorial session led by my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;http://reganmian.net/monica/&#34;&gt;Monica Resendes&lt;/a&gt;. She walked through all important features of this tool in front of all students. Questions popped up from time to time among students and were quickly responded. This session lasted for around 15 mins. Students learned this tool pretty fast and moved to do actual promisingness judgments with this tool. (To get a better sense about how this tool works, watch the following video.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[vimeo http://www.vimeo.com/28512202]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third session, students worked in pairs and spent 20 mins on conducting promisingness judgments on their notes in a KF view they were working on. They identified 88 &#34;promising&#34; ideas (28 distinctive ones after collapsing overlapping ideas). All those ideas were piped into an idea space attached to the specific view they were working on. After idea tagging was done, we displayed the idea space to all students sitting in a circle (see the second part of the first video). The teacher and students went through the ideas and discussed on each idea at the top of the list. Finally, they collectively selected three &#34;most promising&#34; ideas and exported them to a new view for further inquiry in the following weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran this intervention for two iterations in the same class when they were studying the same curriculum unit. Eventually, students produced three KF views that represent three different stages of their collective inquiry. Preliminary analysis shows the quality of their notes (measured with a &#34;scientificness&#34; scheme) and students&#39; conceptual understanding of that unit (measured by Latent Semantic Analysis between student notes and authoritative sources) has significantly improved across three views. I also analyzed data from a control group and did not find such significant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the Promising Ideas tool is simple and can be used very differently. However, I think the most powerful way of using this tool is to facilitate promisingness judgments by students in their knowledge-building discourse. This use case or intention clearly distinguish the tool from some social bookmarking or highlighting tools, like Diigo and SparTag.us. While the meaning of &#34;promisingness&#34; and fundamental psychological mechanisms of doing promisingness judgments are still open to debate, it is important to engage students in a discussion about the meaning and importance of &#34;promising ideas&#34; before actually using this tool. Substantial work needs to be done in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The meaning of promisingness</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Although I have been using the word “promisingness” in my writing and conversations since last year, I am still not 100% percent sure about the meaning of it. When we discuss this concept with primary school teachers, they also found it not easy to grasp, let alone young kids (however, we are teaching this concept to grade 3s). This situation is not surprising because promisingness is not even recognized as a word in many popular dictionaries. But for me, it’s time to make it clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first straightforward thing to do is to understand the words promising and promise, which are more human words for us. The English word promise was introduced from Latin words prōmissa, prōmissum and prōmittere around 1400AD. For prōmittere: pro- &amp;ldquo;before&amp;rdquo; + mittere &amp;ldquo;to put, send.&amp;rdquo; So the ground sense of “a promise” is “declaration made about the future, about some act to be done or not done.” The verb meaning of promise was attested from 1420.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of promising appeared much later, only from 1601. Although several online dictionaries including Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com provide different definitions for this word, two components of meaning are shared by them: (1) for future, and (2) something good or success. For example, promising means “showing signs of future success or excellence,” “likely to turn out well,” or “likely to succeed or yield good results.” &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visuwords.com/&#34;&gt;VisuWords&lt;/a&gt; (which is based on WordNet) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visualthesaurus.com/&#34;&gt;VisualThesaurus&lt;/a&gt; both identify hopeful and bright as words with similar meaning of promising, and likely as a word close to promising. The connection with words hopeful and bright is consistent with the meaning of “something good in the future,” while the link with likely suggest another important meaning of promising: possibility of success. In my opinion, this component seems to be more implicit comparing with the first two, i.e. for future and something good or success, which are usually well perceived when mentioning the word promising. Since people care more about the good quality of an idea when describing it as promising, how possible will it turn out to be successful is not usually the first thing to considering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/promising-visuwords.png/&#34; alt=&#34;promising&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thesaurus of Merriam-Webster is doing a good job partially uncovering the usually neglected meaning to me. It explains promising in two different ways: (1) having qualities that inspire hope, and (2) pointing toward a happy outcome. While the second explanation is consistent with our commonly held understanding of this word, the first explanation focuses on qualities that show promise and implies that the possibility of success is open to discuss by evaluating those qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till now, my understanding about promisingness becomes a little bit clearer. It also gets closer to the concept of promisingness coined by Carl Bereiter, whose work serves as the basis of my thinking on this concept. Based on his decades of research on expertise, Bereiter thinks a key competency of creative experts is to identify promising directions. For example, studies show that chess masters don’t consider significantly more steps than experienced players, but they focus their thoughts on promising ones. So, as Bereiter argues, the ability to make promisingness judgements is vital for creative work, where people need to deal with ill-defined or wicked problems and multiple “risky” directions. He thinks promisingness judgements are made based on some impressionistic knowledge of people, i.e. impressions that can be used to guide decisions, which can only be acquired from experience. As a result, there seems to be no criteria for people to evaluate promisingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, attributing promisingness judgements all to impressions seems to be not enough or not helpful for the holy enterprise of “educating” people to recognize promising ideas or directions. To help students achieve a good understanding of promisingness and conduct promisingness judgements calls for a deeper understanding on the process of promisingness judgements by experts. Are there any implicit qualities of ideas that impress us and make us regard those ideas as promising? If so, what are they? Answering these mysterious questions will enable us to develop criteria for promisingness evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrating Knowledge Building with Open Educational Resources</title>
      <link>/blog/2010-12-24-integrate-knowledge-building-with-learning-in-open-educational-resources/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-educational-resources&#34;&gt;Open Educational Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) which was launched in 2002, the open educational resources (OER) movement, which strives to “champion the sharing of knowledge worldwide to increase human intellectual capacity,” has rapidly expanded throughout the world and is becoming increasingly powerful in the era of knowledge creation and lifelong learning. Most OER projects to date have been concentrated on making quality educational content openly and freely accessible on the Internet. The MIT OCW, which has opened course materials, such as syllabus, course calendar, lecture notes, assignments, exams, labs and projects, hyper-books, simulations, and video lectures, of almost every course taught at MIT, might be a best representative of those projects. A number of other prestigious universities around the globe have also launched their own projects to make various types of course materials open to the public, in their own distinctive ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the emphasis on educational content of many projects, a misconception that OER means open educational content or open courseware widely exists. However, improving teaching and learning merely by making course materials openly accessible seems to be a myth. Taking the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ocw.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;MIT OCW&lt;/a&gt; for example, according to its site statistics of the MIT OCW in 2005 (MIT OpenCourseWare, 2006), 51% of all visits to the site are single page-views, 70% of visitors to the site visit only once, and the average duration of a visit to the site is 11 minutes (without counting all those single-page views). These data that reflect a low use of static course content in the MIT OCW imply a gap of learning support in many OER projects. Furthermore, even if it achieves critical improvements on those analytics, how much a learner learn by reading course materials is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As agreed on by several definitions of OER, content is only one aspect of OER. According to the definition Marshall Smith gives in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5910/89.abstract&#34;&gt;his paper&lt;/a&gt; published on &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, open educational resources are content (courses, books, lesson plans, articles, etc.), tools (virtual laboratories, simulations, and games), and software that support learning and educational practice. Candace Thille also notes in her chapter in the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;amp;tid=11309&#34;&gt;Opening Up Education&lt;/a&gt;, although these OER projects have enabled a great step forward in democratizing access to educational materials, the next step of the OER movement is to make &lt;em&gt;instruction&lt;/em&gt;, not merely materials, accessible to learners, and improve teaching and learning. According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oerderves.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/a-review-of-the-open-educational-resources-oer-movement_final.pdf&#34;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, &amp;ldquo;open participatory learning&amp;rdquo; will be a promising new culture of learning, given such a vast ocean of open educational content created in the past ten years by OER projects across countries. So one important area that is critical for the ultimate sustainability and impact of OER on teaching and learning is about the extent of use of OER. Thus, we should not put our emphasis solely on high-quality open content, but move forward to understand and stimulate use of those open educational materials for the sake of learning. For the next step, it seems urgent to initiate an awful amount of research on how to effectively use open educational materials to really promote teaching and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-learning-initiative&#34;&gt;Open Learning Initiative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carnegie Mellon &lt;a href=&#34;http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/&#34;&gt;Open Learning Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (OLI) distinguishes itself from many other content-oriented projects by developing computer-assisted feedback loops for deep learning in its learning environments. With a goal to develop a web-based learning environment that enactments powerful instruction, the OLI compiled a team of content experts, learning scientists, and software engineers. The team’s efforts span from developing better resources, designing cycles of feedback, to conducting studies to deepen our understanding of learning. Among these efforts, developing cycles of feedback is regarded as the pivotal aspect, or the &amp;ldquo;killer app,&amp;rdquo; of achieving enactment of instruction in OLI learning environments. The Digital Dashboard for Learning (DDL) is developed for this purpose; it collects learning data as students work through online instructional activities, summarizes this data, and displays meaningful indicators of learning progress to teachers or students. Several evaluation &lt;a href=&#34;http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/initiative/publications&#34;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; reported equivalent learning gains, “accelerated learning,” and better learning retention of standalone learning in OLI than in traditional classroom learning environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although OLI has its advantage on formative feedback loops and strong background in intelligent tutoring system comparing with many other projects, a large portion of learning in OLI is expected to happen in the interactions between a learner and well-designed course materials with multimedia, interactive simulation, and feedback tools. In this sense, OLI adopts a didactic pedagogy and does not support peer collaboration in its web-based learning environments. Although individuals now have access to educational opportunities formerly available only to students in top-flight universities, unless they are enrolled in some organized program, they do not have the benefit of social supports, knowledge sharing, and collaborative building of understanding that can be gained in a quality campus milieu. Apparently, the current pedagogical models in OLI as well as many other projects lack affordances that directly address the socio-cognitive dimensions of learning. As argued in the OLCOS Roadmap 2012, since the knowledge society is built to a large degree on digital environments of work and social communication, such (open educational) practices must foster a creative and collaborative engagement of learners with digital content, tools, and services in the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, the use of social software tools and services such as Weblogs, Wikis, social networking, and social bookmarking services beyond the educational sector has played an active and important role in OER. As the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.olcos.org/english/roadmap/download/index.htm&#34;&gt;OLCOS Roadmap 2012&lt;/a&gt; notes, the success of social software with many users has inspired the idea of a Personal Learning Environment (PLE), which integrates several tools and services a learner can benefit from in self-directed and collaborative online learning. In 2006, MIT OCW tried to launch a customized version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://elgg.org/&#34;&gt;Elgg&lt;/a&gt;, an open source social network tool, to allow learners to develop their own portfolios and to gain peer group support through the networking functionality. For now MIT OCW is using a social learning network, &lt;a href=&#34;http://openstudy.com/&#34;&gt;OpenStudy&lt;/a&gt;, to organize study groups around courses. However, because of an overwhelmingly large portion of peripheral participation in most study groups, level of collaboration in OpenStudy, which mainly happens in the forms of asking and answering questions, is pretty low. The &lt;a href=&#34;p2pu.org&#34;&gt;Peer 2 Peer University&lt;/a&gt; (P2PU) project has created another model of organizing learning around open educational materials. It runs courses in a six-week semester format. Course instructors or facilitators are all volunteers. Tools for communication and collaboration in a course are usually picked from a variety of tools suggested in the P2PU community course toolbox. Apparently, P2PU goes much further than a peer-tutoring system or a social learning network, in facilitating deeper and more sustaining collaboration, promoting deeper learning, and pursuing ways of accreditation for learning achievement in the OER context. However, the current model of P2PU greatly relies on a lot of volunteering organization and facilitation, and learning is framed in a term-based course running manner. So there is a call for an inclusive learning environment that can weave learning happening on extensive content together for an individual, can support communities of learners, can encourage closer and more sustainable peer-to-peer communication and collaboration, and can enhance socio-cognitive gains in learning with OER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;knowledge-building&#34;&gt;Knowledge Building&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing the infrastructure to support peer-to-peer collaboration and discourse is where Knowledge Building theory and technology can play a significant role in the world of OER. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ikit.org/fulltext/2003_knowledge_building.pdf&#34;&gt;Knowledge Building&lt;/a&gt;, coined in 1980s by Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter, is defined as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the production and continual improvement of &lt;em&gt;ideas &lt;/em&gt;of value to a community, through means that increase the likelihood that what the community accomplishes will be greater than the sum of individual contributions and part of broader cultural efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Building is distinct from learning in that it results in the creation or modification of public knowledge, while learning is an internal, unobservable process that results in changes of belief, attitude, or skill of an individual; personal learning is regarded as a by-product of knowledge building in this theory. Foundational to Knowledge Building theory, as applied to educational contexts, is the notion that &lt;em&gt;ideas &lt;/em&gt;ought to be at the center of educational endeavours. These ideas are continually improved through a social process, with a shared goal to advance the frontiers of knowledge as members of the community perceive them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These educational perspectives has informed the design of &lt;a href=&#34;http://builder.ikit.org/login&#34;&gt;Knowledge Forum&lt;/a&gt;, software that supports Knowledge Building pedagogy and the process of knowledge creation. Current features in Knowledge Forum have produced strong educational results and have allowed us to identify levels of competence that young students are capable of but are obscured by traditional learning environments and not revealed by current assessments. Knowledge Forum emphasizes embedded and transformative assessment as an integral component of discourse. By collecting and analyzing data from students’ knowledge building activities, such as reading, building-on, referencing and creating views, a rich collection of analytic tools discloses to students extensive information about their progress, e.g., individual and group contribution, vocabulary growth, social network, and semantic overlap between each other’s contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge building theory and technology support a distinctive pedagogy that is based on 12 Knowledge Building principles (introduced in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ikit.org/fulltext/2002CollectiveCog.pdf&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;), rather than traditionally based on procedures. Different from didactic instruction, project-based learning, problem-based learning, inquiry-based learning, and many other pedagogical perspectives, knowledge building pedagogy puts discourse for idea advancement at the center, rather than tasks. As Scardamalia and Bereiter note,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades educators have promoted constructivist ideas among themselves whereas their students have been expected to carry out constructivist activities without access to the constructivist ideas lying behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While traditional procedure-based pedagogy gives teachers a feeling of security, since they can have definite control over classroom activities, knowledge building discourse embraces a kind of &lt;em&gt;uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;, which might not be welcomed by some teachers, but may lead to some phenomenal gains. Such gains are revealed in a number of cases, including the case of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thestar.com/atkinsonseries/atkinson2009/article/719317&#34;&gt;a kindergarten kite-making project&lt;/a&gt; in the Institute of Child Study and a newly reported case about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/europe/elementary-school-childrens-report-on-bees-published-in-prestigious-journal/article1847786/&#34;&gt;a bees scientific research done by 8-10 years old&lt;/a&gt; in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bring-knowledge-building-into-oer&#34;&gt;Bring Knowledge Building into OER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;integrate-knowledge-building-with-oli&#34;&gt;Integrate Knowledge Building with OLI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OER provides a context in which sustained knowledge-building discourse would be highly desirable. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ikit.org/&#34;&gt;Institute for Knowledge Innovation and Technology&lt;/a&gt; (IKIT), where knowledge building research is headquartered, is undertaking with collaborators at Carnegie Mellon University experiments in merging a knowledge-building environment into OLI. The goal of this collaborative project is to bring expertise from two teams together to provide technology that encourages and encourage collaboration at a distance in achieving deeper understanding. This effort aims to go further than the state-of-the-art in OER to enhance both individual learning and group cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This specific integration involves both technological and pedagogical considerations. The two aspects are highly dependent on each other. On the one hand, pedagogical decisions would shed light on technological integrations. For instance, the current OLI, as well as many other OER projects, adopts a traditional knowledge-transmission pedagogy; learners are expected to interact with pre-designed high-quality course material to absorb authoritative knowledge from it. This pedagogical inclination of OLI is now embodied in its current learning environment which puts linearly organized course content at the center. However, the knowledge building pedagogy thinks that knowledge-building discourse should be at the center, discourse would start from authentic problems and focus on real ideas of learners, and authoritative sources are critically used to understand the present state and growing edge of knowledge in the field for the consistent goal of advancing knowledge. Therefore, implementing knowledge-building pedagogy in OLI calls for a radical change on the technological design of the OLI web-based learning environment. On the other hand, technological affordances and constrains would enable or restrain the implementation of pedagogy. The most widely utilized version of Knowledge Forum is a client-based knowledge building environment developed with Java. The main problem of directly using it in the OER context is that Knowledge Forum is a restrictive environment that lacks the highly acclaimed Web 2.0 capacity of communicating with outer spaces by open APIs. This restriction makes the pedagogical intension of making extensive connections between resources, ideas, and people in the OER context almost impossible. Overall, the interplay between pedagogical and technological aspects will be a central issue in integrating Knowledge Building into OER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the initial attempt of integrating Knowledge Building into OLI, the engineer team has implemented a new web-based open source version of Knowledge Forum that can be integrated in any web page. The first integration takes a straightforward approach by directly embedding Knowledge Forum as a discourse component at the bottom of each OLI learning module. Although the new webby Knowledge Forum and its integration with OLI could be regarded as an important move from a confined space to a much more open infrastructure, this integration still looks “superficial” and is far from filling the gap of supporting socio-cognitive dimensions of learning in the OER context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/hypothesis-testing1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-70&#34; title=&#34;OLI-KF&#34; src=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/hypothesis-testing1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;653&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case study with this new integration will be conducted in the spring of 2011 with a college level statistics course. This pilot will pursue utility and usability evaluation of current design based on qualitative feedbacks from teachers and students, and will look for ways to improve the design in the next iteration of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;inclusive-environments-to-support-knowledge-building-across-oer-projects&#34;&gt;Inclusive environments to support Knowledge Building across OER projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, the absence of supports for socio-cognitive dimensions of learning is a main gap for OER. How can we support individual lifelong learners not solely working in MIT OCW, or OLI, but working across different “open educational content repositories”, or even regular web pages? How could we support their learning by building the socio-cultural layer to make connection with peers, and also to make connections between their ideas? How to draw and manage the boundaries of open learner communities? Although there might be many ways to tackle these challenges, this paper tends to focus on knowledge media design as a direction to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable Knowledge Building across a variety of open educational materials, we need to develop an inclusive environment that can operate with any open educational materials. The ideal is that any media object should be treatable as an object of inquiry and knowledge building. To a very limited extent this is done by attaching a discussion board to such diverse objects as blog posts, news articles, and online videos. At worst these become platforms for venting opinions; at best they are platforms for sharing knowledge and giving advice. Rarely if at all are they platforms for sustained knowledge-building discourse. It is not that such discourse is impossible, only that the technology provides no support for it. Most online communication tools adopt a conversation-oriented interaction with participants’ ideas distributed across messages and responses addressing individual and oftentimes the most recent entries. It then becomes difficult for them to see the whole picture of the extended discourse and understand and review group-level progress in the community’s knowledge. As a result, their discourse contributions are often disconnected and redundant, covering the same ground without significant progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the need of an inclusive knowledge-building environment is obvious, there are several vital challenges we are confronted. One big issue will be about object granularity and format diversity. On what grain level of object should the environment operate? How to achieve interoperability given such diverse content formats and levels of object granularity? The second challenge is about how to nurture communities of learners. How to increase social cohesion in OER learner communities? How to encourage different levels of participation and make them all contributing to knowledge-building discourse? The third challenge is how to make knowledge-building discourse pervasive in learner’s journey in OER. These three main issues have to be tackled in the design of the envisioned inclusive knowledge-building environment for OER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several existing tools might shed light on the design of this environment. Cohere is a tool developed in the UK Open University&amp;rsquo;s Knowledge Media Institute, funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, as part of the Open Learning Network (OLnet) project to make high quality learning resources and sensemaking tools freely accessible via the Web (Buckingham Shum, 2008). Idea is the fundamental element in Cohere. An idea is usually linked to one or multiple web resources and emerges during the process of web browsing. What Cohere does is to help users create their ideas, to connect and share ideas, and subsequently connect people who share similar interest. Buckingham Shum (2008) also regards Cohere as a Web 2.0 argumentation tool in that it has several affordances that enable flexible linking ideas and visualizing ideas networks. According to its developers, design of this tool was greatly inspired by Knowledge Building theory and the notion that idea should be put at the center and improved continuously. However, the concept of idea in Cohere is different from that in Knowledge Building theory. The focus of Cohere is to extract “ideas” from open educational materials, make argumentation connections between them, and visualize the connections. The linking effort emphasizes argument relationships between ideas, e.g. “responds to”, “is an example of”, and “positive or negative polarity”, rather than further improving these ideas. Its visualization is implemented in the fashion of concept map, which is good at presenting finalized understanding of knowledge rather than supporting continuous improvement of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diigo and Google SideWiki are two interesting tools that can achieve interaction with fine-grained web content. Both of them work as browser plugins, similar as Cohere, and can mark up any web page. Diigo enables highlight and annotation on any text information and images, and it can bring discourse anywhere on the web. SideWiki takes a whole web page as the basic object and expects users to contribute and read helpful information alongside any web page, but it also supports comments targeted at selected text on the page. Their design of user’s interaction with web pages reveals rich possibilities in designing inclusive knowledge building environments for learning in OER. They make discourse pervasive in the web sphere, and help users accumulate materials and personal understanding in their personal libraries in the cloud. However, both tools fall short of the important ability to organize ideas in a flexible way and to encourage continuous improvement of ideas. Google SideWiki aggregates all entries written by a user on this user’s Google profile. Diigo stores web page URLs and mark-ups generated by users into personal or group libraries. All entries are organized basically in a linear manner, and users can use tags and lists to organize information for later retrieval. To support sustaining knowledge building discourse, the envisioned system should have the capacity to keep ideas more actively “living” in the space and to enable learners to easily retrieve and collectively improve their ideas. Such capacity may be achieved through some visualization based on knowledge cartography and semantic techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scirus.com/srsapp/sciruslink?src=utrdsp&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftspace.library.utoronto.ca%2Fbitstream%2F1807%2F24893%2F1%2FTeplovs_Christopher_201006_PhD_thesis.pdf&#34;&gt;Knowledge Space Visualizer&lt;/a&gt; (KSV) developed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://chris.ikit.org/&#34;&gt;Christopher Teplovs&lt;/a&gt; is a prototypic system for showing reconstructed representations of discourse-based artifacts and facilitating assessment in light of patterns of interactivity of participants and their ideas. It integrates techniques from Latent Semantic Analysis and Social Network Analysis to infer relationships among ideas generated in online discourse, to visualize idea network in a community, detect knowledge advancements, and provide formative feedback to students and teachers. A tool like KSV would be very useful in the context of OER in hosting and visualizing rich data in the learning process and making sustaining idea advancement possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, issues like object granularity and format diversity pose even bigger challenges to the integration of Knowledge Building in the whole OER context than in the OLI environment. Sustaining knowledge-building discourse across multiple OER projects calls for an inclusive knowledge building environment that can operate with any kind of web object. Figure below depicts a preliminary design, named “OER Backpack”, created by four engineer students under the guidance of IKIT researchers in November 2010. Rather than solving issues discussed above, such design mockups open up a lot of new issues open to be discussed. Because of the limitation of length, this white paper would not further discuss design considerations embedded in this initial design effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/picture1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;Picture1&#34; src=&#34;http://bodongchen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/picture1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;373&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the triad OER logic model proposed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oerderves.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/a-review-of-the-open-educational-resources-oer-movement_final.pdf&#34;&gt;the 2007 report&lt;/a&gt; from Hewitt Foundation highlights, understanding and stimulating usage of OER is one important challenge, besides sponsoring high-quality open content and removing barriers. The lack of learning support and socio-cognitive dimensions of learning are two disturbing gaps in many OER projects. As a theory rooted in socio-cultural constructivism, Knowledge Building theory, which has been applied in extensive contexts ranging from K-12, graduate school, to professional development in healthcare, could contribute in a way to fill these gaps in OER. However, this integration between Knowledge Building and OER calls for highly sophisticated designs of knowledge media to tackle various issues. This essay specifically explores possible designs to integrate the Open Learning Initiative (OLI) project with Knowledge Building/Knowledge Forum. The ultimate goal is to extend from OLI, which is a single OER project, to the broader OER context. By analyzing new challenges proposed by the new context, several key questions that should be answered in the designs are put forward. These questions, together with a review of several existing tools, help to initiate the pursuit of an envisioned inclusive knowledge building environment for the OER context.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;这是一个极其复杂和难辩的题目，不过最近有幸读了一些有关教育改革的文章，索性也胡乱说一说。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“现代课程理论”和“现代教学测量”之父泰勒在接受一个采访时提到，他很庆幸他所在的国家的联邦政府、州政府把大量有关课程的教育决策权“下放”到通常以学区为单位的学校委员会（school board），学校委员会有时还会进一步把修改课程的权力进一步下放到学校。这里用下放这个词在一些人眼里是不正确的，因为课程理论研究了这么多年，对于课程应该源于哪里，教育的目的应该是什么从未有定见。泰勒眼里的教育是通过让个人接受普世价值而让这个社会粘合在一起，因此强调教育的社会功能。而研究权力理论的人会把教育看作是掌权者用来继续维持他们权力的工具。后现代思潮中的学者或许会更强调教育的多重性和文化相关性，认为课程要融入目标群体的文化特性。相比这种分散式的教育/课程决策体系，集中式的、至上而下的教育决策体系也在一些国家存在，如俄罗斯、中国、法国和二战前夕的德国。泰勒在上个世纪六七十年代分别到访过莫斯科和北京，他描述的情形和我经历的教育完全是吻合的。看来在我们经历的自上而下的教育体系中，教育变革的幅度是比较小的，速度是比较慢的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;那么如泰勒描述的那种分权、去中心化模式是否能带来大量的变革呢？另一位学者库班在1988年的一篇文章里给出了否定的答案。他分析美国20世纪的教育改革，发现依然只有少量的成功的教育变革。对于教育改革，他做了一个类比。美国航天局1986年1月28日发射的“挑战者号”航天飞机在发射后73秒后坠毁，7名航天员全部遇难。在之后的调查中，美国航天局主要从“飞船设计失误”和“质量控制”两个方面找原因，试图找到改善现状的方法。库班认为教育改革通常也是如此。与“飞船及发射质量控制”和“飞船基本设计”两个方面相对应，他把教育变革分为两类：“一级变革”和“二级变革”。一级变革指的是在不对现有系统伤筋动骨的基础上，尝试去让现有系统更有效、更具效率。对于飞船事故来说，就是去看是否在某些细小环节上存在瑕疵，并努力去修正它。二级变革则不同，它通常是去寻找整个系统设计的缺陷，是对系统的大幅度的修正。对于飞船来说就是去看是否是因为整体设计上的失误导致了这次事故。对应到教育领域中，库班认为之所以过去一个世纪里的教育在工业时代建立起来的学校体系的基础上没有大的变化，是因为这个世纪里取得成功的教育改革大多多是“一级变革”，而只有很少的“二级变革”取得了成功。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;那么为什么那么多的教育改革失败了呢？他认为一个很重要的原因是大量教育变革都把改变教师行为作为一个重要的目标，而很多改革的主导者却并没有真正去理解一个教师在学校里每天最基本的实践是什么，没有去认真分析改革情境里的一些现状，最后遭到了包括很多教师和学校领导在内的抵抗。几天前读到深圳一位一线教师转发的一篇叫做“教师很疲惫”的文章，描述教师对于一些社会部门“进校园活动”疲于奔命，而不能把更多精力投入到教学思考的现状。文中提到这些社会部门的进校园活动为学校安排了多达18门在国家课程计划规定之外的课程，其中有很多重复和冗余，耗费了师生的大量精力。暂不谈这些“进校园活动”的动机到底是某些部门的面子工程，还是真的是在响应“校本课程”的号召，单就教师的反应来看，这个变革就已经失败了。或许这不是一个关于改变教师行为的例子，但却体现了目前我们在进行的一些如火如荼的变革中，在我们的自上而下的模式里缺少一种对现实情境的具体分析。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一个决定“二级变革”是否成功的关键是改革是否能获得社会、立法和政府部门的支持。从2002年麻省理工大学（MIT）尝试开放该校的课程开始，开放教育资源运动已经席卷全球。中国也有我们自己的全国范围内巨大规模的“精品课程”项目。开放教育资源运动除了有广泛的社会需求（让更多的人获得名牌高校的教育资源）之外，还有大量科研基金会及政府政策导引的支持。因此这是一个目前来看取得很大成功的“二级变革”。同时，几天前我也读到了南方人物周刊上有关国内教育技术界的大师、北师大何克抗教授的“跨越式项目”的报道。根据报道，虽然项目在研究上获得了很多数据去证明它的成功，却因迟迟不能获得高层领导的支持而陷入困境。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;比库班更早的一篇发表于1972年的文章分析了在那之前75年内美国发生的各种教育改革。有别于库班的那篇思辨性文章，这篇文章从分析这些教育改革的多项特性出发去分析影响教育改革成败的因素。这些特性包括改革的年代（1950年前还是后）、起因来自教育系统内部还是外部、变革关注什么领域（教学/课程/组织和管理）、以及对改革成效的打分。文章通过一系列分析得出的结果与库班的论点有很多吻合之处。比如，这篇文章的作者也认为如果一个教育改革要求教师抛弃现有的实践方式而接受一种全新的时间方式，那么这项改革就有更大失败的危险。同时，一项改革给人们带来的认知负担会影响这项改革的成效能否长期维持下去。他们也发现由外部发起的变革比从教育内部发起的变革成功率更高。此外他们还提到如果缺少一个扩散系统，改革也很容易流产。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;了解这些现实或许会让迫切希望变革的人被关起来。但与此同时，理解这些因素对于教育改革又是十分重要的。我也发现，无论是在一种自上而下还是自下而上的体系中，获得包括立法、社会和政府等各种力量的支持对于教育改革的成败起着巨大的作用（对于中国，这三个因素的顺序应该倒过来——政府、社会和立法，因为我们目前是一种大政府小社会的体系）。我们一直在抱怨教育，我们也有很多如何教授那样一心想要改变教育的人在努力，可现实是我们由中央组织教育专家制定的改革纲要通过“粗壮”但却“笨重”的自上而下的渠道传播逐级失真，而“纤细瘦弱”的自下而上的渠道经常会被切断。这也解释了为什么把2001年的颁布的基础教育课程改革纲要拿到现在来看，你会以为是今年刚颁布的新的改革纲要，因为里边的很多内容在10之后去看还只能是理想。到头来，对教育改革的认识，还是要回到对“教育是什么”的问题上来。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Walking on the altered side</title>
      <link>/blog/2010-03-09-walking-on-the-altered-side/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/change-ahead.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About forty years ago, Dr. James Finn gave a speech entitled &amp;ldquo;A Walk on the Altered Side&amp;rdquo; talking about an undergoing revolution in education powered by cutting edge technologies at that time, technologies that were best represented by computers. He opened up his discussion by quoting J. Robert Oppenheimer&amp;rsquo;s words,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One thing that is new is the prevalence of &lt;strong&gt;newness&lt;/strong&gt;, the changing scale and scope of change itself, so that the world alters as we walk in it, so that the years of man’s life measure not some small growth or rearrangement or moderation of what he learned in childhood, but a great upheaval.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Finn remarked, people&amp;rsquo;s attitudes towards instructional technology at that time ran all the way from apathy through antipathy to antagonism. Many people saw technologies as merely tools or a collection of gadgets that were trivial or even dangerous. Finn argued, &amp;ldquo;technology is not, as many of the technically illiterate seem to think, a collection of gadgets, of hardware, of instrumentation. It is, instead, best described as a way of thinking about certain classes of problems and their solutions.&amp;rdquo; I was deeply troubled when reading this, realizing that many times we as citizens of the information society are still fighting on the basic conception of technologies in education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I was intrigued by Allan Collins&amp;rsquo; envision of &amp;ldquo;a new revolution of education&amp;rdquo; after the move from apprenticeship to schools hundreds of years ago. In his book he listed seeds of a new system that challenge the position of schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Digital technologies such as computers, mobile devices, digital media creation and distribution tools, video games and social networking sites are transforming how we think about schooling and learning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning opportunities are much more abundant and distributed than ever. People become less dependent on the traditional school system(s) for education; more people realized the importance of learning that happens in informal settings and are putting increasing emphasis on education outside of schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past 8 months at OISE to me was a beautiful period of time when I could wander around many ways of thinking about a wide spectrum of problems in education. While I was made aware of topics such as critical pedagogy, social justice, and drama education, which are less studied in my home country, I also got opportunities to discuss with my supervisor the need of redefining assessment for the 21st century, to chatting with people on all sorts of buzzes on the Internet emerging in the past few months. I am breathing so much fresh air filled with possibilities at this moment that I feel poised to sense the steps of big changes in education. I expect to surf on the tide and contribute to the move with my own efforts. Although my thinking is only skimming the surface of the moving current, I do share the excitement and cautiousness of Dr. Finn forty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After almost one year of wandering around the OISE building, I suddenly realized it might be a time to settle down. Where is the spot I could build my doctoral research on? I seriously wondered. I started to think about questions like: what are important to learn? what is important for learning in this age? Groups of people in the world are embarking on the clarification and definition of a cluster of &amp;ldquo;21st century skills&amp;rdquo; and multi-literacies. I wish to learn the ways schools or the new system response to this shift. Is it another challenge, or a new opportunity? Another thing &amp;ndash; how could assessment respond to the change? &lt;strong&gt;With increasingly ubiquitous access to technologies in educational settings, how could technology help us deploy assessment that is formative and embedded in learning experience to help learners to progress on some facets of 21st century skills (e.g., creativity and critical thinking)?&lt;/strong&gt; These questions are currently all terribly ill-defined question for research. But I hope some of them could be meaningful and it&amp;rsquo;s not too late to embark on them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;北京五月的天不属于与茁壮的玉米苗笑脸相迎的白云朵朵，而属于漫天飞舞张牙舞爪的杨树的生殖细胞。印象中的五月不应当如此炎热，因为炎热往常在校园里聚起各种巫师模样衣服的人群，也该意味着楼下西门鸡翅每晚绵延到深夜的喧闹的酒瓶声。是的，炎热就意味着一群人该离开了，无论是在曾经师大的京师广场，还是如今燕园的各个角落。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岁月在无情地变迁。一年后，废墟不远的地方已经是笙歌四起。印象中四川五月的天特别美，或许是因为在我眼里四川的天就没有不美的时候。春意散去带来的是漫山遍野的葱翠，天也显得格外清新。一年前的现在还在焦急地给亲人和朋友联系，守着BBS，看着新闻报道暗自着急。一年前的震动唤起了人的巨大的力量让人心潮澎湃，感动和流泪之后对遇到的每一个人似乎都有了新的一份亲近。一年了，生活在坚强地继续，而生活也渐渐回归了原貌。地震掩埋了千千万万的人民，而“希望重建不要倒下一批一批的干部”。生存的需要得到满足时，人们的需求变成了更好地生存。生命受到威胁的一瞬间人人是平等的，但是当生命警报消除时，一切又渐渐回归原位。读了野夫的《余震绵延的大地》，对震动后的现实多了一点了解，同时也多了各种忧虑。地震不可能让北川、让灾区瞬间变成中国精神文明的示范区，那里是人均收入和人均图书拥有量远远低于北京的地方，广大的农民大众对生活的需求还是最大化对自己的补偿。ZF和人民，人民和利益群体，利益群体与ZF，又有了更多新的博弈。余震延绵的大地上，一切都还远未平息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;五月天空下的798比预想的要炎热得多，而今天却比预想的要冷清。去早了等不上下午的5.12纪念艺术展，只遇到了展示3000名北川学生大头贴和几本日记的小展厅。似乎这里的人们遗忘得更快。其实我真不懂艺术，更不懂绘画、雕塑、陶艺……但当走完几个展厅之后，突然觉得我好喜欢这里。荒诞和夸张，抽象和朦胧，戏谑和调侃，对人和事物的细致描绘，对生活和意识的深刻反讽，对内心和人性的投影和揭露……纵使自己看不懂艺术，但也这样喜欢着艺术。同时也开始羡慕起了玩艺术的人，虽然心头还是觉得不如玩学术靠谱，但十分妒忌他们拥有的肆意洒脱的心灵，而我一玩洒脱却可能立马遭到各种学究的无情挑剔。生活啊，多么的不同！如果再给我个机会，也一定要洒脱一把。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;五月，这个城市已经占有了我生命中的7大个五月，够了。在期许绵延的心里，又在勾画着就要新开始的一切。回想起来自己还只经历过两种五月，四川的五月葱绿自然，北京的五月明亮躁动。下个五月呢？据说多伦多的五月是值得期待的——因为那里五月时冬天刚刚结束。。。&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;喜欢教二楼，因为靠近繁忙的街道。喜欢教二楼，因为它给我带来宁静。累了，我喜欢靠着临近街道的窗户，看着过往的车辆和天桥上的行人。看着外面的繁忙，我的心里一片宁静。有时，会瓢泼大雨，透过雨帘，汽车疾驰的声音传来，清脆的、悦耳的。下雪了，一片白色，寒冷，冷风袭来。这时只能透过厚厚的玻璃和薄薄的雾气观赏这一切，犹如一个旁观者，看着来往过客。现在想来，我本也是教二楼的过客，匆匆，不留下痕迹（因为我不在课桌上刻字），保洁员用拖把抹去了我的脚印，后来着占据了我以前习惯的位置。
大二的日子，白天上本专业的课，晚上辅修课。有时会感到累了，于是去窗边看看，或者看一两句宋词。总之枯燥的自习室里也有乐趣，现在想来那时的我是稚嫩和自我满足的。就像下面这首词那样，些许调侃，但仅是百无聊赖者的自娱罢了。这就是大学学习的基调，我的蓝色的基调！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;杂词&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
一夜秋风，&lt;br /&gt;
叶尽黄，&lt;br /&gt;
小径踏满。&lt;br /&gt;
颓树缺月，&lt;br /&gt;
幽人望，&lt;br /&gt;
别恨心间。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @gunther2010neuralnet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gu ̈nther, F. and Fritsch, S. (2010). neuralnet: Training of neural networks. The R journal, 2(1):30–38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article introduces &lt;code&gt;neuralnet&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; an R package that trains supervised neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two other packages that deal with artificial neural networks at the moment: nnet (Venables and Ripley, 2002) and AMORE (Limas et al., 2007). nnet provides the opportunity to train feed-forward neural networks with traditional backpropagation and in AMORE, the TAO robust neural network algorithm is implemented. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;neuralnet was built to train neural networks in the context of regression analyses. Thus, resilient backpropagation is used since this algorithm is still one of the fastest algorithms for this purpose (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks can be applied to approximate any complex functional relationship. Unlike generalized linear models (GLM, McCullagh and Nelder, 1983), it is not necessary to prespecify the type of relationship between covariates and response variables as for instance as linear combination. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-layer perceptrons (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package neuralnet focuses on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP, Bishop, 1995), which are well applicable when modeling functional relationships. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package neuralnet (Fritsch and Günther, 2008) contains a very flexible function to train feedforward neural networks (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supervised learning (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are fitted to the data by learning algorithms during a training process. neuralnet focuses on supervised learning algorithms. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an iterative training process, the following steps are repeated: (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the modeling flexibility, hidden layers can be included. However, Hornik et al. (1989) showed that one hidden layer is sufficient to model any piecewise continuous function. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widely used learning algorithm is the resilient backpropagation algorithm. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resilient backpropagation algorithm is based on the traditional backpropagation algorithm that modifies the weights of a neural network in order to find a local minimum of the error function. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to speed up convergence in shallow areas, the learning rate ηk will be increased if the corresponding partial derivative keeps its sign. On the contrary, it will be decreased if the partial derivative of the error function changes its sign since a changing sign indicates that the minimum is missed due to a too large learning rate. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the traditional backpropagation algorithm, a separate learning rate ηk, which can be changed during the training process, is used for each weight in resilient backpropagation. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using neuralnet (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its usage is leaned towards that of functions dealing with regression analyses like lm and glm. As essential arguments, a formula in terms of response variables ̃ sum of covariates and a data set containing covariates and response variables have to be specified. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function neuralnet used for training a neural network provides the opportunity to define the required number of hidden layers and hidden neurons according to the needed complexity. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualizing the results (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the training process can be visualized by two different plots. First, the trained neural network can simply be plotted by &amp;gt; plot(nn) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second possibility to visualize the results is to plot generalized weights. gwplot uses the calculated generalized weights provided by nn$generalized.weights and can be used by the following statements: &amp;gt; par(mfrow=c(2,2)) &amp;gt; gwplot(nn,selected.covariate=&amp;ldquo;age&amp;rdquo;, + min=-2.5, max=5) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abrami, P. C., Bernard, R., Wade, A., Schmid, R. F., Borokhovski, E., Tamin, R., … others. (2006). A review of e-learning in Canada: A rough sketch of the evidence, gaps and promising directions. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology/La Revue Canadienne de L’apprentissage et de La Technologie, 32(3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This review provides a rough sketch of the evidence, gaps and promising directions in e­learning from 2000 onwards, with a particular focus on Canada. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, there were 726 documents included in our review: 235 – general public opinion; 131 – trade/practitioners’ opinion; 88 – policy documents; 120 – reviews; and 152 – primary empirical research. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Argument Catalogue codebook included the following eleven classes of variables: 1) Document Source; 2) Areas/Themes of e­learning; 3) Value/Impact; 4) Type of evidence; 5) Research design; 6) Area of applicability; 7) Pedagogical implementation factors; 8) A­priori attitudes; 9) Types of learners; 10) Context; and 11) Technology Factors. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that over half of the studies conducted in Canada are qualitative in nature, while the rest are split in half between surveys and quantitative studies (correlational and experimental). When we looked at the nature of the research designs, we found that 51% are qualitative case studies and 15.8% are experimental or quasi­experimental studies. It seems that studies that can help us understand “what works” in e­learning settings are underrepresented in the Canadian research literature. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found, generally, that the perception of impact or actual measured impact varies across the types of documents. They appear to be lower in general opinion documents, practitioner documents and policy making reports than in scholarly reviews and primary research (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of e­learning and technology use was highest in distance education, where its presence is required (Mean = 0.80) and lowest in face­to­face instructional settings (Mean = 0.60) where its presence is not required. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, among the Pedagogical Uses of Technology, student applications (i.e., students using technology) and communication applications (both Mean = 0.78) had a higher impact score than instructional or informative uses (Mean = 0.63). This result suggests that the student manipulation of technology in achieving educational goals is preferable to teacher manipulation of technology. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;professional development was underrepresented compared to issues of course design and infrastructure/ logistics; most attention is devoted to general population students, with little representation of special needs, the gifted students, issues of gender or ethnic/race/religious/aboriginal status; the greatest attention is paid to technology use in distance education and the least attention paid to the newly emerging area of hybrid/blended learning; the most attention is paid to networked technologies such as the Internet, the WWW and CMC and the least paid to virtual reality and simulations. Using technology for instruction and using technology for communication are the two highest categories of pedagogical use. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We examined 152 studies and found a total of 7 that were truly experimental (i.e., random assignment with treatment and control groups) and 10 that were quasi­experimental (i.e., not randomized but possessing a pretest and a posttest). For these studies we extracted 29 effect sizes or standardized mean differences, which were included in the composite measure. The mean effect size was +0.117, a small positive effect. Approximately 54% of the e­learning participants performed at or above the mean of the control participants (50 th percentile), an advantage of 4%. However, the heterogeneity analysis was significant, indicating that the effect sizes were widely dispersed. It is clearly not the case that e­learning is always the superior condition for educational impact. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-mode data was collected by Davis et al. (1941) in theirclassic study on theparticipation of Southern women in social events and later by a variety of researchers studying interlocking directorates from the 1970s onwards (e.g., Stokman et al., 1985). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breiger (1974) gave a systematic account of how to analyze such networks and introduced the idea of duality between persons and groups. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breiger’s approach, which we now often refer to as the projection or con- version approach was the favored technique, but it is now more common to analyzethe datadirectly as a bi-partite graphand make adjustments to account for the fact that some interactions are not possible. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These adjustments were first systematically examined by Borgatti and Everett (1997). There has been an increasing interest in two-mode networks in recent years mainly because there are many instances where the data is of this form. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next paper is by Everett and Borgatti (2013) and this paper challenges one of the basic statements often quoted by the net- work community that projecting two-mode data means that there isa loss ofdata.Theyacknowledge thatif onlyone projection iscon- sidered, or if the resultant projections aredichotomized then thisis true. But they contend that ifboth projections areused in any anal- ysis and these are not dichotomized that – except in a few very rare cases – there is no loss of data. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This special issue arose partly from a meeting specializing on two-mode data held at the VU University Amsterdam in October 2009, organized by Filip Agneessens, Peter Groenewegen and Ger- hard van de Bunt. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of subsequent papers consider statistical models for two-mode networks that try to explain the overall structure of a network by considering local processes. Both exponential random graph models (ERGMs, also referred to as p* models) (Wasseman and Pattison, 1996; Lusher et al., 2013) and stochastic actor- based models (SIENA models) (Snijders, 2001; Snijders et al., 2010) have classically focused on explaining the structure of one-mode networks by considering local forces, such as reciprocity, transitiv- ity and homophily. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opsahl (2013) examines the issue of defin- ing clustering coefficients for two-mode data (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although ERGMs for two-mode network data were first pro- posed by Skvoretz and Faust (1999), they were only recently extended to include attributes and clustering (e.g., Agneessens and Roose, 2008; Wang et al., 2009). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third paper by Kleinnijenhuis and de Nooy (2013) has at its heart a more complicated network structure. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;complicated bythe fact that the edges are valued with a measure of how extreme a party is (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second application of two-mode ERGMs by Conaldi and Lomi (2013) considers the local self-organizing principle of free/open source software (F/OSS) projects. By considering the bug-fixing of voluntary contributors as a two-mode network, they show how, in the absence of a formal structure, coordination can come about. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue not dealt with so far concerns multiplex two- modenetworks.Inmany cases differentrelationsbetweendifferent modes might exist. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another important issue relates to both the design of the data collection and the boundary specification problem in two-mode networks. Defining who is part of the network and who is out- side the network is often difficult. However, with two-mode data the additional problem arises that generally the boundary for one of the modes is defined by the boundary specified for the other mode. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another study, Zhu et al. (2013) consider what motivates people in online games to join a team. They study the emer- gence of teams in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) to understand the self-assembling mechanism of project team. Their results support the idea that homophily mechanisms play an important role in the choice of other team members. However, they also show that complementary expertise is an important reason for joining a team, as is the similarity in status (skill level) of the team members. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snijders et al. (2013) propose a SIENA framework for studying the evolu- tionof thetwo-modenetwork andthe co-evolution withone-mode networks. Studying the employment preferences of MBA students over time as a two-mode network, their study not only illus- trates the importance of looking at the evolution of this two-mode network (cf. Koskinen and Edling, 2012), but it also shows the importance of considering the co-evolution with the one-mode friendship and advice relations among these MBA students. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, in many cases the delineation of the border of a two-mode network isoften more arbitrary and requires considerable attention. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are a number of areas in which very lit- tle work has been done. First of all, all the examples in this issue were undirected. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the papers really engage with multi-mode networks in which there are more thantwo modes. Networks such as criminals bycrime byvictim are an example and yet few such datasets are collected and probably as a consequence even fewer specialist methods exist. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of distance learning fostered a shift towards the decentralization of the learning process, with higher effort put on course structure and content creation (p. 542)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is very difficult to identify what is the net contribution of each type of interaction to the learning process (p. 542)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hidden assumptions here? What is learning? Running against learning as interaction metaphor. (p. 542)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional in-class or face-to-face (F2F) learning has historically been a teacher-centric process (p. 542)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not true. Modality not necessarily linked to ways of teaching. (p. 542)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since in-class learning interactions are complex and informal by nature, it is difficult to systematically quantify them. (p. 543)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not clear why f2f interactions in a classroom become ’informal’. (p. 543)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning data analysis, most popularly known as learning analytics, is an emerging and promising – the estimated time-to-adoption horizon is between 2 and 3years (Johnson, Adams, &amp;amp; Cummins, 2012) – discipline in educational research. (p. 543)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;poor design&lt;br /&gt;
 Learning analytics is not ‘learning data analysis’. (p. 543)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2. A proposal for system-independent classification of interactions in VLEs (p. 544)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2.1. Based on the agent (p. 544)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first classification of interactions in learning processes to reach wide acceptance was proposed by Moore (1989), who identifies three different types of interactions associated to distance learning: (p. 544)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student–student interactions (p. 544)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student–teacher interactions: (p. 544)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student-content interactions (p. 544)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R1. Is it possible to define a system-independent framework of interaction data characterization for learning analytics? R2. If the answer to the previous research question is affirmative, is there any relation between interaction data and academic performance? R3. If so, do results depend on course characteristics, such as instruction mode? (e.g. VLE-supported face-to-face learning versus online learning). (p. 544)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method (p. 545)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2.2. Based on the frequency of use (p. 545)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Malikowski et al. identified three different levels of use and a total of five categories: (p. 545)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most used: this level groups interactions related to the transmission of content. The category includes delivery and access to learning resources, general announcements and information about course grades. (p. 545)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moderately used: this level includes two different types of interactions: creating class discussions and evaluating students. (p. 545)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely used: in this level we may find interactions related to the evaluation of courses and teachers – e.g. course/teaching quality or satisfaction surveys (p. 545)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2.3. Based on the participation mode (p. 545)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rovai and Barnum (2003) differentiate between two types of interaction: active and passive. (p. 545)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Data analysis (p. 546)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple linear regression was used to find the different relations between student interactions in the VLE and their academic performance. In the context of this research, the independent variables were the number of interactions of each type registered for each user on the VLE – i.e., the output from the Interactions tool – and the dependent variable – academic performance – was represented by the final course grade achieved by each student. (p. 546)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results (p. 546)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Table 1, there is a significant relation between the different types of interactions and the student’s academic performance – all of them significant at p &amp;lt; 0,01 except for transmission of content, (p. 546)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;context of VLE-supported F2F courses. Nevertheless, the results show that the three different classifications may be useful to predict student achievement in online courses. (p. 547)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 3 shows the final models for each of the classifications; criteria for exclusion in each step of the backwards stepwise regression was p &amp;lt; 0.1. According to the results, it follows that final students’ academic performance is determined, depending on the classification used, by: (1) the interactions they have in the VLE with their peers and – mainly – with the teachers; (2) the interactions related to student assessment; and (3) interactions involving active participation. Moreover, the values of VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) suggest that multicollinearity effects may be ruled out in this analysis. (p. 547)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tables 2 and 3, we have not been able to statistically establish any predictive model for final student learning outcomes in the (p. 547)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the final predictive model for online courses, the results from this study emphasize the importance of having teachers involved in the course (An, Shin, &amp;amp; Lim, 2009) and the promotion of active student participation as a lever to improve the learning process and its results. (p. 548)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, teacher– student interaction is generally the least scalable type of interaction (p. 548)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student–student interactions in online learning have been found to be the most important predictors of student success in prior studies (Macfadyen &amp;amp; Dawson, 2012). (p. 548)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedagogy&lt;br /&gt;
 Is exploration of interaction data without considering pedagogy ill-informed? (p. 549)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our research, we have been specifically interested in investigating the use of semantic technologies for learning analytics. Semantic technologies can enable meaningful linking of students’ learning activities and their interactions with the learning contents as well as with the other participants of their learning processes. To develop such a learning analytics tool, we made use of the ontology framework, named LOCO (Learning Object Context Ontology), which we developed in our previous work to allow for modeling of learning contexts (Jovanovi c, Gasevi c, Knight, &amp;amp; Richards, 2007). The key notion of LOCO is learning context, which is defined as an interplay of a learning activity, learning content, and participants (e.g., learners and/or educators); thus, LOCO enables us to represent and meaningfully interlink learning context data from different learning environments, or from different services (e.g., chat rooms and discussion forums) inside the same learning environment. On top of the LOCO framework and by leveraging semantic annotation (Popov et al., 2003) of diverse kinds of learning resources, we developed a learning analytics tool LOCO-Analyst.7 (p. 471)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher ADVisor (TADV) and Student Inspector are two examples of the tools, which focused on feedback provisioning through analysis of log data and visualization of the outcomes of such analyzes. The Teacher ADVisor (TADV) framework uses LCMS tracking data to extract student, group, or class models (Kobsa, Dimitrova, &amp;amp; Boyle, 2005). TADV relies on a set of predefined conditions to identify situations that require teachers’ intervention. When such conditions are satisfied, TADV informs teachers and provides them with an advice how to assist the students. TADV focuses on day-to-day activities of teachers. The Student Inspector tool analyzes and visualizes the log data of student activities in online learning (p. 471)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;environments in order to assist educators to learn more about their students (Zinn &amp;amp; Scheuer, 2007). (p. 472)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Zaine and Luo (2001) made use of novel data mining techniques for the analysis of access logs of an LCMS aiming at extracting and visualizing patterns that might be valuable for evaluating and interpreting learning activities in online courses. Similarly, TADA-Ed (Tool for Advanced Data Analysis in Education) combines different data visualization and mining methods in order to assist educators in detecting pedagogically important patterns in students’ assignments (Merceron &amp;amp; Yacef, 2005). These systems, however, focus exclusively on one type of learning activities (e.g., reading and exercises). The work presented in (BenNaim, Bain, &amp;amp; Marcus, 2009) aimed to develop a system that will assist educators to improve their feedback for students in adaptive tutorials, in cases when students encounter known “error-states” or when new “error-states” emerge. (p. 472)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CourseViz is developed to work with WebCT to visualize student tracking data (Mazza &amp;amp; Dimitrova, 2007); GISMO follows a similar approach for Moodle (Mazza, &amp;amp; Milani, 2005). Both of these tools try to assist educators in exploring social, cognitive, and behavioral insights of student activities in Web-based learning systems. (p. 472)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the above tools try novel ideas, it is not easy to judge how effective these are, unless a thorough evaluation is carried out. Only two systems mentioned above report their evaluation results at a sufficient level of details. (p. 472)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, both student and educator-centered feedback types provided by learning analytics tools can be divided into the two main groups (Melis &amp;amp; Ullrich, 2003): local and global. Typically, local feedback is an immediate response to some students’ activities (e.g., answering the questions of quizzes) in e-learning systems. On the other hand, global feedback is not necessarily immediate and is used to inform students and/or educators about a learning process as a whole or some of its sub-processes. (p. 472)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOCO-Analyst is a learning analytics tool aimed at providing educators with feedback on the relevant aspects of the learning process taking place in a web-based learning environment, and thus helps them improve the content and the structure of their web-based courses. It provides educators with feedback regarding: (1) all kinds of activities their students performed and/or took part in during the learning process; (2) the usage and the comprehensibility of the learning content they had prepared and deployed in the LCMS; and (3) contextualized social interactions among students (i.e., social networking) in the virtual learning environment. (p. 473)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generation of feedback in LOCO-Analyst is based on the analysis of user tracking data. These analyses are grounded in the notion of learning context, which is about a student (or a group of students) interacting with learning content by performing a certain activity (e.g., reading, quizzing, chatting) with a particular purpose in mind (Jovanovi c, Gasevi c, Knight, et al., 2007). The purpose of learning object context is to facilitate abstraction of relevant concepts from user-tracking data of various e-learning systems and tools. (p. 473)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOCO-Analyst is implemented as an extension of Reload Content Packaging Editor,10 an open source tool for creating courses compliant with the IMS Content Packaging (IMS CP)11 specification. (p. 473)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first evaluation of LOCO-Analyst (2006) (p. 473)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ1. To what extent do educators perceive a learning analytics tool useful for improving their course content and instruction in their everyday practice? RQ2. To what extent does the user interface of a learning analytics tool impact the perceived value of the tool? (p. 473)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study used the LOCO-Analyst tool and a questionnaire to evaluate all the features of the tool. (p. 474)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire consisted of 16 items (i.e., questions): first three items asked participants to specify their role and experience; nine items were related to the tool’s feedback features and functionality; and remaining four items focused on the GUI and intuitiveness features. Eight of the items (listed in Table 2) had two parts: nominal scale responses (i.e., quantitative) and open-ended (i.e., qualitative) part prompting the participants to give their observations in the free text form. (p. 474)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category Perceived usefulness of the tool for improving the course content/instruction Perceived value of the tool’s 3GUI General perception of the tool (p. 475)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we were able to categorize the themes and keywords into a coding scheme which consisted of three general categories: (1) Positive comment – expressing positive opinion without any concerns; (2) Positive comment with some observations – expressing positive opinion, but also has some observations that question some decisions or suggest some improvements; and (3) Negative comment– expressing either negative observations or some concerns questioning the decisions made in the design. As the participants’ comments were either related to the feedback type or the user interface, or were generic in nature, we further categorized the codes into 3 subcategories, namely: (1) Feedback feature – observations about specific feedback mechanisms supported by the user interface of LOCO-Analyst; (2) Intuitiveness – observations about the intuitiveness of the user interface; and (3) General comments – conceptual comments not necessarily directly applicable to the user interface and implementation of LOCO-Analyst. (p. 476)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly different coding scheme was applied to the question, which sought suggestions for improving the tool’s GUI (Q8). Each response was broadly recognized as either a suggestion or a compliment. Both of these categories were further sub-divided as: (1) mainly related to improving data visualization/graphics; (2) mainly related to improving interface design; (3) mainly related to improving annotations; and (4) other. (p. 476)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the dominant area for improvement is data visualization (S1) (p. 478)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvements in the second version of LOCO-Analyst (p. 478)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 5 A summary of suggestions participants gave in the 2006 survey for enhancing LOCO-Analyst’s features. No. Suggestion S1 Improve the data visualization. S1.1 Use graphics [for feedback presentation]. S1.2 Allow instructors to get insights by using different graphical chart, bar, XY diagrams etc. S1.3 Improve the visualization of analysis results [i.e., feedback] S1.4 Use more colors for representing data. S2 Improve the Graphical User Interface. S2.1 Keep the structure on the right hand side (RHS) of the tool window unchanged. [The RHS part of the tool’s user interface is used to display the feedback.] S2.2 Organize the contents in a way that the interface does not look overburdened. Try using more panels, windows, drop-down lists, if needed. S2.3 Use color codes and tool tips which pop up on hovers (such as on the hyperlinks) to give further idea of the feature or functionality available on clicking. S3 Further enhance the feedback. (p. 479)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2009 version of the LOCO-Analyst tool divided the user interface window into two vertical panels. These panels display the Reload editor on the left and the LOCO-Analyst functionalities on the right, as in the previous version. We used lower half of the left panel to display annotation feedback (Fig. 2A). (p. 479)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major improvement in the new version was the way we present and communicate feedback to the educators (i.e., data visualization). (p. 480)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second evaluation of LOCO-Analyst (2009) (p. 480)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ1. To what extent the implemented interventions do affect the perceived value of a learning analytics tool? RQ2. To what extent the variables characterizing the perceived utility of a learning analytics tool are associated? (p. 480)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study procedure was the same as in the 2006 study (Section 3.1.4), except hat besides the written instructions we also used video clips to introduce the tool and its functionality. (p. 481)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison of the two evaluations (p. 484)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This finding supported our expectations that visual representation of feedback would enable educators to quickly and easily get an overall insight into different aspects of the learning process. (p. 484)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the negative responses, we refer to two participants who questioned the usefulness of statistics. For instance, one of them stated: “you can determine that these students are passive, but how is this finding useful?” It is undisputable that statistics in isolation represent only one aspect of any real-world situation. To make more meaningful interpretations, we often need to look at the two or more statistics together. Therefore, LOCO-Analyst allows educators to consider different kinds of statistics related to either courses they teach or individual students attending their online courses. (p. 484)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss two main types of threats to validity commonly analyzed in empirical research – internal and external validity. With respect to internal validity of our experiment, we are interested in checking if some confounding factors significantly influence the analysis of the collected data (Chin, 2001). In our studies, two main confounding factors are difference in experience with using similar tools and motivation. (p. 486)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section is dedicated to the recent research that can be very valuable for the improvement of existing and introduction of new types of feedback provided by LOCO-Analyst. For example, Macfadyen and Dawson (2010) conducted an analysis of usage tracking data collected by an LCMS in order to determine the best predictors of students’ academic performance based on their activities in Web-based learning systems. Total number of posted discussion messages, sent email messages, and completed assessments are identified as the variables that can best predict (i.e., explain most of the variability of) the final grade of students. This empirical result is very important for LOCO-Analyst, as it can be directly applied to the feedback types listed in Table 1, and especially to those related to the analysis of social interactions. (p. 487)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics has been recognized as an important research topic for workplace learning, as well. However, in that context, common assessment approaches (e.g., formal exams) are not easily applicable (Murray &amp;amp; Efendioglu, 2007). A very important work in this domain is presented in (Macfadyen &amp;amp; Sorenson, 2010) who proposed Learner Interaction Monitoring System (LIMS) (p. 487)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o be able to identify such patterns from the data, we intend to make use of the wellestablished pedagogical frameworks that define and explain interactions in educational settings. In particular, we intend to rely on the Community of Inquiry framework (Garrison, Anderson, &amp;amp; Archer, 2000) and the Interactivity Triangle (Anderson &amp;amp; Garrison, 1998), which we have already made use of in our recent research to: i) explore the role and potential benefits of social semantic web technologies on interactivity in online learning environments (Jovanovic, Gasevic, Stankovic, Jeremic, &amp;amp; Siadaty, 2009) and ii) investigate the role and influence that the concept of online presence (Jovanovic, Gasevic, Torniai, Bateman, &amp;amp; Hatala, 2009) could have on collaboration in personal learning environments.20 (p. 488)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can conclude that the significance of this research is in providing clear evidence that a success of a tool for supporting educational processes can depend strongly on the visualization aspects of the system. Although this conclusion seems rather intuitive, in the technology-enhanced learning domain the focus over the last decade was predominantly on pedagogical, adaptive and responsive aspects of learning systems. We argue that an emergence of the learning analytics field is timely and further research is warranted on how we can utilize the existing knowledge from the human–computer interaction and visual analytics fields to improve the effectiveness of learning analytics (for both educators and learners) and study which particular interaction and visualization techniques work best for learning and education.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Ali2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ali, L., Asadi, M., Gašević, D., Jovanović, J., &amp;amp; Hatala, M. (2013). Factors influencing beliefs for adoption of a learning analytics tool: An empirical study. Computers &amp;amp; Education, 62, 130–148.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose and empirically validate a Learning Analytics Acceptance Model (LAAM) of factors influencing the beliefs of educators concerning the adoption a learning analytics tool. In particular, our model explains how the usage beliefs (i.e., ease-of-use and usefulness perceptions) about the learning analytics of a tool are associated with the intention to adopt the tool. In our study, we considered several factors that could potentially affect the adoption beliefs: i) pedagogical knowledge and information design skills of educators; ii) educators’ perceived utility of a learning analytics tool; and iii) educators’ perceived ease-of-use of a learning analytics tool. (p. 130)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the study is done with a sample of educators who experimented with a LOCO-Analyst tool. (p. 130)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educators, thus, require a learning system that provides learning analytics on their online courses that are both comprehensive and informative. (p. 130)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many approaches and tools for learning analytics have been proposed, there is limited empirical insights of the factors influencing potential adoption of this new technology. To address this research gap, we propose and empirically validate a Learning Analytics Acceptance Model (LAAM), which we report in this paper, to start building research understanding how the analytics provided in a learning analytics tool affect educators’ adoption beliefs. (p. 131)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, pedagogical knowledge and information design skills of individuals can influence their perception of the usefulness of learning systems (Bratt, 2009a, 2009b). Furthermore, McFarland and Hamilton’s (2006) refined technology acceptance model recognize prior experience as one of the context factors that could potentially impact the perceived usefulness of a system. (p. 131)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, studies have shown that decisions to adopt technology-based systems are influenced by the evaluators’ perceived utility of such systems (Bratt, Coulson, &amp;amp; Kostasshuk, 2009). The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) theory (Davis, 1989) – whose roots lie in Fishbein and Ajzen’s (1975) Theory of Reasoned Action – posits that perceived usage beliefs determine individual behavioral intentions to use a specific technology or service. (p. 131)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the relation between the ease-of-use belief and intention to adopt is not very clear, however. Some studies suggest there is a direct association between ease-of-use and intention to adopt (Davis, 1989; Gefen, Pavlou, Rise, &amp;amp; Warkentin, 2002). Others fail to report such an association (Warkentin, Gefen, Pavlou, &amp;amp; Rose, 2002). Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis (2003), however, suggest that perceived ease-of-use indirectly influences intention to adopt through perceived usefulness. (p. 131)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning analytics acceptance model – LAAM (p. 131)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Davis (1989), we can understand perceived usefulness as the degree to which an educator believes that using a specific online learning system will increase his/her task performance. Ease-of-use is the degree to which an educator expects the use of the learning system to be free of effort. We built a LAAM research model to investigate our research questions and hypotheses. (p. 131)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model is built on the measurement items (questions) included in our survey instrument listed in Table 1 (the survey instrument is described in Section 3.2). (p. 131)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen, L. K., Snow, E. L., &amp;amp; McNamara, D. S. (2015). Are you reading my mind? Modeling Students’ Reading Comprehension Skills with Natural Language Processing Techniques. In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Learning Analytics And Knowledge - LAK ’15 (pp. 246–254). doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1145&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2723576&lt;/sub&gt;.2723617&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying Coh-Metrix and LSA to assess students&amp;rsquo; reading comprehension. Could also be applied in collaborative online discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current study leverages natural language processing tools to build models of students’ comprehension ability from the linguistic properties of their self-explanations. Students (n = 126) interacted with iSTART across eight training sessions where they self-explained target sentences from complex science texts. Coh-Metrix was then used to calculate the linguistic properties of their aggregated self-explanations. The results of this study indicated that the linguistic indices were predictive of students’ reading comprehension ability, over and above the current system algorithms. These results suggest that natural language processing techniques can inform stealth assessments and ultimately improve student models within intelligent tutoring systems. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these positive findings, NLP-based systems still have plenty of room for improvement. One shared difficulty lies in the ability of these systems to represent students’ knowledge and overall ability levels. ITSs typically assess students’ abilities by evaluating performance on individual items, such as math problems or the quality of students’ explanations of a particular concept. This is a beneficial form of assessment, as it allows systems to provide item-level feedback, as well as to adapt content. One problem, however, is that these assessments provide little indication of students’ prior abilities at a more global level. In order to provide the most beneficial instruction and feedback, ITSs should assess students’ ability levels on numerous dimensions. The current paper extends previous research that aimed to model students’ reading comprehension abilities in iSTART [18]. Here, we utilize an automated text analysis tool to model students’ reading comprehension skills through an analysis of the linguistic properties of their self-explanations. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2 iSTART The Interactive Strategy Training for Active Reading and Thinking (iSTART) tutor is an ITS developed to train high school and college students on the use of reading comprehension strategies [15]. In particular, iSTART focuses on the instruction of self-explanation strategies, which have previously been shown to be beneficial for various high-level skills including problem solving, generating inferences, and deep comprehension of texts [27-28]. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the algorithm assesses self-explanations based on information from a relatively small window. This window includes the specified target sentence from the text that students self-explain and the surrounding sentences from the target passage. This algorithm assesses self-explanation quality using multiple word-based indices and latent semantic analysis (LSA) [30]. Lower-level information about the self-explanations is provided by the word-based indices, such as length and overlap in the content words. These measures help the system detect selfexplanations that are too short, too similar to the topic sentence, or irrelevant. LSA is then combined with these measures to provide a more holistic index of quality. This index provides information about the degree to which self-explanations include information from earlier in the text and from outside the text (i.e., prior world knowledge). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iSTART utilizes the information from these word-based and LSAbased indices to provide self-explanations a score from 0 to 3. A score of “0” indicates that a self-explanation is too short to accurately assess or that it contains irrelevant information. A score of “1” is assigned to self-explanations that are primarily related to the target sentence only. A score of “2” implies that a selfexplanation integrates information from the text beyond the target sentence. Finally, a score of “3” is associated with selfexplanations that incorporate outside information at the global level; thus, this self-explanation can include information that was not included in the text, or a self-explanation that focuses on overall themes that persist throughout the text. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.3 iSTART-ME (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2.1. iSTART Evaluation Algorithm iSTART utilizes a localized (i.e., sentence-level) evaluation algorithm that assesses the quality of individual self-explanations and allows the system to provide relevant feedback [4]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address student disengagement, educational games and gamebased features were incorporated within the system to develop iSTART-ME (iSTART-Motivationally Enhanced). Within iSTART-ME, the three main modules of iSTART (i.e., introduction, demonstration, and practice) remain relatively unchanged. However, the extended practice module contains a selection menu that allows students to interact with both educational games and game-based features (see Figure 2 for a screenshot of the game-based selection menu). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4 Text Analyses (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4.1 Coh-Metrix To assess the linguistic properties of students’ aggregated selfexplanations, we utilized Coh-Metrix. Coh-Metrix is an automated text analysis tool that computes linguistic indices for both the lowerand higher-level aspects of texts [38]. These indices range from basic text properties to lexical, syntactic, and cohesive measures. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.4 Current Study (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coh-Metrix calculates a number of basic linguistic indices, which provide simple counts of features in a given text. This category includes descriptive indices, such as the total number of words, parts of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs, etc.), and paragraphs in a given text. In addition, Coh-Metrix calculates the average length of words (average number of letters and syllables), sentences (average number of words per sentence), and paragraphs (average number of sentences per paragraph) within that text. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, students’ self-explanations from the iSTART and iSTART-ME systems were collected. These individual, sentence-level self-explanations were then aggregated across each of the texts that were read and analyzed using CohMetrix. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lexical indices calculated by Coh-Metrix describe the characteristics of the words that are found in a given text. Examples of these indices include lexical diversity (i.e., the degree to which the text contains unique words, rather than repetitive language), and the age of acquisition of the words (i.e., the age at which the words used in the text are typically acquired by children). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coh-Metrix is an automated text analysis tool that provides linguistic indices related to the lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and cohesion of texts. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntactic measures describe the complexity of the sentence constructions found within a text. Examples of these indices include the number of modifiers per noun phrase and the (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;incidence of sentences that are agentless and constructed in the passive tense. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohesion measures provide information about the type of connections that are made between ideas within a text; some relevant measures include: incidence of connectives, minimal edit distance (MED; indicates the structural similarity of the sentences in a text), and content word overlap (for adjacent sentences and all sentences). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is used to provide information about the semantic similarity of texts. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.5 Data Processing (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESULTS (p. 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Reading Comprehension Analysis (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pearson correlations were calculated between the Coh-Metrix linguistic indices and students’ Gates-MacGinitie reading comprehension scores to examine the strength of the relationships among these variables. This correlation analysis revealed that there were 29 linguistic measures that demonstrated a significant relation with reading comprehension scores. However, 5 variables were removed due to strong multicollinearity with each other. The 24 remaining variables are included in Table 1 (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an illustration, for a target text with p paragraphs and n target sentences, the resulting aggregated self-explanation file would contain p paragraphs and n self-explanations corresponding to the relative position of the target sentence (see Figure 3 for visualization of this aggregation) (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We calculated a stepwise regression analysis with these 24 CohMetrix indices as the predictors of students’ reading comprehension scores for the 90 students in the training set. This regression yielded a significant model, F(3, 86) = 17.624, p &amp;lt; .001, r = .617, R2 = .381. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three variables were significant predictors in the regression analysis and combined to account for 38% of the variance in students’ comprehension scores: lexical diversity [β =.38, t(3, 86)=4.179, p &amp;lt; .001], LSA paragraph-toparagraph [β =.32, t(3, 86)=3.519, p = .001], and average sentence length [β =-.22, t(3, 86)=-2.532, p = .013]. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current study, we used NLP techniques to develop stealth assessments of students’ reading comprehension abilities. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coh-Metrix correlation analysis revealed that a number of linguistic properties of students’ self-explanations were related to their comprehension scores. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlene recommended it to me, to inform me of my thinking on epistemological issues in KB and promisingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of belief-mode vs. design-mode epistemology is interesting. (This thesis integrates Marlene&amp;rsquo;s analysis of Kuhn and Perry research, clarifying that it represents a belief-mode epistemology.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thesis studies development of epistemological beliefs of graduate students in online courses. Epistemological beliefs were analyzed using: surveys, interviews, (reflective) learning logs, and KF note posts. Knowledge Forum log data (like note reading, writing, revising) are used to enrich the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, belief-mode epistemology is simply conceived as showing signs of caring for idea improvement. I believe work on this frontier can be further advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borokhovski, E., Bernard, R., Mills, E., Abrami, P. C., Wade, C. A., Tamim, R., … Surkes, M. A. (2011). An extended systematic review of Canadian policy documents on e-Learning: What we’re doing and not doing. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology/La Revue Canadienne de L’apprentissage et de La Technologie, 37(3), 1–30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, 138 policy documents from Canadian provinces and territories and several federal agencies, dated from 2000 to 2010, were identified, retrieved and analyzed using prescriptive and emergent coding approaches with the purpose of uncovering and describing areas of commonality and inconsistency and, hence, determining where discussions about e-learning are lacking. The review confirmed that Canadian policy makers view technology as offering various potential benefits to learners, but also revealed a troubling lack of specific details, consistency and coordination in facilitating the development of e-learning to fulfill these optimistic expectations. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies of technology integration in classrooms and technology-supported distance education have demonstrated the importance and benefits of technology as a way to equip learners for the future. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine whether these positive results yielded action by Canadian policy makers, we conducted a systematic review of policy documents concerning e-learning. This project is an extension of two relatively recent publications (Abrami, Bernard, Wade, Schmid, Borokhovski, et al., 2006; McGreal &amp;amp; Anderson, 2007) that describe e-learning in Canada in two distinct ways. One approach is empirical and the other is non-empirical, and they both make useful contributions to the ongoing dialogue among Canadians on how to increase adoption of e-learning practices. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current work attempts to further our understanding by providing a more comprehensive and systematic review of e-learning policy documents which goes beyond Abrami et al. (2006) and McGreal and Anderson. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abrami et al. (2006) study used a systematic review methodology to construct an “argument catalogue,” the results of which were touted as constituting “a rough sketch of the evidence, gaps and promising directions in e-learning from 2000 to 2005, with a particular focus on Canada” (p. 1). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McGreal and Anderson paper, “E-Learning in Canada,” is a narrative description addressing essentially the same issues described empirically by Abrami et al. (2006). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The provinciality of Canadian e-learning serves to highlight the inability of Canada to sustain national strategies and focus, such as those implemented in many other countries, due to the fractious nature of federal and provincial relations, particularly in education. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search Strategy and Document Selection (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education and training department Web sites and the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC) Web site were the primary sources for documents representing 10 provinces and 3 territories. In addition, the review targeted six selected federal departments: Canadian Heritage, National Defence, Health Canada, Industry Canada, Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the following categories: policies, vision statements, initiatives, and strategic plans and guidelines. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 107 documents were retained for review. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second round of data collection was conducted in August 2010 (covering the period from 2008–2010). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;31 additional documents were added to the data. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding Procedures (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two complementary approaches were used in coding the included policy documents. One approach used a set of predefined, prescriptive codes, while the second employed an emergent coding scheme allowing the categories to form as documents were read. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n both cases, the unit of analysis was an entire document, regardless how often a particular topic emerged within it. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argument Catalogue approach (Abrami, Bernard, &amp;amp; Wade, 2006) that seemed to be the best fitting tool for the purposes of the current review. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescriptive coding (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prescriptive categories (including relevant sub-categories) used in the coding process were determined through a larger-scale review of the literature undertaken by Abrami and colleagues in 2006, which included the following: (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Presumed benefits of e-learning (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Support for Implementation. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Collaboration. What kind of collaboration has been suggested or exists among the parties involved? (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Major areas of e-learning application (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Other (financial and organizational) issues (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) Type of learners and settings (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergent coding (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergent coding procedure was conducted in two phases: a review and extraction phase and a coding phase. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall Distribution of Documents (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, statements citing the benefits of and support for e-learning made up between 40% and 55% of the statements. Issues relating to collaboration (i.e., consultation, sharing) ranged between an additional 13% and 29% of the statements. The total percentage of statements regarding the details of implementation in the areas of “applications,” “other issues” and “learners,” ranged from 18% to 42% of the total number of policy statements. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely in agreement with previous reviews (e.g., Abrami et al., 2006), the “benefits of elearning” category was the most prominent theme in the documents, suggesting that elearning has value as a viable educational tool. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the most frequently mentioned subcategories were flexibility/accessibility (82 references), meeting social demands (78 references), interactivity/communication (67 references), and achievement (59 references). The issues of how e-learning can help reduce attrition/improve retention or improve the cost-efficiency ratio were discussed much less frequently (9 &amp;amp; 13 references, respectively). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “support for implementation” theme was second in frequency of occurrence. Within this theme, the use of online resources, naturally, was cited most often (68 references). The subcategory of professional development was mentioned 63 times, indicating that policy makers acknowledge and value teachers’ expertise and qualifications. The subcategory of logistic/infrastructure received the same number of references (63). These subcategories were followed by course development (50 references). Need for research or actual use of research findings was mentioned in only 32 documents. The two following forms of support for e-learning were the least frequently mentioned: creation of learning object repositories (22 references) and print-based resources (12 references). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration, another pre-condition for enhancing and supporting e-learning implementation, was the third most commonly cited theme in the policy documents. Within this theme, the majority of the documents emphasized the importance of the coordination of efforts involved in the preparation for and implementation of e-learning. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this was true within jurisdictions, there was inconsistency in educational policies with regard to elearning across provinces. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, coordination of efforts across agencies and institutions was the most prominent topic (74 references), followed by sharing resources (54 references) and involvement of other parties (44 references). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appeared to be strong consensus in the policy documents reviewed that learning with technology has great potential in a variety of areas. Connectivity with remote learners was most often described as the major objective for learning with technology (mentioned in 63 documents), whereas there were fewer references for literacy (43). Furthermore, numeracy and scientific reasoning were only mentioned 22 and 19 times, respectively. Finally, references to second language learning and home schooling were virtually nonexistent—10 and 5 times, respectively. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this category, the issue of financial responsibilities clearly dominated (47 references), followed by content and course standards (30 references) and more general financial considerations (25 references). By comparison, issues of ethics and security, certification and copyright, and enrollment eligibility received much less attention (24, 21, and 10 references, respectively). (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type of Learners This category, supposedly reflecting the major group of e-learning recipients and targeted educational settings, was the least represented topic in the reviewed documents (only 70 references, in total). Within this category rural and Aboriginal schools and special needs students were mentioned most often (26, 19, and 14 references, respectively), while (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;references to gifted students, for example, only appeared 2 times. The virtually nonexistent percentage of references to the average population of learners and urban schools could be attributable to their perception by policy makers as major recipients of e-learning activities by default, though it does not mean that e-learning implementation for this category of users does not require special attention, preparation, and regulation. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings Summary and Discussion (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the review revealed, Canada does not have a comprehensive or coherent approach to align e-learning’s vast potential with a clearly articulated and informed understanding of what it could or should accomplish. Instead, e-learning in Canada consists of loosely connected provincial, territorial and federal e-learning networks, education providers (public and private) and targeted initiatives. The consequences of this approach include duplicated efforts, fragmented goals and objectives, and sporadic and short-term initiatives. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the data suggest that there is a consensus among policy makers in their positive perception of e-learning and its potential to benefit learners. It is clear from this review that Canadian provincial and federal policy makers view technology as offering a variety of benefits to learners. These benefits include flexibility/accessibility, meeting social demands, interactivity/communication, and learner achievement. The extent of attention paid to support of e-learning (i.e., the conditions that are thought to optimize the chances for successful implementation) is also fairly strong, unlike the other coded categories. More specifically, support for implementation received a high level of attention with emphasis on professional training, Web-based resources, and logistic infrastructure. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the use of research to guide and support e-learning implementation was noticeably underrepresented. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of the lack of specifics is also evident with respect to application areas (i.e., in what ways and how much e-learning would benefit the development of literacy, numeracy, scientific reasoning, etc.). These issues were seldom addressed. Also, the types of learners who are targeted by and would potentially benefit the most from e-learning were addressed only minimally by the majority of reviewed documents. Finally, it was observed that little attention was paid to regulation and economic issues pertaining to e-learning. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following what McGreal and Anderson (2007) describe as “significant trends in Canadian e-learning that should be watched” (p. 4), this study found a number of areas requiring greater attention, such as the development of common standards (either technical or content-related) for establishing learning object repositories, blueprints for policies about credit exchange and acceptance, etc. Interestingly, a much earlier review conducted by Rossiter (2002) identified the steps necessary to implement a Canadian action plan on elearning, including encouraging research in the area of e-learning; identifying best practices; and developing comprehensive standards. Despite these recommendations, the majority of policy documents do not contain adequate insight on these issues. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, there is a need for higher transparency and better vocalization of educational policies. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, policies are intended to translate insights and consensuses based on research findings, public opinion and the balanced evaluation of needs and resources into realistic action plans. This review is just the first step in attempting to understand the current state of e-learning policy in Canada and how much of it has been lost in translation. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got interested in this paper because of the CORDTRA diagram mentioned at an AERA session. The main message from this article is discourse data need to be analyzed with multiple methods in order to get a clear understanding about what&amp;rsquo;s going on with collaborative learning or knowledge construction. In two studies, Cindy mainly explores three types of techniques: quantitative interpretation of fine-grained qualitative coding (Chi, 1997), qualitative interpretation of coarser level of data, and CORDTRA diagram that makes salient the relation of different discourse activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper makes me rethink our analysis on WoC data &amp;ndash;re-analyzing data from multiple angle will bring about a great paper from that project. Secondly, I am thinking about a research tool that allows researchers to toggle among different modes of interpreting results as long as all data are properly coded, etc. This presents to be an interesting design challenge with great value to the research community.&lt;/p&gt;

Sociocultural theories of learning place a great emphasis on analyzing discourse in order to
understand learning as well as stressing the importance of tools in mediating knowledge con-
struction (Cole, 1996; Engestro¨m, 1999; Palincsar, 1998; Pea, 1993).&lt;/p&gt;

Borrowing from the verbal data analysis
tradition of Chi (1997), I extend this methodology to analyzing group interactions to quantify
qualitative information. In addition, the quantiﬁed information and qualitative data can be used
in complementary ways to understand mediated collaborative learning. The goals of the analyses
reported in this paper are to be able to reliably understand the content and cognitive processes
that occur as students are trying to learn and the role that tools might play in mediating learning.&lt;/p&gt;

Luckin and colleagues took a diﬀerent approach to examining how alternative ways of struc-
turing hypermedia aﬀected how students engaged in collaborative knowledge construction
(Luckin et al., 2001). They coded all talk into task-oriented, non-task, and content categories with
high reliability. Rather than looking at the summary frequencies of these categories, they plotted
the occurrence of these kinds of talk and the software features in a chronologically ordered
representation of discourse and features used (CORDFU) diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

These sort of everyday learning practices have been studied using a variety
of techniques including discourse and conversation analysis, ethnography, and other qualitative
methods (e.g., Cazden, 1986; Cobb &amp;amp; Yackel, 1996; Koschmann, Glenn, &amp;amp; Conlee, 2000).&lt;/p&gt;

This analysis used both quantitative and qualitative
methods to examine the role of prior knowledge on the construction of a JPS.&lt;/p&gt;

This study uses both ﬁne-
grained coding and coarser qualitative analysis to capture both the general cognitive and social
characteristics of JPS construction, as well as illustrative examples that demonstrate phenomena
that go beyond the single turn. Together, they paint a rich picture of JPS construction.&lt;/p&gt;

The
categorical variables were coded on a turn-by-turn basis in the following categories: knowledge,
metacognition, interpretation, and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

The LK group ran
more trials (14) and took more conversational turns (2973) to converge on a satisfactory trial
design than the HK group (six trials and 1773 turns). The ﬁne-grained coding illuminates what
the students talked about in their conversational turns.&lt;/p&gt;

The category frequencies are extremely informative regarding some aspects of the knowledge
construction process, but do not fully address how students constructed a JPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 10

Initially, the students needed to construct a joint understanding of the task, software, and
relevant variables in the clinical trial design process. The HK group was able to do this more
quickly than the LK group, getting the big picture of the clinical trial design process after the
second trial.&lt;/p&gt;

One goal of this study was to examine how the
students collaboratively constructed knowledge. A second goal was to examine how use of a
representational tool helped mediate learning. Thus, this study focused on how content, process,
and tools interact during social knowledge construction. Three diﬀerent analyses were conducted
to address these goals. As in Study 1, verbal data analysis (Chi, 1997) was used to conduct a ﬁne-
grained analysis of the discourse and additional qualitative analysis was used to capture colla-
borative explanations. In addition, the CORDFU technique developed by Luckin and colleagues
(2001) was adapted to address the second goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 12
Author: bodong  Subject: Highlight  Date: 21/05/2013, 9:38:01 PM
Although this is a
brief snapshot of the analytic technique, it demonstrates how the ﬁne-grained coding and coarser
analyses complement each other and provide a more complete picture of collaborative knowledge
construction than either technique would alone. The ﬁne-grained analysis provides a view of the
data that summarizes the cognitive and social processes involved in constructing the JPS. It does
not convey all the richness of the sequence of events or social interaction. The second analysis
complements the summary analysis by demonstrating bigger units of activity and how these are
mediated by the tools that are available.&lt;/p&gt;

Students were expected to ask a substantial number of questions. The meta questions were
expected to be the major category for the facilitator. The distribution of questions is shown in
Fig. 1. Because these were experienced PBL students, they were also expected to pose many meta
questions. A total of 809 questions were asked. The students asked 226 short answer questions, 51
long answer questions, and 189 meta questions.&lt;/p&gt;

 The representation construction
activity lasted for approximately one half hour and was coded at a very coarse level as to whether
the drawing actions focused on anatomy and physiology, biochemistry, or clinical signs and
symptoms. To examine how the representation mediated the students’ collaborative knowledge
construction, a chronologically-ordered representation of discourse and tool-related activity
(CORDTRA) was constructed in order to gain an integrated understanding of how students used
the representation as a tool for collaborative knowledge construction (Luckin et al., 2001).&lt;/p&gt;

The CORDTRA diagram shows the relation of the discourse to the drawing activity. This
makes salient the nature of student talk as they switch between diﬀerent levels of representation.
At the junctures where student drawing activity switches from representations of basic science
processes to signs and symptoms, or between levels of science, the students engage in causal ela-
borations.&lt;/p&gt;

This excerpt corresponds to lines 347–374 on the CORDTRA diagram. Here the students were
getting closer to bringing the problem of demyelination to speciﬁc structures (the dorsal column)
and then mapping it onto the signs and symptoms that the patient is actually exhibiting. More-
over, they were monitoring the ﬁt between the symptoms that she is exhibiting and their theore-
tical descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

This analysis provides considerable information about
the relationship among variables and representation construction that the frequency counts do
not provide. The ﬁne-grained analysis summarizes the cognitive and social activity, but does not
capture the richness of the collaborative explanations that students construct. The analysis of the
larger units of discourse help shed light on this phenomenon, as well as providing some infor-
mation about how the representation served as a tool for the students’ collaborative thinking.
The CORDTRA diagram makes salient the relation of metacognitive talk and causal explanation
to the conceptual space covered in the drawing activity and supports making complex inferences
that might otherwise be diﬃcult. This allows exploration of the relationship between tool use (in
this case, a drawing) and collaborative knowledge construction. The diﬀerent methods provide
the opportunity to see more of the elephant than any one method does by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rough-summary&#34;&gt;Rough summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this article grasped my eyes. It appeared to be very relevant to what we&amp;rsquo;re discussing about designing assessment of/for knowledge creation. Things we&amp;rsquo;re interested include &amp;ldquo;how to evaluate idea rise,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;how to identify metadiscourse moves,&amp;rdquo; etc. The idea of tracing idea flow is definitely related to these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important contribution of this paper, I think, is introducing scientometric methods into analyzing learning/knowledge building processes. It&amp;rsquo;s actually not rocket science as it sounds like. The main thing in this method is its combination of social network and temporality. Using hyperlinks in a wiki (the case presented in this paper), the authors could build a network of artifacts, which are arguably regarded as ideas by authors. Then by laying out (revisions of) these artifacts on y-axis, temporal aspect is introduced in the analysis. After such a network (they call it &amp;ldquo;swim lane visualization&amp;rdquo;) is constructed, they could conduct &amp;ldquo;main path analysis&amp;rdquo; to find out which nodes are in the main path. This can further determine which artifacts are playing important roles in the growth of knowledge, while others are less important or newer. When focusing on individual profiles, different types of authors become distinguishable. The authors define three types: workers, collectors, and initiators, which represent three different roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique of &amp;ldquo;main path analysis&amp;rdquo; is quite inspiring for thinking of assessment for knowledge creation. The trickiest parts, I think, are to define ideas, and links between them. The authors directly uses each wiki page to represent an idea; and we can do the same thing for analysis of Knowledge Forum data&amp;mdash;using KF note to denote idea. This is quite natural but may need further scrutiny. For links, while hyperlinks in a wiki could be abundant, links in KF (including building-on, referencing, and contains) could become scarce in some cases. Referencing links are most close to the links used in scientometrics and this paper, but they&amp;rsquo;re usually scarce in student notes. Building-on links are useful for analyzing idea flow, but they will produce a tree-like or divergent structure, which makes main path analysis not meaningful (because the structure is not a network but a tree). Combining those different types of links could be possible, but again, it depends on the nature of links available in a specific KF database. Other options include &amp;ldquo;secondary&amp;rdquo; links such as those based on shared vocabulary as introduced by KBDeX. It will be interesting to further explore different possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think the main path analysis mentioned in this paper is interesting and promising for assessment for knowledge creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clippings&#34;&gt;Clippings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientometric methods are tailored for the analysis of knowledge artifacts,  most  prominently  publications,  and  their  authors.  One well-known method is the calculation of the h-index as a measure of  scientific  reputation  [13].  In  the  context  of  learning communities,  however,  individual  excellence  is  not  a  primary concern.  Rather  more  interesting  would  be  an  approach  to  the long-term characteristics and the dynamics of interactive learning environments. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hummon and Doreian [14] have proposed a method to detect the main  idea  flows  based  on  citation  networks  using  a  corpus  of publications in DNA biology as an exemplar. Our work reported in this paper takes this method, namely main path analysis, as a starting  point (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophical foundation of this view dates back to  Popper  [18],  who  explains  the  development  of  scientific knowledge as a constant process of emergence of new ideas and their  gradual  improvement  or  abandonment  after  discovering contradictory  evidence. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the temporal dimension should be regarded as a main component of  learning  analytics (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless,  the  field  of  learning analytics  still  needs  a  method  to  address  the  temporality  of learning processes quantitatively. Aspects that have to be further kept  into  account  include:  who  influenced  whom,  which  ideas were  taken  up  in  later  stages  and  which  were  not,  and  how differently  do  the  participants  contribute  to  the  overall  learning process. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,  the  modeling  of  the  overall process of knowledge development is challenging, as it should be kept track of the sequential relations between all the changes in the knowledge base. Any aggregation across time easily leads to a biased  analysis  of  individual  and  community-level  variables.  A longitudinal  study  of  different  points  in  time  is  also  an unsatisfactory  option,  as  it  misses  out  the  authorship  of  the changes  that  have  been  made  between  the  chosen  time  points. Especially difficult is to grasp the nonlinear flow of ideas that is characteristic of any learning process. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From  the  systemic  view  of  the  co-evolution model  of  individual  learning  and  collaborative  knowledge building  [5],  a  community  and  the  participating  individuals function as two different types of systems that co-evolve through mutual  fertilization. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the basis of the relation between the actor (or author) and the artifact (or product) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2  Main path analysis (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temporality is explicitly accounted for through  the  very  definition  of  a  directed  acyclic  graph  (DAG) where nodes are single publications and directed edges represent citations  between  publications. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main path can be described as the most used path in a citation network  taking  all  possible  paths  from  the  source  nodes  to  the sink  nodes. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting at the fictive source node, the main path is identified by successively  following  the  edge  with  the  maximal weight to the next  node  until  the  fictive  sink  node  is  reached. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This  paper  employs  the  search  path  count  (SPC)  algorithm  [2] that introduces one virtual source node and one virtual sink node and  links  these  to  each  of  the  actual  source  and  sink  nodes, respectively. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In  the  citation  network  of  scientific  publications  within one field, often one important publication is chosen as a starting point of the development of the field. This publication represents the  first  source. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main path analysis  [14] is a network analysis technique for the  scientometric  study  of  scientific  citations  over  a  period  of time. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using simple matrix operations such bi-partite two-mode-networks can be “folded” into homogeneous (one-mode) networks. Here, e.g., two actors would be associated if they have acted upon the same artifact. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNA has been criticized for eliminating  time. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a next step, a directed acyclic graph is constructed describing the complete flow of knowledge within a single domain in a wiki. Networks  of  hypermedia  resources  in  a  wiki  are  analogous  to networks of publications that are interconnected by citations. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach suggests using page revisions instead of wiki pages as nodes  in  a  DAG  extracted  from  a  wiki  data.  We  distinguish between two types of directed edges in such graphs: update edges and  hyperlink  edges. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;multiple  main paths analysis [16]. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to visualize the main paths of idea flows in a wiki we use the visual metaphor of a swim lane diagram introduced in Figure  2. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;knowledge flow between two wiki artifacts is established once by the initiating act of a hyperlink creation between them. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;differences  in  the  contribution  activity  of  authors  that  can  be interpreted  in  terms  of a division of roles of contribution (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;specialized in linking articles and emphasize the relations  between  different  topics.  They  can  be  regarded  as “collectors” (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isolated  and largely unimportant articles are not part of the main path (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“initiators”,  who  create  important  article revisions that are often referred by other articles later on. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;performing  many  successive  revisions and probably creating the largest amount of content in the article. We call them “workers”. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.4  Author profiles (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ongoing  EU  project  “SISOB” 3   which has the goal to measure the influence of science on society based on  the  analysis  of  (social)  networks  of  researchers  and  created artifacts. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  analysis  processes  described  in  this  paper  have  been integrated into our network analytics workbench. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It  appears  to  be  promising  to provide  moderators,  teachers,  tutors  or  the  productive  teams themselves  with  results  of  such  analyses,  in  order  to  support reflective  practices  [22]. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrade, A. (2015). Using Situated-Action Networks to visualize complex learning. In O. Lindwall, P. Häkkinen, T. Koschmann, P. Tchounikine, &amp;amp; S. Ludvigsen (Eds.), Exploring the Material Conditions of Learning: The Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) Conference 2015, Volume 1 (pp. 372–379). Gothenburg, Sweden: International Society of the Learning Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a quite interesting analytical technique, named Situated-Action Network, which is theoretically informed by sociocultural learning theories and methodologically grounded in SNA. Basically, it puts both subjects and objects into one network, and use principle component analysis to reduce data dimensions to 2 to reveal progression of learner. A nice intro to the technique and an interesting case study of using SAN for understanding learning progression in a piloting task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I am still about confused about the PCA part.. On which data is this analysis conducted? Using which algorithm?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this paper is to show how Situated-Action Networks (SAN) is a viable visualization tool for representing the learning that happens as a movement from peripheral to more engaged forms of participation in a social activity. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In shifting the unit of analysis from cognitive processes to social activity, this form of visualization accounts for the social dynamics, tracing the learner’s trajectory of participation from the periphery to a more engaged form of participation (Lave &amp;amp; Wenger, 1991). Building on Social Network Analysis (Wasserman, 1994), various descriptive network indices can provide useful information about the learner’s level of participation in the social activity. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take action as the unit of analysis. According to activity theory (Engeström, 1987; Leont&amp;rsquo;ev, 1974; Roth, 2007; Vygotsky, 1978), an action stands as the mediational link between a subject and an object. In this dialectical sense, actions are processes that connect two qualitatively different expressions of the same unit: in actions, subject and object are two constitutive elements that cannot be considered independently from each other (Roth, 2007). The idea that both subjects and objects are opposite but mutually constitutive parts of the same unit has important consequences for what, and how, subjects and objects are included in a representation of the learning process. In our analysis, subjects and objects are both represented as nodes in a network. This idea is not new, however, and some antecedents can be found in Latour’s Science and Technology studies (Latour, 1987) and some educational approaches inspired by his ideas (see for instance Shaffer &amp;amp; Clinton, 2006). Also, the theory of distributed cognition takes the system of cognition of both persons and objects as the unit of analysis (Hutchins, 1995; Hutchins &amp;amp; Klausen, 1996). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two main kinds of actions are envisioned in SAN analysis: a) instrumental and b) communicative actions. Instrumental actions refer to the use of artifacts – as a transformative material process (e.g., hammering a nail) or as the consumption of a source of information (e.g., reading a ruler or a scale). Communicative actions refer to linguistically achieved (i.e., verbal or non-verbal) intersubjective actions. In this case, language is the object. Vygotsky (1986) conceived of language as a tool that shared the same ontological status as that of a physical tool. For Cole (1996), this ontological status is clarified by using the term “artifact” to refer to both linguistic communication and material tools. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conception of learning that we bring to bear here can be defined as a micro-genetic change in the pattern of actions. A pattern of actions represents the regularities of the learner’s actions as well as the actions from all the other participants in the situation. That is, the connections between subjects and objects through actions in a regular manner. A micro-genetic change can be considered as a small developmental change that occurs as a consequence of an appropriation of the social practices (Cole, 1996; Roth, 2007; Vygotsky, 1978). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situated-action networks (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to create a raw data matrix where nodes and actions are recorded throughout segments of time (e.g., 1 minute or 10 second intervals). Second, a number of segments is subset depending on the starting and ending point of a socially meaningful activity (e.g., a 45 min class or a 10 min class activity). Third, an adjacency matrix is produced from the raw data matrix. And, fourth, a graphic representation is created. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparing several of these representations over various activities, these networks reveal informative changes in the pattern of actions. The thickness of the lines can be used to represent the density of the actions between pairs of nodes. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the novice’s learning trajectory toward more engaged, expert-like participation can be displayed by plotting each network’s center of mass in a 2-dimensional plot using the first two principal components. A principal component analysis is a statistical method that uses the eigenvalues from the adjacency matrix to create a linear combination of the nodes so as to cluster the most important ones (i.e., the nodes that carry the most weight) in the first dimension and a second linear combination with the second most important nodes for the second dimension. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the progression of the center of mass from our previous example would show that the density of actions of child B progresses (throughout the various iterations of the activity) towards that of child A in the first attempt (see Figure 3). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief example: Learning how to land an airplane (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situated-action networks (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, we have been asking questions about changes in individual pieces of information for the learner’s actions. Now, we ask how the overall functional model of actions has changed. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the pretest network (see Figure 6.a), when the novice played the role of the pilot for the first time and the expert the copilot, the pilot’s degree (i.e., the amount of the pilot’s actions) was 36, and the network density (i.e., the average degree across all nodes) was 27. In the posttest network (b), which was after five landing activities in which the novice played the alternate role of the pilot or the copilot, it is apparent that his node played a more engaged role in the network. The pilot’s degree for network (b) increased to 84, and the network density increased to 36.2. In addition, network &amp;copy; represents the activity when the expert played the role of the pilot. It shows a high level of engagement on the part of the pilot, with a high degree of 112 and high average network density of 40.6. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the participation progression can be seen in Figure 6.d, where center of masses are plotted along the first two principal components. The first component represents the amount of gaze at the instruments (and represents 35% of the variance) whereas the second component represents the amount of questioning (and represents 16% of the variance). It is apparent that the apprentice’s dependency on the instruments decreased from the preto the post-test activity as revealed by a lower posttest center of mass on the first dimension (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darkenwald GG and Hayes ER (1988). “Assessment of adult attitudes
towards continuing education.” &lt;em&gt;International journal of lifelong
education&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;7&lt;/em&gt;(3), pp. 197-204.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most definitions of attitude are similar to that proposed by Gagne and Briggs (1974: 62):&amp;lsquo;An internal state which affects an individual&amp;rsquo;s choice of action toward some object, person, or event&amp;rsquo;. Little wonder, then, that the construct of &amp;lsquo;attitude&amp;rsquo; occupies a central place in current theory on participation in continuing (or adult) education (Cross 1981;Darkenwald and Merriam 1982; Houle1984; Rubenson 1977). Attitudes are deemed important not only in affecting adults&amp;rsquo; participation in education, but also in determining their support of continuing education programmes in the community and workplace. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring attitudes (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitude measures (usually scales) are often poor predictors of behaviour. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rokeach(1968)formulated theso-calledtwo-attitudetheory,whichhasgainedincreasing acceptance by attitude researchers. In brief, Rokeach postulates that social behaviour is affected by twotypes of attitude: attitude towards an object (Ao) and attitude towards the situation in which the object is encountered (As). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitude towards an object has not,by itself, been found to exhibit a consistent relationship with behaviour. Attitude towards the situation must also be measured (within the same scale) if the A-Bcorrespondence is to be maximized. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seaman and Schroeder (1970), in one of the few studies of adult attitudes towards continuing education, found no relationship between attitudes and educational participation. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blunt (1983) contracted a new Thurstone scale to measure attitudes towards adult education. He found small but significant correlations between attitude and years of schooling, social participation, socio-economic status, internal-external locus of control, and participation in adult learning activities. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal objective of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument to measure adults&amp;rsquo; attitudes towards continuing education. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attitude was defined according to Rokeach (1968:112) as &amp;lsquo;a relatively enduring organization of beliefs around an object or situation predisposing one to respond in some preferential manner&amp;rsquo;. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitude scale (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in the construction of the Adult Attitudes Toward Continuing Education Scale (AACES) was the creation of an item pool. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty items were retained for a pilot instrument. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pilot scale was completed by 93 adult volunteers of diverse sociodemographic make-up. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final form of AACES has 22 items on a five point Likert scale. Seven items (as many as deemed pertinent) represent attitude-to-situation; the remaining items measure attitude-to-object. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioural index (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, a four-item Yes/No Bl was constructed. The first three items enquired about current participation, frequency of participation, and past participation; the last asked respondents if they had &amp;lsquo;ever suggested to another adult that he or she participate in some form of continuing education&amp;rsquo;. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence presented above indicates that AACES is a valid and reliable unidimensional measure of adult attitudes towards continuing education. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aturban, M., Nelson, M. L., &amp;amp; Weigle, M. C. (2015). Quantifying orphaned annotations in Hypothes.is (pp. 15–27). doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1007&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;978&lt;/sub&gt;-3-319-24592-8_2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An empirical investigation of orphaned annotations in Hypothes.is. The results are clearly stated in the paper. This paper highlights the significant challenge faced by web annotations &amp;ndash; the persistence of the first-order content that maintains the context of annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This paper has a light, useful intro to Hypothes.is.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we investigate the prevalence of orphaned annotations, where a live Web page no longer contains the text that had previously been annotated in the Hypothes.is annotation system (containing 6281 highlighted text annotations). We found that about 27 % of highlighted text annotations can no longer be attached to their live Web pages. Unfortunately, only about 3.5 % of these orphaned annotations can be reattached using the holdings of current public web archives. For those annotations that are still attached, 61% are in danger of becoming orphans if the live Web page changes. This points to the need for archiving the target of annotations at the time the annotation is created. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haslhofer et al. [9] define annotation as associating extra pieces of information with existing web resources. Annotation types include commenting on a web resource, highlighting text, replying to others’ annotations, specifying a segment of interest rather than referring to the whole resource, tagging, etc. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2013, Hypothes.is1, an open annotation tool, was released and is publicly accessible for users to annotate, discuss, and share information. It provides different ways to annotate a web resource: highlighting text, adding notes, and commenting on and tagging a web page. In addition to that, it also allows users to share an individual annotation URI with each other as an independent web resource. The annotation is provided in JSON format and includes the annotation author, creation date, target URI, annotation text, permissions, tags, comments, etc. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find that 27% of the highlighted text annotations at Hypothes.is are orphans, and only a few can be reattached using web archives. Further, we show that 61 % of the currently attached annotations could potentially become orphans if their live Web resources change, because there are no archived versions of the annotated resources available. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Related Work (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annotation has long been recognized as an important and fundamental aspect of hypertext systems [11] and an integral part of digital libraries [1], but broad adoption of general annotation for the Web has been slow. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been previous work in developing annotation systems to support collaborative work among users and in integrating the Open Annotation Data Model [15] with the Memento framework. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) [9] has been introduced to make annotations reusable through different systems like Hypothes.is. Before publishing OAC, annotations would not be useful if the annotated web pages were lost because annotations were not assigned URIs independent from the web pages’ URIs. By considering annotations as first-class web resources with unique URIs, annotation not only would become reusable if their targets disappear, but also would support interactivity between systems. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanderson and Van de Sompel [16] built annotation systems which support making web annotations persistent over time. They focus on integrating features in the Open Annotation Data Model with the Memento framework to help reconstructing annotations for a given memento and retrieving mementos for a given annotation. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other work [8,14] researchers built annotation systems that can deliver a better user experience for specialized users and scholars. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothes.is. The interface allows users to create different types of annotations: (1) making a note by highlighting text and then adding comments and tags about the selected text, (2) creating highlights only, (3) adding comments and tags without highlighting text, and (4) replying to any existing annotations. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 Conclusions (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we analyzed the attachment of highlighted text annotations in Hypothes.is. We studied the prevalence of orphaned annotations, and found that 27 % of the highlighted text annotations are orphans. We used Memento to look for archived versions of the annotated pages and found that orphaned annotations can be reattached to archived versions, if those archived versions exist. We also found that for the majority of the annotations, no memento exists in the archives. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article applying Process Mining (PM) on the study of self-regulated learning. Starting from discussing the importance of studying temporal and sequential information in self-regulated learning, this article moves on to introduce the key ideas of PM. Then it illustrates the application of PM, using a software called ProM v5, to study a group of students&amp;rsquo; learning in a hypermedia environment. The results mainly include comparisons, presented (visualized) in models, between two extreme groups representing successful vs. unsuccessful students. (The models look like results from lag-sequential analysis, even though they may be quite different according to the authors; the distinction is not that clear to me at this moment.) Overall, a successful one-stone-two-birds attempt to (1) introduce PM, and (2) investigate self-regulated learning. Many insights valuable for my ongoing work on self-regulated learning in MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Referring to current research on self-regulated learning, we analyse individual regulation in terms of a set of specific sequences of regulatory activities. Successful students perform regulatory activities such as analysing, planning, monitoring and evaluating cognitive and motivational aspects during learning not only with a higher frequency than less successful learners, but also in a different order—or so we hypothesize. Whereas most research has concentrated on frequency analysis, so far, little is known about how students’ regulatory activities unfold over time. Thus, the aim of our approach is to also analyse the temporal order of spontaneous individual regulation activities. In this paper, we demonstrate how various methods developed in process mining research can be applied to identify process patterns in self-regulated learning events as captured in verbal protocols. We also show how theoretical SRL process models can be tested with process mining methods. Thinking aloud data from a study with 38 participants learning in a self-regulated manner from a hypermedia are used to illustrate the methodological points. (p. 161)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;regulation should be seen in terms of events rather than in terms of traits and aptitudes. The phenomena worth explaining in this perspective are those relating to “the very actions that learners perform, rather than descriptions of those actions or of mental states that actions generate” (Winne 2010, p. 269). In need of explaining are regularities and patterns on the event level, rather than differences between learners in respect to their aptitudes (Winne and Perry 2000). Differences in learners’ (meta-/cognitive, motivational, emotional) dispositions are seen as (p. 161)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;less relevant than before for SRL research, with the possible exception of epistemic beliefs (Greene et al. 2010). Methodologically, this change in perspective has been progressing with an increasing focus on behavioral and verbal process data, and a decreasing interest in questionnaire methods (Azevedo 2009; Bannert 2009; Veenman et al. 2006). The interest in event data has been fueled by technical advances that make the recording of learning-related behavior on a level close to quantitative analysis almost effortless for the researcher, and largely un-obtrusive for the learners (e.g., Winne and Nesbit 2009). (p. 162)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contribution we hope to make with this paper is to demonstrate how a specific class of analysis methods known as Process Mining (PM) can be applied to a type of data often found in SRL research—(coded) think aloud data. We argue that PM methods are appropriate in cases where, for theoretical reasons or qua instructional design, students’ regulative behavior can be seen as being driven by a holistic model of a process, akin to what Winne (2010, p. 270) calls a “patterned contingency”. (p. 162)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Components and processes of self-regulated learning (p. 162)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-regulated learning involves a complex interplay of cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational regulatory components (Boekaerts 1997). According to recent theoretical approaches, regulatory activities during learning include orientation in order to obtain an overview over the task and resources, planning the course of action, evaluating the learning product and monitoring and controlling all activities. Research has revealed that successful learning corresponds with all of these regulatory activities (e.g., Azevedo et al. 2004; Bannert 2009; Manlove et al. 2007; Moos and Azevedo 2009). (p. 162)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commonly, cycles with the phases of forethought–performance–reflection (Zimmerman 2000) are distinguishable, even though more elaborated models exist (e.g., Winne 1996; Borkowski 1996). In this research, we are building on previous work on the temporal structure of self-regulated learning (e.g., Biswas (p. 162)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;et al. 2010; De Jong 1994; Hadwin et al. 2007; Kapur 2011; Schoor and Bannert 2012; Winne and Nesbit 1995). (p. 163)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an exploratory case study Hadwin et al. (2007) showed differences in the ways eight selected students regulated their learning over time by means of activity transition graphs. (p. 163)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Jong (1994) was able to show differences in learning sequences between high and low performing students by means of concordance analysis. He analysed the frequencies and patterns of self-regulatory activities of successful and less successful students and found significant differences in respect to the kind and variability in learning patterns. That is, the manner in which successful students used regulation activities (especially testing and monitoring activities) in much more flexible ways than less successful students. He also found that different kinds of tasks were related to different sequences in self-regulatory activities. (p. 163)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biswas et al. (2012) also identified different learning patterns for high vs. low performers by means of an exploratory data mining method. (p. 163)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group performance was predicted by 30–40 % on learning activities that were shown at the beginning of learning. In a recent study using lagsequential analysis, Kapur (2011) found that different temporal patterns of collaborative problem-based learning were significantly related to different group performance. (p. 163)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we conclude from these studies that students display a very high degree of variation regarding the sequential organization of their learning and regulation activities. Therefore, we argue that it is not appropriate to aggregate across all learners, but to compare subgroups that probably share a similar regulation behavior. (p. 163)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, research on temporal patterns in SRL is at an early stage and largely explorative at the moment. In absence of prior research and knowledge about detailed expected effects, an analysis of extreme groups is a suitable approach (Preacher et al. 2005). (p. 163)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, we expect that process patterns of high performers are similar to the ideal behavior described by SRL models (e.g., Zimmerman 2000) and that they show more active regulation, whereas the patterns of less successful students should be far from optimal regarding an ideal order. (p. 164)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process mining: how is it done and how has it developed? (p. 164)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous methods available for sequential and temporal analysis of SRL data (Sanderson and Fisher 1994; Langley 1999) so the question why it is necessary to introduce a new method needs to be answered. (p. 164)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With granularity, we are referring to the difference between treating a number of events that follow each other over time as (i) a sequence, as (ii) generated by a process, or as (iii) part of a narrative (Reimann 2009). (p. 164)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our motivation to suggest process mining as a method in SRL research is that it allows for the expression of the assumption that a sequence of events is generated by a particular process of self-regulation in a formal manner, and also, to test assumptions about such processes. (p. 164)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process mining (PM) refers to methods of data mining (Robero et al. 2010) that build on the notion of a process model. The purpose of engaging in PM is to identify, confirm or extend process models based on event data. PM is increasingly used in educational contexts, in particular in research on ICT-supported learning and teaching (Reimann and Yacef 2013; Trčka et al. 2010). (p. 164)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A process model in this sense does not refer to a cognitive architecture, nor does it mean that the processes described have to be mental or cognitive in nature. The reason that we nevertheless suggest to employ PM methods in the context of SRL research is that in principle, these methods are compatible with conceptualizations of SRL measured by event logs (Azevedo et al. 2010; Winne and Perry 2000) rather than as changes in (continuous) variables over time (Mohr 1982; Reimann 2009). (p. 164)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of model used in much of PM research is a very abstract one, namely variants of Petri Nets (Reisig 1985). (p. 164)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an important distinguishing feature of process mining compared to sequence mining, or sequential pattern analysis (Agrawal and Srikant 1995; Perera et al. 2009; Zhou et al. 2010); these methods, as well as stochastic methods such as lag-sequential analysis (Bakeman and Gottman 1997) do not contain the assumption of a (latent) process. (p. 165)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PM enable us to express that the process as a whole matters; it is a more holistic view of a process than a process-as-sequence view affords (Reimann 2009). The PM view of process is hence particularly relevant when we (p. 165)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;have reasons—hopefully based on theory—to believe that the performance of the system that generates the event sequence is driven by something that resembles a plan for action. In the context of SRL, this ‘something’ can for instance, be a learning strategy (a mental structure), or can be a resource given to the learner from outside, such as prompts (Bannert 2009) or a worksheet. In group learning, the equivalent would be a collaboration script (Kollar et al. 2006). (p. 166)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, very comprehensive software support is readily available for process mining analysis in form of the ProM workbench (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.processmining.org/prom/&#34;&gt;http://www.processmining.org/prom/&lt;/a&gt;). This software package, maintained at the University of Eindhoven, provides access to a large range of process mining and process analysis algorithms, under a unified framework for data import. (p. 166)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping&lt;br /&gt;
 How to map SRL strategies (2000 article) with MOOC behaviors? I guess this is the first step, and an important step/contribution, to take/make in our paper. (p. 166)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empirical study (p. 166)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants and procedure (p. 167)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dependent on how quickly they adopted the thinking aloud methods, students were tasked with carrying out three to five search tasks using a program similar to the one employed in the learning session. (p. 167)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning material and learning performance measures (p. 167)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning outcomes were measured on three different levels based on Bloom’s Taxonomy of the cognitive domain (Bloom 1956): Knowledge of basic terms and concepts (free recall method), comprehension of basic terms and principles (multiple-choice test) and application of basic concepts and principles in new situations (transfer test). (p. 167)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding scheme for analysing the learning activities (p. 168)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students’ verbal protocols were segmented and coded according to the coding scheme presented in Table 1. It is based on our theoretical framework of self-regulated hypermedia learning (Bannert 2007) and differentiates between the main categories metacognition, cognition, motivation, and others. Metacognition contains students’ utterances referring to orientation (ORIENT), goal specification (SETGOAL), planning (PLAN), searching information (SEARCH) and judgment of its relevance (EVALUATE), evaluation (EVAL), and finally, monitoring and regulation (MONITOR). Cognition contains the sub-categories reading (READ), repeating (REPEAT), and deeper processing, i.e., elaboration (ELABORATE) and organization (ORGANIZATION). The REPEAT event, when following a READ event, is best understood as ‘rehearsing’ the information read. The category motivation (MOT) includes all positiveand negative motivational utterances on task, situation or oneself. Finally others (REST) include task-irrelevant aspects such as questions to the experimenter about the overall procedure of the study or ambiguously utterances (‘not classifiable’) as well as phases of silence. (p. 168)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 168)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequency analysis of coded learning events (p. 168)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to research and theoretical assumptions of SRL processes (e.g. Zimmerman 2000), successful students should show an ideal regulatory behavior, whereas the process patterns of less successful students should be far from optimal. (p. 168)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEARCH (p. 169)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EVALUATE (p. 169)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EVAL (p. 169)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MONITOR (p. 169)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;READ (p. 169)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process analysis of coded events (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a further step we analysed the coded verbal protocols by taking the temporal order of regulatory activities into account, using the ProM-software V 5.0 (2008). (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fuzzy Miner algorithm, when applied to an event sequence, yields a transition diagram that is in essence quite comparable to the graphs suggested first in Winne and Nesbit (1995). (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parameters and metrics of the Fuzzy Miner (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fuzzy Miner Algorithm uses this data to generate a complete model which consists of nodes (event classes) and edges (relations between event classes) by taking the relative importance and the temporal order of all events into account. The algorithm uses two fundamental metrics, significance and correlation, for computing a process model for the given data set. (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significance measures the relative importance of the occurrence of event classes and of relations between events. For example, events which occur more frequently are assessed as more significant (Günther and van der Aalst 2007). Correlation is only calculated for edges and it indicates “how closely related two events following one another are” (Günther and van der Aalst 2007, p. 333). The basic concepts of significance and correlation are embedded in a metrics framework which calculates three primary types of metrics: unary significance (of nodes/event classes), binary significance (of edges/relation of two event classes) and binary correlation (of edges). These metrics are described in detail by Günther and van der Aalst (2007) and summarized in Schoor and Bannert (2012). (p. 173)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining process models of successful and less successful students (p. 173)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As theoretical SRL models postulate, one can see in Fig. 2 that successful students show a variety of metacognitive activities (ORIENT, EVALUATE, PLAN, EVAL, MONITOR). For successful students reading (READ) is mainly connected with monitoring (MONITOR) and elaboration (ELABORATE), however repeating (REPEAT) is also listed in their process model. There is a double loop of monitoring (MONITOR), reading (READ) and elaboration (ELBORATE). Less successful students (Fig. 2, right part) do not only show less events (as already listed in Table 4), but they also display less event types in their process model. For them, reading (READ) is mainly connected with repeating (REPEAT). Reading is also strongly connected with monitoring (MONITOR), and repeating (REPEAT) is also connected with elaboration (ELABORATE). (p. 174)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since current models of SRL operate mainly with the three phases of forethought– performance–reflection (i.e., Zimmerman 2000), we aggregated several of the coded categories in a further step as follows: The metacognitive activities orientation (ORIENT), planning (PLAN) and goal specification (SETGOAL) were combined into the new category analysis (ANALYSIS), and the cognitive activities elaboration and organization of information into the new category deeper processing (PROCESS). In addition, motivation (MOT) was excluded from further analysis due to low frequencies. (p. 174)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful students (left part of Fig. 3) show high frequencies of preparing activities (ANALYSIS) which are monitored (MONITOR). Reading (READ) is highly connected with monitoring (MONITOR) and deep processing (PROCESS). There are also evaluation activities (EVAL) which are connected to preparing activities (ANALYSIS). Moreover, there is a triple loop with analyzing (ANALYSE), monitoring (MONITOR), reading (READ) and deep processing (PROCESS). This model comes close to Zimmerman’s model of ideal SRL (2000). For less successful students the process model with aggregated categories (right part of Fig. 3) also includes 5 categories. However, their type, occurrence and relationships are quite different. Here we can see less preparing activities (ANALYSIS) which are connected to reading (READ). Reading (READ) is followed by repeating (REPEAT) and monitoring (MONITOR). Whereas successful students show deep processing activities when reading, the less successful students show mainly surface processing by repeating (REPEAT). There is a double loop between analysis (ANALYIS), reading (READ) and repeating (REPEAT). Their process model does not include evaluation (EVAL) which is different from successful students. (p. 174)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustrating model-testing approaches (p. 175)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing a full model (p. 176)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a process model was constructed in form of a Petri Net (Fig. 4), using WOPED (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woped.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.woped.org/&lt;/a&gt;) as the editor. WOPED saves Petri Nets in a format that can be imported into ProM. (p. 176)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a somewhat ‘ideal’ sequence of steps one would like to see learners engage in: (1) ANALYSE the learning task, (2) then perform any of the actions SEARCH, READ, PROCESS or REPEAT, (3) MONITOR your progress, (4) EVALuate if you are done, and stop or perhaps continue with a similar cycle. (p. 176)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to compare this model against the empirical trace data, we used the ProM module Conformance Checker; the methods that this software module implements, and the metrics it is able to calculate are described by Rozinat and van der Aalst (2008). The only metric used for our analysis is model fit. (p. 177)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we applied the Conformance Checker to our data of the less successful students in order to compare the full model (Fig. 4) with our empirical data (sequences of coded think aloud data from 6 cases). This comparison yields a fitness value of f=0.41, which can be interpreted as the model accounting for approximately 40 % of the observed event sequences. (p. 177)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One visualization is trace-based: Fig. 5 shows the first process steps for all 6 less successful participants, highlighting mismatches with the model. (p. 177)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another type of visualization is model-based (Fig. 6): the results of the analysis are over-laid on the model (see Fig. 4). The numbers on the edges of the graph correspond to numbers of traversals. The (red) numbers in the place representations (the circles) indicate how often the constraint at that place was not obeyed. (p. 177)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 7 shows the model view for the data from the 5 successful students (762 events). The fitness metric here takes a value of 0.48. Hence, it is only marginally better than the value for the less successful group. We can interpret this finding as saying that the differences between the successful and the less successful group, as far as they are due to differences in the temporal structure of their performance, are not expressed in the model. The successful group does not adhere (overall) more to the model than the less successful group. (p. 178)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing a partial model (a sequence pattern) (p. 179)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to perform partial model checking, that is, in order to check for the existence of sequences of events, one needs a language for sequence patterns. ProM provides such a language, namely LTL (Language for Temporal Logic). In this language, one can formulate logical formulae akin to first-order predicate logic, such as: Always_when_A_then_B, or Eventually_A_next_B. (p. 179)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 180)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to introducing selected methods of process mining, the aim of this paper was to analyse students’ processes of self-regulated learning. Besides detecting differences in frequencies of SRL events, we wanted to gain insight into the temporal patterns in students’ self-regulated learning. Our analysis contrasted the processes of the most successful and least successful students and considered whether these extreme groups differed in their SRL activities during hypermedia learning. (p. 180)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a methodological point of view we have only shown the tip of the iceberg: Process Mining comprises many other algorithms for sequence data and temporal data than those applied here, and also many more methods for model analysis and comparison. (p. 181)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we have focused only on process logic; we have not taken into account data that capture aspects of the process environment (such as what it read in the hypertext), nor have we taken into account quantitative temporal aspects (duration of events). For both aspects, specific analysis and data mining methods are available in the ProM-Framework (e.g., Rozinat and van der Aalst 2006). (p. 181)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the disadvantages of process mining models as introduced here is that they are not directly related to statistical testing, such as significance testing. (p. 181)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not discussing these methods of lag-sequential analysis further at this juncture as they are already described in the psychological method literature (see Bakeman and Gottman 1997, for an excellent introduction) and also as they work with a sequence view of events, rather than a process view. (p. 181)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of process measures considered is also of importance. Commonly, students’ navigation behavior is mined (Biswas et al. 2010; Winne and Perry 2000; Wirth 2004). (p. 182)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love this paragraph!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hesitate to recommend using the results of process mining or other event-based temporal analysis methods directly for instructional purposes. A strategy often suggested in educational data mining and learning analytics research is to use patterns in performance that have been found to discriminate between more and less successful learners directly for instruction. That is, in the sense that patterns found in more successful students are used as recommendations for future learners. This strategy is not only limited in scope—recommendations so derived can only work in the same environment and context in which they have been identified—but also raises ethical concerns; we know that inductively identified regularities can be spurious and brittle, and should critically reflect if we want to ground instructional advice on such a basis alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barab, S. A., Hay, K. E., &amp;amp; Yamagata-Lynch, L. C. (2001). Constructing Networks of Action-Relevant Episodes: An In Situ Research Methodology. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 10(1-2), 63–112. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327809JLS10-1-2_5&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327809JLS10-1-2_5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This paper introduces a methodology that&amp;rsquo;s grounded in Activity Theory and situated cognition, and based on ethnographic approaches and network analysis. It offers a very thorough and useful exploration of the need for analysis of knowing &amp;lsquo;in situ&amp;rsquo;, compared with traditional analysis of learning results / knowledge products. The argument is sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology itself is quite complicated and labor intensive. I found myself a bit lost when diving into detailed examples &amp;amp; trying to connect between them and earlier conceptual promises. This is due to the complexity of this methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: This paper offers great insights in 1) analyzing learning in situ; 2) writing about a proposed methodology. It also share a common interest with my current work on DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we advance a methodology for capturing and tracing the emergence, evolution, and diffusion of a practice, conceptual understanding, resource, or stu- dent-constructed artifact. The Constructing Networks of Action-Relevant Episodes (CN–ARE) methodology allows researchers to identify relevant data from a complex, evolving environment, and then to organize it into a web of action that can illuminate the historical development (evolving trajectory) of the phenomenon of interest (e.g., conception of an eclipse, applications of a mathematical formula, an evolving stu- dent-constructed Website). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this end, experiences are (a) sectioned into action-relevant episodes (AREs), (b) parsed down to codes in a database, and &amp;copy; then represented as nodes in a network so that the historical development of the particular phenomenon of interest can be traced. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this discussion includes an in-depth descrip - tion of the methodology along with its application to data sets. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing primarily on the learner-as-processor metaphor, there is a long tradition of methodological practices for assessing the learning process (e.g., Sax, 1989; Wittrock &amp;amp; Baker, 1991). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the individual or, more specifically, the mind of the individual as unit of analysis these traditional methods appear to deal more or less adequately with capturing the phenomena of paradigmatic interest (Brown, 1992; Schoenfeld, 1992). However, as one moves to a distributed perspective it is the complex and dynamic intersection of individual, environment, and activity over time that constitutes the unit of analysis. The focus is on learning and knowing in practice, not on some hypothesized reification of practice. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a central methodological concern in our research has been how to capture the trajectory of learning as it unfolds over the se- mester-long courses. In other words, rather than describing students’ ready-made knowledge at the end of the course we have been interested in tracking knowing in the making as the course unfolds. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there have been few attempts to develop methodologies for mak - ing sense of how learner understandings are constructed and are grounded across contextual particulars that occur over extended time frames (see Roth, 1998, for an exception). In fact, research in general tends to look at the products, not the pro- cesses of learning (Wittrock &amp;amp; Baker, 1991; Young et al., 1997). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;knowing about refers to a dynamic activity (trajectory of participation) that is dis- tributed across knower and that which is known and is spread out across extended time frames and multiple resources (Barab et al., 1999). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the participation trajectory over time that constitutes the unit of analysis when one adopts a situativity perspective of knowing and learning (Greeno, 1998). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is distributed spatially and temporally across multiple components (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in introducing a methodology for capturing and representing this “distributedness,” what we view as cognition, that this article is targeted. More specifically, in this ar- ticle we represent this trajectory as a network of activity—a network that allows for the inclusion (capturing) of material, individual, and social components over time. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our methodology allows us to capture occurrences distributed across time and space that influence and constitute a learner’s understanding, providing information on how environ- mental particulars contribute to evolving understandings. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this sense that we view cognition as distributed, embodied, and situated, and it is with the goal of capturing knowing in the making that we advance our Constructing Net- works of Action-Relevant Episodes (CN–ARE) methodology. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our first goal is to provide a description of the commitments and assumptions that underlie the design of our methodological approach. Our second goal is to describe this methodological approach. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a description of our methodologi - cal approach, the third goal of this manuscript is to show the application of the ap- proach to a particular data set, including touching on issues of trustworthiness, credibility, and usefulness. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THEORETICAL BACKGROUND (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognition as Situated (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is not some ontological substance that lies in peoples’ heads (or in the pages of textbooks) waiting to be actualized through cog- nitive processes. Instead, and consistent with our relational or situated perspective, knowing is an action-relevant term that delineates a person’s potential to act in a certain fashion. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly, knowing about 1. refers to an activity—not a thing. 2. is always contextualized—not abstract. 3. is reciprocally constructed as part of the individual–environment interac- tion—not objectively defined or subjectively created. 4. refers to functional relations—not objective “truths.” (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in our conception, knowing about and learning are simply differ - ent ways of describing the dynamics of evolving participation. Becoming knowledgeably skillful, from this perspective, is characterized by an individual’s in- creasing potential to build and transform relations with the (material, psychological, and social) world. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nodding (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning is thus fundamentally connected with and constitutive of the environ- mental particulars (including other people) through which it is actualized (Cobb &amp;amp; Yackel, 1996; Lave, 1997). Conceived in this fashion, the boundaries among indi- vidual cognition and the material and social world become difficult to identify. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to stretching cognition across multiple individuals, context, activity, and the cultural and material artifacts of the world, cognition also is spread across multiple time frames (see Kulikowich &amp;amp; Young, 2001, this issue; Roth, 2001, this issue). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;distributed across, the physical, temporal, and spatial occurrences through which her competencies have emerged. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify the argument, if the goal is to account for the historical development of knowing, then the methodology must capture and coordinate the multiple inter- actions, distributed across time and space, in a fashion that constitutes the trajec- tory of knowing in the making. It is the complex and dynamic intersection of individual, context, and activity over time that constitutes the unit of analysis (Engeström, 1993; Greeno, 1998; Lave, 1988). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nodding (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from a situative perspective, as - sessments and methodological approaches that focus solely on the individual learner are necessarily limited, and will fail to provide the rich contextual descrip- tions of knowing about that are so fundamental to situative or distributed concep- tions of cognition. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Methodological Grounding (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In advancing a new methodological approach, it is important to acknowledge intel- lectual history while at the same time illustrating where and why the approach be- ing advanced departs. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;has close ties with and must acknowledge the intellectual contribution of (a) inter- action analysis, (b) network approaches, &amp;copy; Activity Theory, and (d) the notion of tracers. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with interaction analysis, our approach has much overlap with the work of Jordan and Henderson (1995). In their work, they bring together groups of researchers to analyze videos. The goal in their work is to develop coding schemes, whatever they may be, for segmenting and building interpretations of the episodes depicted in the video. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in our approach we have committed to a particular coding scheme and our focus is on the relations among episodes, not simply the episodes themselves. In this sense, our methodology can be considered one particular instance of interaction analysis in which we have committed to a particular set of assumptions that inform our de- scription of what constitutes an episode and how we make sense of the network of interactions that these episodes form. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;network analysis was applied not just as a sociological exercise but as an analytical tool. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology discussed in this article integrates a network approach for cap- turing the distributed and situated nature of knowing in the making. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our methodology, the determination of what constitutes a node is informed by Activity Theory (Barab, Barnett, Squire, Yamagata-Lynch, &amp;amp; Keating, in press; Engeström, 1987, 1993, 1999; Leont’ev, 1974, 1989), (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When referring to “activity,” activity theorists are not simply concerned with doing as disembodied action but are referring to doing to transform some object, with a focus on the contextualized activity of the system (Barab, in press; Engeström, 1987, 1993; Kuutti, 1996; Nardi, 1996). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meditating components are tools (conceptual and physical), community, rules, and divisions of labor (Engeström, 1987, 1988, 1993; Kuttii, 1996). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Activity Theory, the context is not simply a container nor a situationally created experiential space, but is an entire activity system, integrating the partici- pant, the object, the tools (and even communities and their rules and divisions of labor) into a unified whole (Barab, Barnett, et al., in press; Engeström, 1993). Sim- ilarly, activity is not one aspect of learning and learning is not one type of activity; activity is learning and learning is activity. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity Theory has much to offer in tackling the theoretical and methodological questions that are cen- tral to theories that suggest cognition as practice-bound or -situated; for example, situated cognition. We have found Engeström’s characterization of the elements that constitute an activity system to be informative in terms of conceptualizing the constituent features and the boundaries of a node in our network. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with Activity Theory (Engeström, 1987, 1993; Leont’ev, 1974; Vygotsky, 1978), each one of these AREs include participants who act on particu- lar objects (individual and groups), as well as other mediating components such as tools, resources, and other participants—all in relation to the participant’s goals and intentions. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although nodes provide basic building blocks of our methodology, it is impor- tant to note that each component of a node (a participant’s understanding, a tool, an object being acted on), in addition to being a part of the current activity being ex- amined, is also constituted by previous instances of activity through which it was developed. For example, although a computer or a student-created inscription may be a tool in one network, on a previous occasion it may have been the object of ac- tivity (Barab, in press; Barab, Barnett, et al., in press; Latour, 1987). In other words, although nodes and their components exist in one network, nodes and their components are also constituted by networks; that is, nodes are both constitutive of and constituted by networks, reciprocally determining and being determined by the episodes in which they are a part. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our desire to capture the historical development and diffusion of practices, con- ceptual understanding, resources, and artifacts has much overlap with how others have applied Actor–Network Theory. Actor–Network Theory is a sociological ap- proach developed by Callon and Latour (Callon, 1987; Callon &amp;amp; Latour, 1981; Latour, 1987) to trace the emergence, evolution, and diffusion of scientific knowl- edge and artifacts across a society. The network approach “allows researchers to position actors within a larger context and reflect on their specific ‘mediating’ roles and to formulate appropriate practices of intermediation” (Gartner &amp;amp; Wag- ner, 1996, p. 187). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we may follow the trajectory of a nonhuman artifact or even examine the relations of a nonhuman artifact and a particular understanding, in our conception only humans are coded as actors. Our focus is primarily on tracing the events through which an individual or a number of individuals come to engage in a specific practice, under- stand a particular concept, evolve their use of a resource, or construct a particular artifact. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roth (1996) used network theory to examine how learning unfolds within stu- dent-centered classrooms. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to his research was the notion of tracers. Newman, Griffin, and Cole (1989) used the term tracer to denote a preexisting methodological strategy to find the “same activity” across different contexts. In our use, and consistent with the work of Roth (1996; Roth &amp;amp; Roychoudhury, 1993), tracers can refer to practices, conceptual understanding, and student productions (e.g., projects developed) that can be observed and fol- lowed over time. In Roth’s (1996) research, tracers were selected and then their history was followed through the network. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE CONSTRUCTING NETWORKS OF ACTION-RELEVANT EPIDODES METHODOLOGY (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing A Methodology (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we situate our method- ological discussions using a simplistic hypothetical example and then describe ac- tual data collected as part of our previous research to further illuminate the process and usefulness of our methodology (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Collection (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, data collection must also be situated in social interactions that are distributed (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;videotaping events provides a necessary historic re - cord of the event that (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, these observations are chunked into episodes, assigned labels, and organized as part of a relational database (described more fully later). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct classroom observation, we also use multiple video cameras that are directed at individual learning groups in a particular class- room so that the researcher can code and reanalyze “fast-flying” interactions (see Jordan &amp;amp; Henderson, 1995, for an in-depth description of shooting videotape for analysis). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To supplement and triangulate interpretations, our team also collects field notes, student-constructed artifacts, and carries out interviews with students and teachers. In particular, the data-collection efforts have been informed by other nat- uralistic accounts of classroom data-collection practices (Roth, 1996) (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In constructing and triangulating interpretations, we use the multiple data sources; however, the primary data col- lection procedures are direct observation and video recordings. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining Ethnographic Chunks: The AREs (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally, the identification or “chunking” the raw data into meaningful units or nodes is the first step in the creation of the network. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ana - lytical tools of Event-State and Causal Networks (Miles &amp;amp; Huberman, 1984), the nodes are defined as time-dependent events that “happen” (a meeting, a conversa- tion, or a mouse click) or they are defined as a state of mind (student frustration or pressure by parents). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our approach, nodes are equivalent to what qualitative re - searchers have described as “units,” “chunks of meaning,” or “ethnographic chunks” (Jordan &amp;amp; Henderson, 1995; Lincoln &amp;amp; Guba, 1985). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AREs are identified as activity occurrences that are judged to be a significant happening in the learning context, and are delimited by a change in theme, activity, subject, or resources. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What qualifies as a significant happening or a segment is somewhat subjective and spe- cific to the needs and interests of each particular research context. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lincoln and Guba (1985) described two criteria for selecting units of analysis: They must be heuristic and they must be the smallest piece of information about something that can stand by itself. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TABLE 1 Summary Labels for the Various Features That Constitute a Node (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue at hand A summary label that is chosen to identify the content of the node. It is the “direct” object of discussion or manipulation (the only way a practice can be considered an issue at hand is if it becomes the explicit object of discussion or manipulation). It can refer to an artifact, tool-related practice, or a conceptual tool or process. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initiator An individual or group (when engaged in a practice as a single unit) that is producing an action. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participant An individual who is involved in a node but not initiating the action. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource “Any piece of information, object, tool, or machine” that an initiator uses to carry out a practice (Roth, 1996, p. 191). In addition to technological tools, our definition of tool includes those of a conceptual nature (i.e., heat–color relations) and those of a social nature (e.g., community norms). An artifact is transformed to a resource when it is used by an actor as part of a practice. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice An activity that is carried out by an initiator who is using a resource. Practices can be tool related (i.e., embodied tool-related laboratory skills), scientific (i.e., calculating), instructional related (i.e., coaching), learning related (i.e., using an inquiry strategy), or conceptual (theorizing about quantum mechanics) and always involve the use of a resource. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our research, whenever we observed a change in the focus of an epi - sode (e.g., from eclipses to animation), the practice (from modeling to Socratic questioning), or the participants (from one student to another) we coded a new epi- sode. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining the Core Categories (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with Activity Theory, the issue at hand is the “object” of discussion or manipulation. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initiator is an individual (the participant) or group (when engaged in a prac- tice as a single unit) that is producing an action. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have not included nonhuman initiators; however, the contribution of nonhu- man objects (tools and resources) becomes fused and is a part of those networks in which they played an important part. The coding of these nonhuman objects is not as initiator but as issue-at-hand or as resource. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the fourth category we identified as a critical element is the tool or re- source. A resource is “any piece of information, object, tool, or machine” that an initiator uses to carry out a practice (Roth, 1996, p. 191). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final critical element of any ARE is the practice. The practice is an action carried out by an initiator or participant. There can be many different categories of practice within a network of AREs (N–AREs). Some of these categories of prac- tice are associated with specific types of initiators (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, each practice involves a specific resource (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethnographic Descriptions (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it has also proven necessary to add a field to our database for ethnographic descriptions that allow researchers to gain a rich contextual picture when later examining the nodes. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building Tracer Networks of Activity (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second main feature of a network is the links that connect the nodes. We con- ceptualize the links as anything that ties one node (an ARE) to any other node. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time links nodes his - torically, practices link nodes of similar practices together, resources link nodes of specific resources used together, and initiator and participant codes link people. These linkages through all the nodes of a given database can be envisioned as akin to a densely woven, highly complex “knot” of nodes and links. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question becomes, What links are productive to graphically represent within a network to address the underlying questions? (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our work, to bring order to this knot, we have developed a method to visualize this database in a fashion that enables us to explore the issues around the emergence, evolution, and diffusion of practices, concepts, resources, and artifacts occurring over extended time frames. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to this research is the notion of tracers, which we use to denote those facts, practices, student productions, or understandings that can be observed and followed over time (Newman et al., 1989; Roth &amp;amp; Roychoudhury, 1993). In our approach, tracers are identified through grounded theory development (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualizing Nodes and Links (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally, the visualization and representation of links starts with the visualization of the nodes on a time line. This process begins by developing graphs in which the y-axis represents ordinal, not necessarily ratio, time and the x-axis represents the node initiator. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These node bars are then abstracted into numbered circles, and positioned in the appropriate initiator column (see Figure 3). (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants and links are then added to the network. Beginning with partici- pants, in Figure 4 noncircled numbers have been added to the network to indi- cate additional individuals who were not initiators to a particular node. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with an explanation of Figure 4, this visualization illustrates a network of a tracer with links representing the connection of two nodes that share common facts, practices, student productions, or understandings, and are related historically through a common actor. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aforementioned discussion, we described the process of constructing N–AREs. The process from observation to analysis involves the following steps: 1. Collection of the data through direct observation and through videotaping. 2. Chunking the data into discernible units of analysis that we have described as AREs. 3. Recording information related to the specifics that constitute each ARE (see Figure 1). 4. Developing a visual representation of the data by recording the time dura- tion of each ARE for each initiator, and then abstracting these times into numbered circles that are sequentially arranged in an ordinal, not ratio, fashion (see Figures 2 and 3). 5. Selecting the particular issue at hand, practice, or resource to serve as the tracer. 6. Tracing the historical development of the particular tracer over time by shading in all the related nodes, adding observed links, and examining the path (see Figure 4). 7. Reexamining node descriptions as well as videotapes to build interpretation of the network. If possible, performing member checks to validate interpre- tations. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INSTANTIATING THE CATEGORIES (OUR RESEARCH) (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Context (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding Examples (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have found it most efficient to enter these subcategories into a database program in which the items can be accessed as pop-up menus (see Figure 1 for the coding form de- veloped for our VSS context). In addition, it is essential that these items be editable and that items can be added as new subcategories are identified for is- sues at hand, practices, initiators, participants, and resources. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;owever, in making the CN–ARE methodology a useful analytical tool, we have found it necessary to include ad- ditional fields to our form. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sort records (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptual richness is a rating on a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (nodes not related to course content)to9(nodes involving interconnections of ideas or systems-level understandings of the particular domain of interest). (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing Codes (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codes related to our categories and subcategories emerged through the process of grounded theory development (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding Scenarios as AREs (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these examples, we illustrate how we have parsed a scenario into separate AREs (nodes),3 and how we coded AREs. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, AREs were delimited by a change in theme, activity, or initiator. In other words, whenever we observed a change in the issue at hand (e.g., from eclipses to animation), the practice (from modeling to Socratic questioning), or the initiator or participant (from one student to another), we coded a new node. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreting Data (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have found it useful to carry out two types of data interpretations on the data- base of nodes generated through the CN–ARE methodology (Barab, Hay, Barnett, &amp;amp; Squire, in press): (a) as a database search tool to support frequency counts and grounded theory development (Glaser &amp;amp; Strauss, 1967), and (b) the N–ARE graphs discussed previously and further detailed later. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A database search tool. The database of coded interactions can simply be treated as a relational database, and thereby searched for various purposes. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting nodes to build networks. A more innovative application of the coded information is for the generation of N–AREs. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we have found it useful to use the database to locate tracer-related nodes and then to graph them in an ordinal fashion. This network provides an inscription, a graphical representation, that can then be used by the researcher to scaffold her in- terpretation as well as her presentation of the data. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing in on the practice of animation, they were able to document how the practice of animation, and the nested parent–child relations practice, diffused over the camp, frequently changing hands among students and involving independent ap- plication as well as more collaborative discussions. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the three example scenarios previously described, we now de- velop a N–ARE and then use it as an inscription to scaffold our interpretation of the data (see Figure 6). (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of the CN–ARE methodology is that it captures and represents cognition in situ, showing how cognition is contextually embedded and distributed across concrete experiences. This approach allows us to move beyond capturing ready-made knowledge to capturing the situated dynamics that constitute know- ing in the-making (i.e., students actualizing conceptual tools in their model and as part of their collaborative dialogue). (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRUSTWORTHINESS, USEFULLNESS, AND LIMITATIONS (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the Coding Scheme Trustworthy? (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of our ability to train a set of researchers who are then able to code segments with consistency, the trustworthiness of a coding scheme based on our subjective interpretations of such complex events is certainly not a straightfor- ward process. We are having to coordinate student gestures, dialogue, computer screens, and a class history all into a momentary judgement that occurs within the continuous flow of data. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the Coding Scheme Useful? (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one level, the use of the coding scheme to create a database of nodes is particularly useful for getting a broad look at an element, to search for particular episodes, for drawing con- trasts between groups (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more powerful function of the CN–ARE methodology is that it can be used to represent the historical development of cognition in situ, showing how cogni- tion is contextually embedded and distributed across concrete experiences. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Are the Limitations? (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order to actually capture these occurrences, it is necessary that researchers have large amounts of video data regarding student–student, stu- dent–teacher, student–tools, and student–resource interactions. Both capturing and analyzing this data are extremely labor intensive, and, in many situations, simply an impractical task (see Jordan &amp;amp; Henderson, 1995). Therefore, this approach is ap- propriate for researchers but will most likely have little application, at this stage, to the classroom teacher—although interpretations derived from analysis can prove useful to teachers. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where more automated process would help (now) (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other limitations include the time-consuming process of training coders, getting them properly situated in each new context, and the qualitative nature of determining the boundaries of a particular node. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous critiques targeted at network theory more generally. For example, in critique against the Actor Network Theory (ANT) approach, Engeström and Escalante (1996) stated: “In its search for convergence, irreversibilization, and closure, this kind of analysis overlooks the inner dynamics and contradictions of the activities of the various actors in the network” (p. 344). They further stated that “the concepts of trust and reciprocity, so central in new theo- rizing on network organizations, and the whole contradictory dialectic of coopera- tion and competition, are curiously missing in the vocabulary of actor-network theory” (p. 46). (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly psychological, cultural, and social factors are an important part of understanding situations when one adopts a situated perspective on what it means to know and learn. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have found that coupling the network story with a more general ethnographic account provides a much richer description of the context in gen- eral. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMPLICATIONS (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potential expansion of this methodology is to add quantitative information to the information coded at the node level—in a sense, quantifying the qualitative analysis of the data. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are at a time of paradigmatic shifts in ontology, epistemology, and peda- gogy, and researchers need to continue to look for novel techniques that are able to capture cognition conceived as situated. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, commensurate with recent epistemological shifts, it is a time for real and meaningful exploration, applying data analytic techniques that afford researchers rich descriptions of the process through which learners become knowledgeably skillful within the context of their participation.

&lt;p&gt;Bereiter C and Scardamalia M (2014). “Knowledge building and knowledge
creation: One concept, two hills to climb.” In &lt;em&gt;Knowledge Creation in
Education&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 35-52. Springer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the 1990s, the term “knowledge creation” entered the organizational sciences literature, conveying the idea that companies can not only accumulate and use but literally create knowledge that enables them to progress (Nonaka 1991; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995). At about the same time, the term “knowledge building” appeared in the learning sciences literature, representing the same idea (Scardamalia and Bereiter 1991; Scardamalia et al. 1994). (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In later decades the selforganizing character of knowledge creation/knowledge building was to become better appreciated (Bereiter and Scardamalia 2013; Li and Kettinger 2006), but its recognition as purposeful action persists. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children building up a cognitive structure that recognizes conservation of number under rearrangements of tokens do not know that is what they are doing and are not purposefully striving to achieve it. Knowledge creation/knowledge building is, in strong contrast, a type of deliberate, conscious action, which produces knowledge that has a public life. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lindkvist and Bengtsson (2009, Abstract) put it, “Once created, such knowledge is seen as having something of a life of its own, pregnant with possibilities for further development and use—to be explored collaboratively—in ways which are unimaginable and unfathomable.” (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We suggest that in practice the problem space for knowledge building is larger and more complex than the problem space for knowledge creation. It contains a wider range of goal states. Whereas the scope of corporate knowledge creation tends to be limited by the nature of the organization’s business, educational knowledge building has the whole world of human knowledge as its intellectual workspace. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ideas are the easy part,” says creative design group Fahrenheit 212 (2009). This is as true in schools as it is in businesses. Knowledge building is very much concerned with “the hard part.” Idea improvement is a core knowledgebuilding principle. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge building as an educational approach is fundamentally an idea improvement challenge; it is students taking collective responsibility for improving their ideas rather than leaving this as a task for the teacher. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distinctions That Matter (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the semantic proximity of “knowledge building” to such more familiar terms as “constructivist learning” and “inquiry learning” made it difficult for many educators to see what was distinctive about this particular kind of constructivist and inquiry-oriented activity.1 (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Phillips’ (1995) multidimensional classification of constructivist viewpoints, one of the dimensions has “individual psychology” at one end and “public discipline” at the other. Knowledge building and knowledge creation, as we use the terms here, are far out on the “public discipline” end of this dimension. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows us to distinguish activities whose sole value is in what they do for the learner from activities that have some larger epistemic value such as advancing the state of knowledge in a community. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be assumed that knowledge creation/knowledge building is going on just because learning is taking place through constructivist activities such as inquiry and guided discovery. And it is equally a mistake to infer that because community knowledge is advancing, individual learning for all students is progressing with it. Individual learning needs to be verified independently of the work that brings it about. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because many other educational approaches do not engage students in this manner, although they are similar to knowledge building in being “constructivist” and involving “inquiry,” the distinction between knowledge creation/knowledge building and learning is important for any in-depth description of contemporary approaches to education. (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paavola and Hakkarainen (2005) called knowledge creation a metaphor. In our view, there is nothing metaphorical about it (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe knowledge-building research and development need to distinguish between what we have termed “belief mode”3 and “design mode” in work with ideas (Bereiter and Scardamalia 2003). (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinction is blurred, however, in the writings of Nonaka and his collaborators. This is probably not so important for innovative work in organizations, where design mode clearly prevails. (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “belief mode” is derived from the traditional definition of knowledge as “true and justified belief” and thus is very broad in scope. (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belief mode encompasses everything from dogmatic proclamation and indoctrination on one hand to the most reflective and skeptical thinking on the other hand. We have tried alternative terms including “proposition mode” and “argument mode,” which avoid some misconceptions but promote others; so we remain with “belief mode” as the technically most accurate term. (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;classroom work with ideas, whether employing traditional didactic or modern inquiry methods, is almost exclusively carried out in belief mode, as it has been for millennia. (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, education must give serious thought to issues of epistemic agency, to the gradual transfer to students of the kinds of epistemic responsibilities traditionally reserved for the teacher (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Design Thinking” Mindset (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“design thinking” (Martin 2009) (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many others, however, treat it as a mindset, a way of thinking that becomes habitual and not something to be turned on only for certain purposes. This way of regarding design thinking is especially appropriate for knowledge building in schools. Instead of “doing” knowledge building in selected subjects at selected times, students should always be alert to the possibility of better ideas, better explanations, better ways of doing things, never quite satisfied with final answers, always looking for opportunities to design and redesign and to act on the basis of well-constructed ideas and understandings. (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be the most important thing they get out of school. (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a design thinking mindset is inherently social (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are not working independently on their own or group projects, although they may be working on their individual contributions to a common enterprise. The idea diversity that comes from their different contributions advances the collective state of the art in their community. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epistemology of Knowledge Creation/Knowledge Building (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken in its largest sense, Piaget’s “genetic epistemology” is a wide-ranging epistemology of knowledge creation, but in the simplified version that prevails in education and child development, it scarcely addresses knowledge creation at all. Can the epistemological side of Piaget’s theory of knowledge be made accessible to educators? A workable theory of knowledge is needed to help both educators and students deal with what Piaget (1971) saw as epistemology’s main challenge: “How can one attain to something new?” (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, alternative models: models based on complexity theory, which treat knowledge as an emergent of self-organizing processes (Li and Kettinger 2006); models incorporating Popper’s (1972) concept of “world 3,” which treats knowledge as having a sort of external, object-like existence (Gourlay 2006; Lindkvist and Bengtsson 2009); and models based on studies of dialogue and which recognize dialogue as not only a medium but a driver of concept creation and revision (Tsoukas 2009). (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our own efforts to develop a theoretical basis for knowledge creation incorporate all of these alternative conceptions, which happen to be highly compatible (Scardamalia and Bereiter in press). (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge-building theory, as we have developed it, is more in harmony with this third conception of knowledge than with Nonaka’s more mentalistic model, with its emphasis on tacit knowledge. There is no denying the importance of tacit knowledge and tacitexplicit knowledge conversion, but we see these as belonging more to a theory of knowledge mobilization (Levin 2011) than a theory of knowledge creation. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge-Building Communities and Technologies (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The products of knowledge building/knowledge creation can be understood as advances in the collective state of knowledge. It must be emphasized that these are advances in the Popperian type of knowledge referred to above (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals will learn in the process of advancing community knowledge, of course, and this will happen in any situation, not just in educational situations, but this learning is a by-product that needs to be evaluated separately from the collective knowledge advances. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;collective phenomenon affected by such group-level characteristics as morale, norms, and community goals. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two major kinds of innovation are required to provide such support: (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) Social innovation: transforming school classes into knowledge-building communities. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) Technology innovation: knowledge-building technology. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that, valuable as oral discussion may be in creative work with ideas, something beyond it is required in order to keep students’ ideas alive as objects of inquiry. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentic Knowledge Creation by Students? (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentic knowledge creation can range from tiny increments to world-changing discoveries and inventions. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experience assures us that students from the youngest years of schooling on can operate in design mode—typically producing small increments in community knowledge but occasionally major leaps to a new conception. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a group of elementary school students produces what they perceive as an adequate explanatory account of rainbows, there may be immediate gratification in feelings of accomplishment, but the usefulness of their theory is in serving as a starting point for a better theory and for helping advance in broader efforts to understand light and vision. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational Knowledge Building and Problems of Explanation (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Explanation-driven” learning (Sandoval and Reiser 2004) recognizes this connection, as does Schank and Abelson’s (1977) concept of “failure-driven” learning, according to which the failure of things to behave or turn out as expected drives a search for explanation. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are inclined to pursue explanation only to the depth necessary to deal with the problem at hand and then stop; or, as E. O Wilson put it (1998, p. 61), our brains evolved “to survive in the world and only incidentally to understand it at a depth greater than is necessary to survive.” (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing educational knowledge building on problems of understanding achieves two goals at once: It leads to deeper, more generalizable understanding of the “big ideas” that modern curricula endeavor to teach, and it cultivates the ability and disposition to push explanation seeking to the level necessary for innovative knowledge creation. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centrality of Knowledge-Building Dialogue and the Need for Supportive Technology (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creative role of dialogue is widely recognized in the knowledge creation literature (e.g., von Krogh et al. 2000) and is the centerpiece of Tsoukas’ (2009) theory of organizational knowledge creation. The importance of dialogue is no stranger to educational thought, either, dating as far back as Socrates and the type of understanding-seeking dialogue that still bears his name. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it must be recognized that there is more to knowledge creation than discourse, it is also true that if knowledge-building dialogue fails, knowledge building fails, and conversely if a dialogue succeeds in advancing from one shared knowledge state to a more advanced knowledge state, knowledge has been created. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Forum is a software environment, expressly designed to provide support for problem-oriented knowledge-building discourse, through scaffolds and mechanisms for building higher-level structures of ideas. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;provide stronger supports for such knowledge-creating processes as problem analysis, analogy creation, strengthening of explanations, and meta-discourse (discourse about progress and difficulties in the main knowledge-creating effort). In more general terms, supportive knowledgebuilding technology should help users move up the rungs of the ladder leading from encyclopedic knowledge presentation to increasingly powerful knowledge creation. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun in Knowledge Building (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They see knowledge creation as risky, which of course it is. It can fail, as every inventor, theoretician, or design-based researcher knows. Failure is part of the process and is valued as such by knowledge creators of all kinds. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the almost two million web documents referencing “play-based learning,” a mere 250 mention “play with ideas,” and there is a great deal of duplicated text among the 250. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Playing” with ideas means loosening the normal reality-based or task-based constraints and enjoying the freedom to make new combinations. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given enough freedom, young students will turn almost any academic activity into play. The challenge for pedagogy and technology designers is to provide supports and constraints that will shape the play along lines of useful knowledge creation without eliminating the spontaneity and fun. This is a challenge that the 48 C. Bereiter and M. Scardamalia social and technological innovations alluded to earlier can help to meet. They need to provide an environment that is enjoyable to be in while helping knowledge building to progress. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;social and technological innovations alluded to earlier can help to meet. They need to provide an environment that is enjoyable to be in while helping knowledge building to progress. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A Place for Everyone in a Knowledge-Creating Culture (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinctive hill that education must climb has to do with the long-term future of the ones creating the knowledge. On one hand, knowledge building needs to make students more knowledgeable and competent (that is the learning effect) while on the other hand providing them with a knowledge base and conceptual tools for further knowledge building. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Experience,” as Dewey (1928) defined it, has a progressive, feed-forward character like knowledge building. It is growth that enables future growth. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge building, once the concept is pried loose from learning, gives Deweyan “experience” an objective embodiment. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every student will go on in life to be a knowledge worker. Knowledge building in schools must not be geared only to preparing students for such work. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge building is not a solution either, but it can be a very positive step in the direction of enabling everyone to make a fulfilling place for themselves in whatever future unfolds. The positive step is helping every student to function in design mode and to bring a design thinking mindset to all kinds of situations, major or minor. Moreover, knowledge building in the classroom can help students learn to collaborate in design thinking, which is often necessary for it to succeed, and to hone communication and media skills that facilitate productive collaboration in design mode. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are formidable barriers to instituting knowledge building in education. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berliner, D. C. (2002). Comment: Educational research: The hardest science of all. Educational Researcher, 31(8), 18–20. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X031008018&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X031008018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: An argument against the sole promotion / endorsement of  randomized control trials / experiments in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Nicely argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “evidence-based practices” and “scientific research” men- tioned over 100 times in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 are code words for randomized experiments, a method of re- search with which I too am much enamored (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion of these issues leads to the conclusion that educational science is unusually hard to do and that the government may not be serious about wanting evidence-based practices in education. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government seems to be inappropriately diverging from the two definitions of science provided above by confusing a particular method of science with science itself. This is a form of superstitious thinking that is the antithesis of science. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard and Soft Science: A Flawed Dichotomy (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitions of Science (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I admire Richard Feynman’s (1999) definition of science as “the belief in the ignorance of authority” (p. 187). (p. 1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed- ucational research is considered too soft, squishy, unreliable, and imprecise to rely on as a basis for practice in the same way that other sciences are involved in the design of bridges and electronic circuits, sending rockets to the moon, or developing new drugs. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As politicians recognize that “facts are negotiable, perceptions are rock solid,” so there is no guarantee that science will reduce ignorance. But as long as argument is tolerated and unfettered, that possibility exists. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy-to-do science is what those in physics, chemistry, ge- ology, and some other fields do. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;really? (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;neither confuses science with method or technique, (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Power of Contexts (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they have more often found regularities in nature across physical contexts while we struggle to find regularities across social contexts. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each local context was different, re- quiring differences in programs, personnel, teaching methods, budgets, leadership, and kinds of community support. These huge context effects cause scientists great trouble in trying to un- derstand school life. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this hardest-to-do science, educators often need knowledge of the particular—the local—while in the easier-to-do sciences the aim is for more general knowl- edge. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing science and implementing scientific findings are so dif- ficult in education because humans in schools are embedded in complex and changing networks of social interaction. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 93 classroom contexts, 93 dif- ferent patterns of the relationship between evaluation anxiety and student achievement, and a general scientific conclusion that completely missed the particularities of each classroom situation. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;embedded- (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ness of educational phenomena in social life, which results in the myriad interactions that complicate our science. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decade by Findings Interactions (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still another point about the uniqueness of educational science, the short half-life of our findings. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of putting its imprimatur on the one method of sci- entific inquiry to improve education, the government would do far better to build our community of scholars, as recommended in the NRC report. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decade by findings interactions seem more common in the so- cial sciences and education than they do in other scientific fields of inquiry, making educational science very hard to do. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single method is not what the government should be promoting for educational researchers (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding and fostering the growth of the World Wide Web, both in engineering and societal terms, will require the development of a new interdisciplinary field. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lyzes the natural world, and tries to find microscopic laws that, extrapolated to the macroscopic realm, would generate the behavior observed. Computer science, by contrast, though partly analytic, is principally synthetic: It is concerned with the construction of new languages and algorithms in order to produce novel desired computer behaviors. Web science is a combination of these two features. The Web is an engineered space created through formally specified languages and protocols. However, because humans are the creators of Web pages and links between them, their interactions form emergent patterns in the Web at a macroscopic scale. These human interactions are, in turn, governed by social conventions and laws. Web science, therefore, must be inherently interdisciplinary; its goal is to both understand the growth of the Web and to create approaches that allow new powerful and more beneficial patterns to occur. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to model the Web; if we want to understand the architectural principles that have provided for its growth; and if we want to be sure that it supports the basic social values of trustworthiness, privacy, and respect for social boundaries, then we must chart out a research agenda that targets the Web as a primary focus of attention. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we discuss an agenda for a science of the Web, we use the term “science” in two ways. Physical and biological science ana- (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it turns out that human topics of conversation on the Web can be analyzed by looking at a matrix of links (7, 8). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engineering challenge is to allow independently developed data systems to be connected together without requiring global agreement as to terms and concepts. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading Web researchers discussed the scientif ic and engineering problems that form the core of Web science at a workshop (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite excitement about the Semantic Web, most of the world’s data are locked in large data stores and are not published as an open Web of inter-referring resources. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substantial research challenges arise in changing this situation: how to effectively query an unbounded Web of linked information repositories, how to align and map between different data models, and how to visualize and navigate the huge connected graph of information that results. In addition, a policy question arises as to how to control the access to data resources being shared on the Web. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular ongoing extension of the Web is in the direction of moving from text documents to data resources (see the figure). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although computer and information science have generally concentrated on the representation and analysis of information, attention also needs to be given to the social and legal relationships behind this information (9). Transparency and control over these complex social and legal relationships are vital, but require a much betterdeveloped set of models and tools that can represent these relationships. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web yesterday and today. (Left) The World Wide Web circa 1990 consisted primarily of text content expressed in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), exchanged via the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), and viewed with a simple browser pointing to a Universal Resource Locator (URL). (Right) Users of the Web now have a variety of top-level tools to access richer content including scalable vector graphics, the Semantic Web, multimodal devices (e.g., voice browsers), and service descriptions. These are expressed in extended markup language (XML), exchanged by newer protocols [e.g., HTTP 1.1 and SOAP (simple object access protocol)] and are addressed by uniform resource identifier (URI) schemes. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Web of human-readable documents, natural-language processing techniques can extract some meaning from the human-readable text of the pages. These approaches are based on “latent” semantics, that is, on the computer using heuristic techniques to recapitulate the intended meanings used in human communication. By contrast, in the “Semantic Web” of relational data and logical assertions, computer logic is in its element, and can do much more. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web science is about more than modeling the current Web. It is about engineering new infrastructure protocols and understanding the society that uses them, and it is about the (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for better mathematical modeling of the Web is clear. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;creation of beneficial new systems. It has its own ethos: decentralization to avoid social and technical bottlenecks, openness to the reuse of information in unexpected ways, and fairness. It uses powerful scientific and mathematical techniques from many disciplines to consider at once microscopic Web properties, macroscopic Web phenomena, and the relationships between them. Web sci- (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ence is about making powerful new tools for humanity, and doing it with our eyes open. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you enter your data into one of these services, you cannot easily use them on another site. Each site is a silo, walled o from the others. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universality is the FoUndation (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary design principle underlying the Web’s usefulness and growth is universality. When you make a link, you can link to anything. That means people must be able to put anything on the Web, no matter what computer they have, software they use or human language they speak and regardless of whether they have a wired or wireless Internet connection. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related danger is that one social-networking site—or one search engine or one browser—gets so big that it becomes a monopoly, which tends to limit innovation. As has been the case since the Web began, continued grassroots innovation may be the best check and balance against any one company or government that tries to undermine universality. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;open standards drive innovation (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is another important design feature. You do not have to get approval from any central authority to add a page or make a link. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By “open standards” I mean standards that can have any committed expert involved in the design, that have been widely reviewed as acceptable, that are available for free on the Web, and that are royalty-free (no need to pay) for developers and users. Open, royalty-free standards that are easy to use create the diverse richness of Web sites, from the big names such as Amazon, Craigslist and Wikipedia to obscure blogs written by adult hobbyists and to homegrown videos posted by teenagers. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open, royalty-free standards do not mean that a company or individual cannot devise a blog or photo-sharing program and charge you to use it. They can. And you might want to pay for it if you think it is “better” than others. The point is that open standards allow for many options, free and not. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people may think that closed worlds are just ne. The worlds are easy to use and may seem to give those people what they want. But as we saw in the 1990s with the America Online dial-up information system that gave you a restricted subset of the Web, these closed, “walled gardens,” no matter how pleasing, can never compete in diversity, richness and innovation with the mad, throbbing Web market outside their gates. If a walled garden has too tight a hold on a market, however, it can delay that outside growth. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, not using open standards creates closed worlds. Apple’s iTunes system, for example, identi es songs and videos using URIs that are open. But instead of “http:” the addresses begin with “itunes:,” which is proprietary. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep the Web separate from the Internet (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ut a third principle—the separation of layers—partitions the design of the Web from that of the Internet. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t make a link to any information in the iTunes world— a song or information about a band. You can’t send that link to someone else to see. You are no longer on the Web. The iTunes world is centralized and walled o . (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This separation is fundamental. The Web is an application that runs on the Internet, which is an electronic network that transmits packets of information among millions of computers according to a few open protocols. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other companies are also creating closed worlds. The tendency for magazines, for example, to produce smartphone “apps” rather than Web apps is disturbing, because that material is o the Web. You can’t bookmark it or e-mail a link to a page within it. You can’t tweet it. It is better to build a Web app (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers can improve refrigerators and printers without altering how electricity functions, and utility companies can improve the electrical network without altering how appliances function. The two layers of technology work together but can advance independently. The same is true for the Web and the Internet. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ElEctronic Human rigHts (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distinction highlights the principle of net neutrality. Net neutrality maintains that if I have paid for an Internet connection at a certain quality, say, 300 Mbps, and you have paid for that quality, then our communications should take place at that quality. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in August, Google and Verizon for some reason suggested that net neutrality should not apply to mobile phone–based connections. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A neutral communications medium is the basis of a fair, competitive market economy, of democracy, and of science. Debate has risen again in the past year about whether government legislation is needed to protect net neutrality. It is. Although the Internet and Web generally thrive on lack of regulation, some basic values have to be legally preserved. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;no snooping (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessing the information within an Internet packet is equivalent to wiretapping a phone or opening postal mail. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of future promise, which leverages the strengths of all the principles, is linked data. Today’s Web is quite e ective at helping people publish and discover documents, but our computer programs cannot read or manipulate the actual data within those documents. As this problem is solved, the Web will become much more useful, because data about nearly every aspect of our lives are being created at an astonishing rate. Locked within all these data is knowledge about how to cure diseases, foster business value and govern our world more e ectively. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free speech should be protected, too. The Web should be like a white sheet of paper: ready to be written on, with no control over what is written. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are actually at the forefront of some of the largest e orts to put linked data on the Web. Researchers, for example, are realizing that in many cases no single lab or online data repository is su cient to discover new drugs. The information necessary to understand the complex interactions between diseases, biological processes in the human body, and the vast array of chemical agents is spread across the world in a myriad of databases, spreadsheets and documents. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;transliteracy&lt;br /&gt;
 a good example that can be used as a motivation for CRII (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One success relates to drug discovery to combat Alzheimer’s disease. A number of corporate and government research labs dropped their usual refusal to open their data and created the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. They posted a massive amount of patient information and brain scans as linked data, which they have dipped into many times to advance their research. In a demonstration I witnessed, a scientist asked the question, “What proteins are involved in signal transduction and are related to pyramidal neurons?” When put into Google, the question got 233,000 hits—and not one single answer. Put into the linked databases world, however, it returned a small number of speci c proteins that have those properties. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked data raise certain issues that we will have to confront. For example, new data-integration capabilities could pose privacy challenges that are hardly addressed by today’s privacy laws. We should examine legal, cultural and technical options that will preserve privacy without sti ing bene cial data-sharing capabilities. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linking to the Future (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as long as the web’s basic principles are upheld, its ongoing evolution is not in the hands of any one person or organization— neither mine nor anyone else’s. If we can preserve the principles, the Web promises some fantastic future capabilities. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the latest version of HTML, called HTML5, is not just a markup language but a computing platform that will make Web apps even more powerful than they are now. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article affords a &amp;lsquo;fresh&amp;rsquo; look at the contrast between Piaget and Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s constructivist theories. The authors highlight that Piaget has not denied the role of social interactions in knowledge construction, so hasn&amp;rsquo;t Vygotsgy excluded the role of individual thinking. While conventional contrast focuses on the individual vs. social anitonomy of cognitive development, this article argues that a more proper contrast should focus on &lt;strong&gt;cultural mediation&lt;/strong&gt; and the rule of &lt;strong&gt;cultural artefacts&lt;/strong&gt; in construction. &amp;ldquo;In Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s view, processes on both the inter-mental and the intra-mental planes are necessarily mediated by cultural artifacts.&amp;rdquo; In contrast, there does not seem to have any clear counterpart in Piaget&amp;rsquo;s theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard discussions of the difference between Vygotsky and Piaget place a crucial difference in the proximal locus of cognitive development. According to the canonical story, for Piaget, individual children construct knowledge through their actions on the world: to understand is to invent. By contrast, the Vygotskian claim is said to be that understanding is social in origin. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;children construct knowledge through their actions on the world: to understand is to invent. By contrast, the Vygotskian claim is said to be that understanding is social in origin. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are (at least) two difficulties with this story. First of all, in principle, Piaget did not deny the co-equal role of the social world in the construction of knowledge. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Vygotsky, contrary to another stereotype, insisted on the centrality of the active construction of knowledge. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s strong assumptions about the active individual are reflected in his focus on practices such as speaking and thinking and are the focus of an extended treatment in Zinchenko (1985). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what gets left out of such discussions, and the element we want to emphasize, is the essential presence of a third factor in the process of coconstruction: the accumulated products of prior generations, culture, the medium within which the two active parties to development interact. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-primacy-of-cultural-mediation-p-3&#34;&gt;The Primacy of Cultural Mediation (p. 3)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural-historical psychology (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The special quality of the human environment is that it is suffused with the achievements of prior generations in reified (and to this extent materialized) form. This notion can be traced back to at least Hegel and Marx (&lt;sup&gt;1845&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1947&lt;/sub&gt;) and is found in the writings of culturalhistorical psychologists from many national traditions (Dewey, 1938; Durkheim, 1912; Leontiev, 1932; Luria, 1928; Stern, &lt;sup&gt;1916&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1990&lt;/sub&gt;); Vygotsky, 1929). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;historical psychologists from many national traditions (Dewey, 1938; Durkheim, 1912; Leontiev, 1932; Luria, 1928; Stern, &lt;sup&gt;1916&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1990&lt;/sub&gt;); Vygotsky, 1929). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their early writing on this subject, the Russian cultural-historical psychologists coupled a focus on the cultural medium with the assumption that the special mental quality of human beings is their need and ability to mediate their actions through artifacts and to arrange for the rediscovery and appropriation of these forms of mediation by subsequent generations. This view was always present in Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s writings, but it became increasingly important and well formulated in the last decade of his life (Minick, 1987). Indeed, in the year before his death he went so far as to write that the central fact about our psychology is the fact of mediation (1982, p. 166). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link between special mental quality of human beings and their actions and the cultural medium is particularly interesting. How does promisingness, or a promisingness culture, mediate students&amp;rsquo; epistemic beliefs (special quality), and then mediate their knowledge building actions? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language was the form of mediation that preoccupied Vygotsky above all others, but when speaking of signs, or psychological tools, he had a more extensive set of mediational means in mind (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this view, then, the development of mind is the interweaving of biological development of the human body and the appropriation of the cultural/ideal/material heritage which exists in the present to coordinate people with each other and the physical world (See Cole, 1996; Wertsch, 1991; for further discussion). Higher mental functions are, by definition, culturally mediated; they involve not a &amp;lsquo;direct&amp;rsquo; action on the world, but an indirect action, one that takes a bit of material matter used previously and incorporates it as an aspect of action. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one adopts this position, several implications come along with it. First, artifacts are recognized as transforming mental functioning in fundamental ways. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a view artifacts clearly do not serve simply to facilitate mental processes that would otherwise exist. Instead, they fundamentally shape and transform them. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second implication of this general position is that all psychological functions begin, and to a large extent remain, culturally, historically, and institutionally situated and context specific. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely there is no tool that is adequate to all tasks, and there is no universally appropriate form of cultural mediation. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third implication of making cultural mediation central to mind and mental development is that the meaning of an action and of a context are not specifiable independent of each other. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth is the implication that mind is no longer to be located entirely inside the head; higher psychological functions are transactions that include the biological individual, the cultural mediational artifacts, (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the culturally structured social and natural environments of which persons are a part. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-origins-p-8&#34;&gt;Social Origins (p. 8)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Vygotsky, like Piaget, the relationship between the individual and the social is necessarily relational. However, by placing cultural mediation at the center of adult cognition and the process of cognitive development, social origins take on a special importance in Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s theories that is less symmetrical than Piaget&amp;rsquo;s notion of social equilibration as &amp;lsquo;resulting from the interplay of the operations that enter into all cooperation&amp;rsquo;. For Vygotsky and cultural-historical theorists more generally, the social world does have primacy over the individual in a very special sense. Society is the bearer of the cultural heritage without which the development of mind is impossible. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s view, processes on both the inter-mental and the intra-mental planes are necessarily mediated by cultural artifacts. His comment that word meaning is &amp;lsquo;both [speech and thinking] at one and the same time; it is a unit of verbal thinking&amp;rsquo; (1987, p.47) is quite telling in this connection. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact the very boundary between social and individual, a boundary that has defined much of our thinking in psychology, comes into question in Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s writings. Just as the mind does not stop with the skin in his view, the relationship between individual and social environment is much more dynamic than the overly simple division we so often tacitly assume. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, social interaction is not a direct, transparent, or unmediated process. Instead, it takes place in an artifact-saturated medium, including language, and this is a point that Vygotsky took into account in a thoroughgoing manner. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mind-is-distributed-p-10&#34;&gt;Mind is distributed (p. 10)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a striking similarity to the recent movement in cognitive science associated with the notion of distributed cognition and situated learning (Bechtel, 1993; Clark, in press; Cole &amp;amp; Engestrom, 1993; Hutchins, 1995; Lave &amp;amp; Wenger, 1991; et passim). Central to this line of thought is the effort to create an external symbol system approach that &amp;lsquo;moves formal symbols &amp;hellip; out of the head and locate them in the environment of the system&amp;rsquo;. Clark (in press) has argued for a position which recognizes the need to give &amp;lsquo;more attention, and credit, to the many ways in which networks can learn to exploit external environmental structures so as to simplify and transform the nature of internal processing&amp;rsquo; (p.16). Related arguments have been put forth by Rumelhart, Smolensky, and Hinton (1986); Clark (1989); Dennett (1991) and Hutchins (1995). In short, Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s position on the centrality of artifacts, including external artifacts, in human mental processes is one that has great resonance in contemporary cognitive science as well as the human sciences more broadly. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we believe that discussions of these two figures&amp;rsquo; accounts of mind and its boundaries are not well served by overly rehearsed debates about the primacy of the individual or the social. Instead, we have argued that the more interesting contrast between them concerns the role of cultural artifacts in constituting the two poles of the individual-social antimony. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Vygotsky, such artifacts play a central role in elaborating an account of what and where mind is. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive review of the effectiveness of feedback in classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT This article is a review of the literature on classroom formative assessment. Several studies show firm evidence that innovations designed to strengthen the frequent feedback that students receive about their learning yield substantial learning gains. The perceptions of students and their role in self-assessment are considered alongside analysis of the strategies used by teachers and the formative strategies incorporated in such systemic approaches as mastery learning. There follows a more detailed and theoretical analysis of the nature of feedback, which provides a basis for a discussion of the development of theoretical models for formative assessment and of the prospects for the improvement of practice. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal reason for this is that the term formative assessment does not have a tightly defined and widely accepted meaning. In this review, it is to be interpreted as encompassing all those activities undertaken by teachers, and/or by their students, which provide information to be used as feedback to modify the (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;teaching and learning activities in which they are engaged. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulo Blikstein&amp;rsquo;s intro to a series of his preliminary work on multimodal learning analytics. I think he is credited as the creator of this line of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presented a series of proof-of-concept studies for what I termed “multimodal learning analytics:” a set of techniques that can be used to collect multiple sources of data in highfrequency (video, logs, audio, gestures, biosensors), synchronize and code the data, and examine learning in realistic, ecologically valid, social, mixed-media learning environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated, fine-grained data collection and analysis could help resolve this tension in two ways. First, they could give researchers tools to examine student-centered learning in unprecedented scale and detail. Second, these techniques could improve the scalability of these pedagogies since they make both assessment and formative feedback, which are more complex and laborious in such environments, feasible. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, in the well-established field of multimodal interaction, new data collection and sensing technologies are making it possible to capture massive amounts of data in all fields of human activity. These techniques include logs of computer activities, wearable cameras, wearable sensors, biosensors (e.g., skin conductivity, heartbeat, and EEG), gesture sensing, infrared imaging, and eye tracking. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;multimodal data collection and analysis techniques (“multimodal learning analytics”) could bring novel methods to understand what happens when students can generate unique solution paths to problems, interact with peers, and act in both the digital and the physical worlds. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rus et al. [20] makes extensive use of text analytics within a computer-based application for science learning, using expert-generated answers as a baseline. Beck and Sison [6] have demonstrated a method to assess reading proficiency combining speech recognition and probabilistic monitoring. D’Mello et al. [8] designed an application that could use spoken dialogue to recognize the states (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of boredom, frustration, flow, and confusion. Other researchers [1, 3] have been using machine learning in many contexts to measure students’ learning and affect, in particular, focusing on their trajectory within a learning environment [2]. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will describe examples of work in multimodal learning analytics, in three different areas: analysis of students learning to program, learning to build mechanical structures, and inventing machines. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STUDENTS’PROGRAMMING (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1 Programmingmodes (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We researched the creation of computer programs using 10,000 code snapshots from 74 students enrolled in an introductory undergraduate programming course, using two methods for the discovery of patterns in the data. The first method was a greatly enhanced version of the pattern detection used in the previous study, using machine-learning techniques such as cluster analysis and dynamic time warping. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All code updates were characterized based on their size and type, by identifying the number of lines and characters added, removed and modified between successive snapshots. This data was then used to construct a sequence of multidimensional vectors. This process was repeated for each assignment that the student completed. Using this sequence of vectors, the progress of each student was compared over the course of the class, by comparing their sequence of updates on a given assignment to their sequence of updates on the previous assignments. Students were then clustered based on the similarity of their update sequences. Six clusters emerged from the data. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time student ran, saved, or compiled their code, a snapshot of their code was stored. The analysis consisted in counting the amount and pattern of changes (additions/deletions) in the code, by calculating the number of characters and lines of code changed during the three-week assignment, as well as the frequency of compilation. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Copy and pasters:” characterized by a step-shaped growth curve, alternating plateaus with few code changes (looking for code / adapting the code), and rapid growth in code size (pasting the external code) – mostly observed in novice coders. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Self-sufficients:” characterized by a linear curve of steady increase in code size and almost no use of external code – mostly observed in more expert programmers. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2 Programmingstyles (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this work confirmed that indeed it was possible to cluster students in terms of robust behaviors that are dependent on expertise, and that those behaviors were correlated with their grades in the assignments and exams [19]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second study using text mining was designed to investigate students’ identity as engineers and scientists, and their level of identification with these professions [22]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TEXTMINING (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Constructioncompetence (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosodic analysis uses the pitch, intensity and duration of speech to infer intentionality and emotion. Linguistic analysis looks at several features such as pauses, filled pauses, and restarts, and can infer elements such as certainty. Sentiment analysis [17], using databases of terms such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and the Harvard Inquirer, infers sentiment from words or groups of words found in text. Content word analysis determines the knowledge contained in the text by using web-mined lexicons from chemistry, mathematics, computer science, material science and general science. Finally, dependency parsing and n-gram analysis can be used to inspect latent structures or meaning in the text by looking at group of words, sentences, and their relationship [7]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest here was to examine if students who did well in the robotics workshop would employ different vocabulary and linguistic structures. Indeed, the data showed that when students were describing a project they were proud of (as measured by the facilitators’ field notes), they would use “I” or “my,” in sentences such as, “my original design was&amp;hellip;” When the same student was describing a project that they were not proud of, they would instead use “it,” in sentences such as, “it’d be programmed to turn on&amp;hellip;” in place of “I programmed it to turn on.” (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counting word frequencies, we were able to determine that, for the group as a whole, students identified as high achievers in the workshop used “I” more than seven times more frequently than low-achievers. Again, here we can observe how even simple automated n-gram counting within transcripts can reveal meaningful elements of students’ affect. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OBJECT/BODYTRACKING (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest to this study is the presence of several features that accurately predicted expertise based on certainty. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These initial results confirm the work of Beck [6], which indicates that increasing expertise tends to increase student selfconfidence. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, novices exhibited a much higher frequency of disfluencies (average of 1.06 per normalized time interval) than experts (0.5), and experts had much longer and more frequent pauses. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, I presented a series of proof-of-concept studies for what I termed “multimodal learning analytics:” a set of techniques that can be used to collect multiple sources of data in highfrequency (video, logs, audio, gestures, biosensors), synchronize and code the data, and examine learning in realistic, ecologically valid, social, mixed-media learning environments. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article suggests criteria to evaluate the quality of dissertation literature reviews and reports a study that examined dis- sertations at three universities. Acquiring the skills and knowledge required to be education scholars, able to analyze and synthesize the research in a field of specialization, should be the focal, integrative activity of predissertation doctoral education. Such scholarship is a prerequisite for increased methodological sophistication and for im- proving the usefulness of education research. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Role and Purpose of the Literature Review in Education Research (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good” research is good because it advances our collective under- standing. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all heard the joke before—as we move through graduate school, we learn more and more about less and less until we know everything about nothing. It is expected that someone earning a doctorate has a thorough and sophisticated understanding of an area of research and scholarship. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shulman argues that generativity—along with discipline, publication, and peer review—is one of the hallmarks of schol- arship (1999, p. 162–163). He defines generativity as the ability to build on the scholarship and research of those who have come before us. Generativity grants our work integrity and sophistica- tion. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the messy, complicated nature of problems in education makes generativity in education research more difficult than in most other fields and disciplines (Berliner, 2002) (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reparing students to analyze and synthesize research in a field of specialization is crucial to understanding ed- ucational ideas. Such preparation is prerequisite to choosing a productive dissertation topic and appropriating fruitful methods of data collection and analysis. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education Research and Doctoral Preparation (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the foundation of any research project, the literature review should accomplish several important objectives. It sets the broad context of the study, clearly demarcates what is and what is not within the scope of the investigation, and justifies those deci- sions. It also situates an existing literature in a broader scholarly and historical context. It should not only report the claims made in the existing literature but also examine critically the research methods used to better understand whether the claims are war- ranted. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering the criteria and standards used to evaluate a dissertation, we need to keep in mind that most people with doctorates in education do not go on to pursue research careers. Most teach, administer, or lead (Passmore, 1980). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More- over, this type of review allows the author not only to summarize the existing literature but also to synthesize it in a way that permits a new perspective. Thus a good literature review is the basis of both theoretical and methodological sophistication, thereby improving the quality and usefulness of subsequent research. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uccessful doctoral candi- dates need to be “comprehensive and up to date in reviewing the literature” (Barry, 1997) and that their dissertations demonstrate this prowess (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it is apparent that for many, if not most, doctoral candi- dates and dissertation committees, the literature review is of sec- ondary importance. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduate education in the United States developed in a period when German universities were ascendant and when “America copied the German version of advanced studies &amp;hellip; unfortunately the period when the Berlin positivists were in the ascendancy” (Berelson, 1960, p. 12; see also Storr, 1969). As a result, the U.S. doctorate was designed to focus on research training, and the dissertation became a vehicle for demonstrating research prowess.2 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our secret is made pub- lic by editors and reviewers who openly lament the inadequacy of literature reviews in manuscripts submitted for journal publi- cation (Alton-Lee, 1998; Grant &amp;amp; Graue, 1999; LeCompte, Klingner, Campbell, &amp;amp; Menk, 2003). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schoenfeld (1999) identifies a number of difficulties and dilemmas facing doctoral education. Among these are specialization that leads to compartmentaliza- tion, theorizing that leads to superficiality, and simplistic ap- proaches to methodology that hinder a deep understanding of what it means to make and justify a claim about educational phe- nomena. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the basis of his experience coordinating and teaching in a doctoral program, Labaree (2003) outlined some of the general problems facing doctoral education. He framed the problems in terms of a clash between school and university cul- tures that occurs when we ask teachers to shift from a normative to an analytic way of thinking, from a personal to an intellectual relationship with educational phenomena, from a particular to a universal perspective, and from an experimental to a theoretical disposition. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite to the point. And special for education. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, with the very few ex- ceptions noted below, most graduate students receive little or no formal training in how to analyze and synthesize the research lit- erature in their field, and they are unlikely to find it elsewhere. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richardson (2003), who develops the concept of doctors of ed- ucation as stewards of both the field of study and the enterprise of education. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doctoral candidates would espouse such naïve concep- tions of literature reviewing and perceive it as relatively low in importance would seem to be a product of the culture of doctoral programs in education. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Literature Review: A Necessary Chore? (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ibrary skills (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bibliographic skills (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hese chapters typically indicate the importance of the literature review, albeit in vague terms, and briefly summarize techniques for searching electronic databases and methods for abstracting prior research. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but place a much greater emphasis on an understanding of methods of data collection and analysis. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creswell (1994) suggests that the literature review should meet three criteria: “to present results of similar studies, to relate the present study to the ongo- ing dialogue in the literature, and to provide a framework for comparing the results of a study with other studies” (p. 37). To accomplish these criteria Creswell (2002) recommends a five- step process: “identifying terms to typically use in your literature search; locating literature; reading and checking the relevance of the literature; organizing the literature you have selected; and writing a literature review” (p. 86). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Zaporozhetz and Labaree note that ed- ucation doctoral students tend to be mature, accomplished pro- fessionals who are committed to improving education practice. Yet these qualities make it more difficult for them to admit that they may lack library search and information synthesis skills and knowledge. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ature with more explanatory and predictive power than is offered by existing perspectives. Finally, it satisfies the formal criteria of a good theory. Standards such as consistency, parsimony, elegance, and fruitfulness characterize a good synthesis. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A product of this doctoral program culture is that the litera- ture review is not valued, and because it is not valued it is rarely an explicit part of doctoral curriculums. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Library instruction has tended to focus on the mechanics of database search strategies and on the varieties of in- formation available. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On en- countering an inadequate literature review, examiners would proceed to look at the methods of data collection, the analysis, and the conclusions much more carefully. In that way, Mullins and Kiley found that for examiners there was a tacit link between candidates’ knowledge of the field and their ability to do sub- stantive, well-justified research. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we need to under- stand that the ability to write a thorough, sophisticated literature review is a form of scholarship requiring a broad range of skills and knowledge—skills and knowledge that we ought to expect of anyone earning a doctorate. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Literature Review: Our Foundation and Inspiration (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an editorial in Review of Educational Research, LeCompte and colleagues (2003) wrote on the importance of convincing emerg- ing scholars that state-of-the-art literature reviews are legitimate and publishable scholarly documents. Too many new scholars believe that empiri- cal research is the only “real” research; they avoid the deep levels of investigation needed to create the kinds of manuscripts sought by RER. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hart contends (p. 27) that a disserta- tion literature review should clearly articulate what research needs be done in a field and why it is important, articulate the practical significance of the research, synthesize prior research to gain a new perspective on it, and critically analyze the research methods used.3 (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strike and Posner (1983, pp. 356–357) further suggest that a good synthetic review has three characteristics. First, it clarifies and perhaps resolves the problems within a field of study rather than glossing over those problems. Second, it results in a “pro- gressive problem shift” that yields a new perspective on the liter- (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hart clearly articulates that doctoral students must be successful scholars—able to critically synthesize ideas and meth- ods in their field—before they are to have any chance of being generative researchers (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with the most common con- ception, which seems to entail a mechanical process of summa- rizing a supposedly exhaustive collection of prior studies. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet library search skills are not enough. Too often, coverage is interpreted by doctoral students as exhaustive coverage of every- thing previously written about their topic (Bruce, 2001a). This naïve approach to searching and selecting prior research can make it very difficult for researchers to critically synthesize the literature in their field, (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standards and Criteria of a Literature Review (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce suggests that coverage should be looked at more broadly. He proposes eight criteria: topicality, comprehensiveness, breadth, exclusion, relevance, currency, avail- ability, and authority. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hart’s criteria were adapted and incorporated into our 12-item scoring rubric, which can be grouped into five categories (see Table 1). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first category, “Coverage,” consists of a single criterion that was not one of Hart’s. Criterion A assessed how well the au- thor of the dissertation justified criteria for inclusion and exclu- sion from review. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second category, “Synthesis,” consists of Criteria B through G and is designed to gauge how well the author summarized, analyzed, and synthesized the selected literature on a topic. The individual criteria ask how well the author (B) distinguished what has been done in the field from what needs to be done, &amp;copy; placed the topic or problem in the broader scholarly literature, (D) placed the research in the historical context of the field, (E) acquired and enhanced the subject vocabulary, (F) articulated important vari- ables and phenomena relevant to the topic, and (G) synthesized and gained a new perspective on the literature. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here are interesting differences among the ways that authors search the literature and make decisions about suitabil- ity and quality. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative novices to a topic of the review, mea- sured by the number of previous publications on the topic, tend to be very explicit about their search strategies and criteria and are more likely to use databases and indexes to identify and se- lect research to review. Relative experts, on the other hand, tend to not be as explicit about their search strategies and criteria and often rely on personal communications with leading researchers as their main means of identifying relevant research (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criteria H and I constitute the third category, “Methodology.” Criterion H measures how well the author identified the main methodologies and research techniques that have been used in the field, and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At minimum, an author should recognize how previous researchers’ methodological choices affected the research findings. Any sophisticated review of literature should also con- sider the research methods used in that literature and consider the strengths and weaknesses of those research methods (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literature Review Analysis Findings (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After developing our rubric, we initially examined 30 dissertations awarded in the year 2000 from three state-funded colleges of ed- ucation in the United States; we selected 12 of those dissertations for full analysis. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth category, “Significance,” includes Criteria J and K, which measure how well the dissertation rationalized the practi- cal (J) and scholarly (K) significance of the research problem. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analy- sis of dissertation literature reviews supports Schoenfeld’s (1999) contention that doctoral students may not be learning what it means to make and justify educational claims.5 (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final category, “Rhetoric,” also consists of a single item, Criterion L, which measures whether the literature review was written with a coherent, clear structure that supported the re- view. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such lack of sophistication does not bode well for the students’ ability to stay abreast of research in their field as teachers, administrators or leaders—let alone to lead productive research careers after re- ceiving their doctorates. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, Granello (2001) has argued that focusing on the formal aspects of writing is a means of increasing students’ cog- nitive complexity, moving students from lower to higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy of the cognitive domain (see also Libutti &amp;amp; Kopala, 1995). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These high-quality reviews lead us to believe that our cri- teria and standards are not unreasonable. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these twelve criteria and associated stan- dards set ambitious expectations for doctoral dissertation liter- ature reviews. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paltridge (2002) differentiates among four general dissertation formats, each of which is seen among education dissertations. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional simple dissertation presents a single study in five chapters (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Paltridge (2002) calls the traditional complex format pre- sents several related studies, each presenting its own introduction, methods, results, and conclusions. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic-based dissertation is also often used in education, especially for theoretical, philosophical, humanities-based, and qualitative dissertations (Paltridge, 2002). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refining Our Conception of Literature Reviewing (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the compilation of research articles format for disserta- tions, advocated in these pages by Duke and Beck (1999), pre- sents a number of discrete articles often written in the format of journal articles, framed with introductory and concluding sec- tions. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common concerns raised about our research is whether the criteria and standards that we have developed should apply to the two types of doctoral degrees in education and to various dissertation formats. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;indeed, it is quite unclear to us what, exactly, earning a doctorate might signify if one does not know the literature in one’s field. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second concern often raised is whether our criteria ought to apply to the various formats of dissertations. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever format the author chooses, a thorough, sophisticated review ought to be influential and ev- ident in the entire dissertation. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is productive insight that distinguishes a synthetic review, in Lather’s (1999) sense, from the plodding research summaries that characterize most dissertations. Productive insight can never be routine. But we contend that requiring doctoral candidates to engage in substantive, thorough, sophisticated literature reviews creates and fosters conditions that will greatly increase the likeli- hood of their developing productive insight. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking Forward (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctoral students must be scholars before they are researchers. First and foremost, a dissertation should demonstrate a thorough and sophisticated grasp of one’s field of study; secondarily and antecedently, it should demonstrate the ability to do research that advances the collective understanding of important educa- tion issues. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bargar and Duncan (1986) write, a “thor- ough understanding and sincere commitment to problems of im- portance can and very often do lead to pedestrian, unimaginative solutions” (p. 35). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the most obvious means of improving the situation— adding a class on literature reviewing to doctoral programs—is the least likely to be effective. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, to review the literature in the way that we have sug- gested here is a very complex task that requires the integration and application of a variety of skills and knowledge that few in- dividual faculty members have mastered. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to stress that a good literature review is necessary but not sufficient for good research. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this approach to literature reviewing requires ad- vanced bibliographic methods for searching and locating re- search from a variety of sources (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also requires diverse skills on the part of doctoral faculty. These include a substantive under- standing of the topic being reviewed, the skills and knowledge required to critically evaluate and synthesize concepts, advanced understanding of writing and rhetoric, and the sophisticated un- derstanding of research methodology that is required to critically evaluate methods used in prior studies and suggest means of overcoming prior methodological limitations. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, literature reviewing should be a central focus of predissertation coursework, inte- grated throughout the program. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our concern is that by focusing on methodological issues, the education research community is addressing the symptom rather than the cause. That is, researchers must understand prior research in their field, and its strengths and weaknesses, before they can be expected to choose appropriate methods of data collection and data analysis. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only recently have libraries redefined library instruction, with its traditional emphasis on mechanical searching skills, to include information literacy, which employs a more conceptual approach to information use. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, empiricism and methodological issues have been ascendant at the expense of scholarship, generativity, and theory building. Theorizing is fundamental to research and scholarship. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the idea a step further, Isbell and Broaddus (1995) discuss the possibility of integrating writing instruction into the process. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctoral faculty expect doctoral students to possess not just bibliographic skills but also advanced skills in the mechanics of writing and the art of rhetoric. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great intro to two-mode SNA. Requires understanding of SNA basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In social network analysis, 2-mode data refers to data recording ties between two sets of entities. In this con- text, the term “mode” refers to a class of entities – typically called actors, nodes or vertices – whose members have so- cial ties with other members (in the 1-mode case) or with members of another class (in the 2-mode case). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kinds of data are often referred to as affilia- tions. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best known example of 2-mode network anal- ysis is contained in the study of class and race by Davis, Gardner and Gardner (henceforth DGG) published in the 1941 book Deep South [6]. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, what constitutes different modes is up to the researcher. If we collect romantic ties among a group of heterosexual people of both genders, we could construct a 2-mode men-by-women matrix X in which x ij D 1if a romantic tie was observed between man i and woman j, and x ij D 0 otherwise. Or, one could construct a larger 1-mode person-by-person matrix B also consisting of 1s and 0s in which it just happens that 1s only occur in cells where the row and column correspond to persons of different gender. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An edge is simply an unordered pair of nodes ( u, v). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bipartite graph is a graph in which we can partition all nodes into two sets, V 1 and V 2,suchthatalledgesin- clude a member of V 1 and a member of V 2.Thenumberof nodes in each vertex set is denoted n 1 and n 2, respectively. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-Mode Data in SocialNetwork Analysis (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2-mode data are common in social network contexts as well. Typical examples include, actor-by-event attendance (as in the DGG data), actor by group mem- bership (such as managers sitting on corporate boards), and actor by trait possession (such as adjective checklist data), and actor by object possession (such as material style of life scales in which inventories are made of household possessions). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unimodal Approaches to Two-Mode Data (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to handling 2-mode data in social network analysis is to convert the data to 1-mode data. This is es- pecially appropriate when the analytical interest focuses primarily on just one of the modes. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases when 2-mode data are collected, the analytical interest is focused on one mode or the other. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it can also occur that neither mode domi- nates our analytical focus and the primary interest is in the correspondence of one mode to the other. For example, a university might ask its faculty which courses they prefer to teach. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unimodal Visualization of Two-Mode Data (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, one can use a standard graph layout al- gorithm (GLA) to draw the graph induced by dichotomiz- ing the Jaccard similarity matrix (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unimodal Analysis of Two-Mode Data (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, analysis of 2-mode data transformed into val- ued 1-mode networks proceeds like any other valued net- work. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however,a few consequences that stem from the 2-mode origin of the data. By their very nature, many commonly used measures of similarity and dissimilarity satisfy triangle inequality laws. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bimodal Visualization of Two-Mode Data (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the standard ways to visualize networks, such as MDS and GLAs, apply to bipartite graphs. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bimodal Approaches to Two-Mode Data (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, all ties are between vertex sets and none are within-group. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The matrix representation of such a graph can be a rectangular incidence matrix X (as in Fig. 1) or a square bipartite adjacency matrix B with n D n 1 C n 2 rows representing both modes, and an equal number of columns, also representing both modes. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For small datasets, this bimodal visualization is often extremely effective for transmitting a holistic understand- ing of the whole dataset. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to treat the bipartite graphs as or- dinary graphs and apply all the standard algorithms and techniques of social network analysis. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works for a small class of methods, but by no means all. For example, calculating transitivity fails be- cause transitive triples are impossible in bipartite graphs (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bimodal Analysis of Two-Mode Data (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a bimodal perspective, one approach to analyzing 2-mode data is to develop entirely new metrics and algo- rithms designed specifically for 2-mode data. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a compromise approach is to use the standard metrics and algorithms that apply to general graphs, and then either adjust the outputs via normalization or adjust the baseline expectations for the results &lt;a href=&#34;p. 7&#34;&gt;5,9 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, taking account of the fact that the observed lack ties between certain nodes (namely, those belonging to different modes) was by de- sign – similar to the concept of structural zeros in log-lin- ear modeling. To date, few techniques of this kind have been developed, the exception being the area of 2-mode centrality measures, which has received significant atten- tion (e. g., [2]). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bimodal Approaches to Graph Cohesion The simplest and most common measure of network cohesion is den- sity – the number of edges divided by the number of pairs of nodes (using ordered pairs in the case of directed graphs and unordered pairs in the case of undirected graphs). In bipartite graphs, of course, only edges between vertex sets are possible. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bimodal Approaches to Centrality (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Degree centrality, d i, is defined as the number of ties incident upon node i. Degree centrality is typically nor- malized by dividing by the maximum number of ties pos- sible,whichinagraphofn nodes is n 1. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in any (non-trivial) bipartite graph, no node can be connected to all others, since this would mean within- mode ties. Instead, for a node in V 1, the maximum num- ber of ties it could have is n 2,whereasforanodeinV 2,the maximum number of ties is n 1. Hence a natural adjust- ment is to provide two separate normalization formulas as follows: (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For measures of cohesion that are not expressed as fractions of maximum possible values, such as average geodesic path length, the need to renormalize is not as great, since the raw values are directly interpretable. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closeness centrality is ordinarily defined as the sum of geodesic distances from a node to all others (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the bipartite case, the maximum number of nodes that a node can be distance 1 from is the number of nodes in the other class. For other nodes in its own class, the clos- est it can be is two links away. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohesive Subgroups Detecting cohesive subgroups is somewhat more difficult in bipartite graphs than in ordi- nary graphs. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in bipartite graphs, cliques are impossible, since in any connected triple, two nodes must be non-adjacent. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Betweenness centrality refers to the sum of shares of short- est paths that pass through a given node. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, other classical notions of cohesive sub- groups make more sense for bipartite graphs. In particular, relaxations of the clique concept based on distance, such as n-cliques, n-clans and n-clubs have good interpreta- tions in bipartite graphs and work well in practice. In fact, 2-cliques defined on the bipartite graph have the property of bipartite completeness, meaning that, within the bipar- tite subgraph induced by the 2-clique, every node of one mode has a tie with every node of the other mode, which is to say that all possible ties are present. In this sense, for bipartite graphs, 2-cliques capture the underlying idea of a clique better than cliques do. This notion has been for- malized in the definition of a biclique,whichisdefined as a maximal complete bipartite subgraph. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This maximum is appropriate for bipar- tite graphs only when one mode has just one node; oth- erwise we must take account of the sizes of each vertex set. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are structural equivalence and regular equivalence. Generalizations to 2-mode (and higher) data were developed by Borgatti [3] and Borgatti and Everett [4] and Everett and Borgatti [7]. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structural Equivalence In the best definition of structural equivalence [8], two nodes u and v are said to be struc- turally equivalent if there exists a graph automorphism that would be an identity except that u andv are mapped to each other. In other words, given a diagram of the graph, you could swap nodes u and v (and no other nodes) with- out changing the structure of the network one iota. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of bicliques as 2-mode analogues of cliques suggests the possibility of creating 2-mode analogues for other cohesive subgroup concepts that we previously dis- missed as unusable in the 2-mode context. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, one approach to identifying structurally equivalent nodes is to compute a similarity measure among rows and columns of the ad- jacency matrix defining the graph. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach requires no modification for the bi- partite case. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bimodal Approaches to Positions and Roles (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach to structural equivalence is known as blockmodeling. Instead of (or as a result of) measur- ing the extent of structural equivalence between nodes, we partition the nodes into classes such that nodes in the same class are structurally equivalent (or nearly so). Given such a partition of nodes, we can reorder and partition the corresponding rows and columns of the adjacency ma- trix. This in turn induces to partition of matrix cells into matrix blocks. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more elegant (and computationally efficient) ap- proach is to work from the 2-mode incidence matrix X. In this case, we redefine a blockmodel to refer to a coordi- nated pair of partitions, one for the rows and one for the columns. We then redefine structural equivalence as fol- lows. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to the extent that they have ties (lack of ties) to corre- sponding others who are themselves regularly equivalent to each other. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In empirical work, of course, we do not expect to ob- tain perfect 1-blocks and 0-blocks. Instead we seek parti- tions that minimize the number of errors (where we de- fine an error as either a 1 inside a 0-block or a 0 inside a1-block). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular Equivalence Two nodes are said to be regularly equivalent (i. e., play the same structural role) to each other (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion In this chapter we have considered methods of visualizing and analyzing 2-mode network data. An examination of the chapter suggests that four strategies are employed for handling 2-mode data. First, there is converting the data into two separate 1-mode datasets,and analyzing each sep- arately. Second, there is using existing 1-mode methods on a bipartite representation of the 2-mode data, and es- sentially ignoring its special features. Third, there is using 1-mode methods but either adjusting the interpretation or applying some kind of normalization to adjust the results. Finally, there is developing new methods designed specifi- cally for the 2-mode case. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it would be a mistake to think of 2-mode data as an advance over 1-mode data, it is important to note that there are many cases were extending network analysis methodology to more than 2 modes is desirable. For exam- ple, we might analyze membership in organizations over time, yielding a 3-way, 3-mode data matrix of relations that is person by organization by period. Similarly, we might be interested in modeling the intellectual landscape of an academic field, representing publications as k-mode bundles of authors, journals, years, institutional affiliations and topics. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;both examples are fascinating. So excited. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Buckingham2010-mc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buckingham, D. (2010). Defining digital literacy. In Medienbildung in neuen Kulturr{ä}umen (pp. 59–71). Springer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter criticizes traditional emphasis on &lt;em&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt; aspects of digital literacy and highlights four broad conceptual aspects that are generally regarded as essential components of media literacy (see Buckingham, 2003): representation, language, production, and audience. The author treats media not simply as tools but &lt;em&gt;cultural forms&lt;/em&gt; and invite educators to recognize cultural practices related to new media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the use of the term “literacy” implies a broader form of edu- cation about media that is not restricted to mechanical skills or narrow forms of functional competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of media education, the aim is not primarily to develop technical skills, or to promote “self-expression”, but to encourage a more systematic understanding of how the media work and hence to promote more reflective ways of using them. In this latter respect, media education directly challenges the instrumental use of media production as a transparent or neutral “teaching aid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Th ese media cannot be adequately understood if we persist in regarding them simply as a matter of machines and techniques, or as “hardware” and “software.” Th e internet, computer games, digital video, mobile phones and other contemporary technologies provide new ways of me- diating and representing the world and of communicating. (p. 76)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Literacies (p. 76)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literacy” comes to be used merely as a vague synonym for “competence,” or even “skill.” (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “literacy” clearly carries a degree of social status; and to use it in connection with other, lower status forms such as television, or in relation to newer media, is thus to make an implicit claim for the latter’s validity as objects of study. (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the use of the term “literacy” implies a broader form of edu- cation about media that is not restricted to mechanical skills or narrow forms of functional competence. (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards Digital Literacy (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contemporary usage, digital (or computer) literacy often appears to amount to a minimal set of skills that will enable the user to operate eff ectively with soft- ware tools or in performing basic information retrieval tasks. Th is is essentially a functional defi nition: it specifi es the basic skills that are required to undertake particular operations, but it does not go very far beyond this. (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the British government has attempted to defi ne and measure the ICT skills of the population alongside traditional literacy and numeracy as part of its Skills for Life survey (Williams et al., 2003). Th is survey defines these skills at two levels. Level 1 includes an understanding of common ICT terminology; the ability to use basic features of software tools such as word- processors and spreadsheets; and the ability to save data, copy and paste, man- age fi les, and standardize formats within documents. Level 2 includes the use of search engines and databases, and the ability to make more advanced use of software tools. (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;both levels are functional (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, most discussions of digital literacy remain primarily preoccupied with information—and therefore tend to neglect some of the broader cultural uses of the internet (not least by young people). (p. 79)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it needs to begin with some of the “basics. (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to stop there is to confi ne digital literacy to a form of instrumental or functional literacy. Th e skills that children need in relation to digital media are not confi ned to those of information retrieval. As with print, they also need to be able to evaluate and use information critically if they are to transform it into knowledge. Th is means asking questions about the sources of that information, the interests of its producers, and the ways in which it represents the world; and understanding how these technological developments are related to broader social, political and economic forces. (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media Literacy Goes Online (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Th is more critical notion of literacy (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Th ere are four broad conceptual aspects that are generally regarded as essential components of media literacy (see Buckingham, 2003). (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representation (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all media, digital media represent the world, rather than simply refl ect it. Th ey off er particular interpretations and selections of reality, which inevi- tably embody implicit values and ideologies. (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;addressing questions about authority, reliability and bias, and it also necessarily invokes broader questions about whose voices are heard and whose viewpoints are represented and whose are not. (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a systematic awareness of how digital media are constructed and of the unique “rhetorics” of interactive communication: in the case of the web, for example, this would include understanding how sites are designed and structured, and the rhetorical functions of links between sites (cf. Burbules &amp;amp; Callister, 2000, pp. 85–90). (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;understanding who is communicating to whom and why. (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a “safety” aspect to this (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audience (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, literacy also involves an awareness of one’s own position as an audi- ence (reader or user). (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fails to do justice to the interactivity of the internet—although substitute terms are no more satisfactor (p. 82)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case 1: Web Literacy (p. 82)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case 2: Game Literacy (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a growing interest in using computer games in education, but here again, most proposals implicitly conceive of games as a neutral “teaching aid.” In line with Eco’s argu- ment about television, I would argue that we also need to be teaching young people about games as a cultural form—and that this is a necessary prerequisite for using games in order to teach other curriculum areas. (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Writing” Digital Media (p. 87)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media literacy involves “writing” the media as well as “reading” them, and here, again, digital technology presents some important new challenges and possibilities. (p. 87)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, new media are a key aspect of the much more participatory media culture that is now emerging—in the form of blogging, social networking, game-making, small-scale video pro- duction, podcasting, social software, and so on ( Jenkins, 2006). (p. 87)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, media educ ation is generally characterized by an explicit focus on popular culture—or at least on engaging with students’ everyday experiences of digital media rather than attempting to impose an alien “artistic” or “educational” practice. (p. 88)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there is the element of theoretical reflection—the dynamic relationship between making and critical understanding that is crucial to the development of “critical literacy.” In the context of media education, the aim is not primarily to develop technical skills, or to promote “self-expression”, but to encourage a more systematic understanding of how the media work and hence to promote more reflective ways of using them. In this latter respect, media education directly challenges the instrumental use of media production as a transparent or neutral “teaching aid.” (p. 88)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than simply adding media or digital literacy to the curriculum menu or hiving off information and communication technology into a separate school subject, we need a much broader reconceptualization of what we mean by literacy in a world that is increasingly dominated by electronic media. (p. 90)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @scardamalia2004&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scardamalia, M. (2004). CSILE/Knowledge Forum. In A. Kovalchick &amp;amp; K. Dawson (Eds.), Education and technology: An encyclopedia (pp. 183–192). Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;::The origins of CSILE (Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments) are in research
on knowledge building, on the nature of expertise, and on the socio-cultural dynamics of
innovation. CSILE was designed to (a) make advanced knowledge processes accessible to all
participants, including children, (b) foster the creation and continual improvement of public
artifacts or community knowledge (Scardamalia, 2002), and ( c ) provide a community space for
carrying out this knowledge building work collaboratives. ::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE was first prototyped in a
university course in 1983. By 1986 a fully-functioning networked version was in daily use in an
elementary school. In 1995 it was reengineered, with its affordances for knowledge building
substantially enhanced, and published as Knowledge Forum® (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.knowledgeforum.com&#34;&gt;http://www.knowledgeforum.com&lt;/a&gt;)
by Learning in Motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE
was not management, planning, or productivity software retooled for children; it was
technology specifically designed to support knowledge creation. It was not a collection of tools;
::it was an environment to support the kinds of inquiry, information search, and creative work
with ideas that go on in knowledge-building organizations of all kinds. ::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Forum is the only product continuously improved over the years based on research
results arising from active and diverse user communities and reflecting knowledge building
theory, principles, and practices. ::Knowledge Forum development is not driven by technology,
but uses advances in technology to continually enhance and unfold the knowledge building
agenda.::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;knowledge-building-affordances&#34;&gt;Knowledge Building Affordances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;::The heart of CSILE/Knowledge Forum is a multimedia community knowledge space. In the
form of notes, participants contribute theories, working models, plans, evidence, reference
material, and so forth to this shared space. The software provides knowledge building supports
both in the creation of these notes and in the ways they are displayed, linked, and made objects
of further work.:: Revisions, elaborations, and reorganizations over time provide a record of
group advances, like the accumulation of research advances in a scholarly discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;multiple-perspectives-multiple-literacies-and-teamwork&#34;&gt;Multiple Perspectives, Multiple Literacies, and Teamwork&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Notes and views support teamwork and collaborative design. Notes are multimedia objects
that can be co-authored. View backgrounds are not simply white backdrops or static bulletin
boards (although they can be used that way); they are collaborative design environments with a
built in graphics program that makes it easy for users to design their own backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Views provide different perspectives on information. As the work of the biologist presented
in the last pane of Figure 1 suggests, this networked technology is used to expand perspectives
rather than solidify roles in which students ask questions and experts answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Multimedia and other supports provide a way in for all participants to a common discourse.
Notes and views support a range of multimedia objects, from text to video. As an example,
some of these Grade 1 students were not writers at the beginning of the year but did represent
their ideas graphically. Easy assignment of keywords (touching a word in a note with a movable
key icon is all it takes) made it possible for these young students to keyword their notes. These
notes were then available, via keyword searches, for incorporation into new conceptual views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Notes and views can be individually or group authored. They can also be entered into private
or public spaces; the default option is that they are contributed to a public forum. Accordingly,
the environment encourages openness in knowledge work while enhancing both individual and
group processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Emergent ideas and goals are supported. Knowledge Forum represents an open environment,
without predetermined boundaries or structures around ideas or activities. Through collective
responsibility for public knowledge spaces, with input from varied sources of expertise, the
environment favors the emergence of big ideas and deep principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;creating-connections-and-public-knowledge&#34;&gt;Creating Connections and Public Knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Flexible build-ons. The first five panes show the varied forms that a build-on structure can
take. The note complex has been rearranged a number of times to give greater meaning to the
concepts of frequency and amplitude. This flexibility can be contrasted with the downward
branching of these same notes in threaded discourse, as illustrated in the last pane of this figure.
Linear discourse forms and isolated ‘conferences’ entrap ideas. Idea connectedness is further facilitated through the following means (see Figures 3-6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Annotation, citation, and reference links. Annotations and reference links can be added to
any note. References include pointers back to source notes, so ideas can be viewed in both
original and new contexts. Links to views and subviews can be embedded within either notes
or views. Deep embedding of ideas facilitates deep processing of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Interconnected views. Views can be interlinked: views reference other views, and different
levels of access to views can be used to indicate the centrality or distance of particular views to
the current work of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Multi-faceted indices. Author-assigned indices (keywords, scaffolds, problem fields, titles)
and automatically assigned indices (author, date, semantic field) make notes available through
a variety of search parameters; a note sorter allows the notes resulting from a search to be
sorted for viewing or transported into another view (also see Figure 1). Citation, commentary,
and notification enhance engagement through drawing all relevant authors back into the
discourses that involve their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;advanced-knowledge-processes&#34;&gt;Advanced Knowledge Processes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaffolding Knowledge Processes. Scaffold supports are Knowledge Forum’s most imitated
feature. They were originally designed to provide procedural facilitation (Scardamalia and
Bereiter, 1983) for fostering expertise in writing, and were titled ‘thinking types.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Scaffolds give ideas defined roles in such processes as theory refinement (e.g., This theory
cannot explain&amp;hellip;) and constructive criticism. The opportunistic rather than mandated use of
scaffold supports helps students embed these forms of discourse in their everyday work with
ideas. As Pontecorvo (1993) states “forms of discourse become forms of thinking (p 191).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The supports contained within any particular scaffold can be used opportunistically and
flexibly in any order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Scaffolds are customizable. They can be easily added or modified to support the discourse
needs of a particular community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference and Contribute. Knowledge Forum replaces the common ‘say it in your own words’
norm with the more mature ‘contribute-and-reference’ norm. As illustrated in the italicized text
in Figure 3, cited material is automatically quoted (made visually distinct), with automatic links
back to original sources, and automatic compilation of a bibliography. Users are especially
drawn to this feature, because they see their work referenced rather than copied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems of understanding. A problem field at the header of the note encourages a shift from
topicto problem-based inquiry. Knowledge Forum’s ‘problem space’ encourages the
identification of problems of understanding to guide inquiry. ‘Problem’ searches produce an
overview of the problems that others are working on, so it is easy to contribute to those problem
spaces or start a new field of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;rise-above-and-improvable-ideas&#34;&gt;Rise-Above and Improvable Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rise-above” notes play a pivotal role in idea improvement. The idea, based on the
philosophical concept of dialectic, is that the most constructive way of dealing with divergent or
opposing ideas is not to decide on a winner or a compromise position but rather to create a new
idea that preserves the value of the competing ideas while “rising above” their incompatibilities.
In the simplest cases a rise-above may be simply a summary or distillation; in the most
compelling cases, the rise-above presents a new idea that all the participants can recognize as
an advance over their previous ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endless improvability of ideas is further supported by the following:
• Ability to create increasingly high-order conceptual frameworks. It is always possible to
reformulate problems at more complex levels, create a rise-above note that encompasses
previous rise-above notes, or to create a more inclusive view-of-views.
• Review and Revision. Notes and views can be revised at any time, unlike most discussion
environments that disallow changes after a note is posted.
• Published&amp;rsquo; notes and views. Processes of peer review and new forms of publication engage
students in group editorial processes. Published works appear in a different visual form and
searches can be restricted to the published layer of a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;individual-and-group-portfolios-evolution-of-ideas&#34;&gt;Individual and Group Portfolios; Evolution of Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ideas-and-artifacts-as-objects-of-discourse&#34;&gt;Ideas and Artifacts as Objects of Discourse&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;embedded-and-transformative-assessment&#34;&gt;Embedded and transformative assessment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge builders monitor their work, and engage in self-assessment rather than being totally
dependent on external evaluations.
Research tools work in the background of Knowledge Forum to automatically record
activity patterns such as reading, building-on, referencing, and creating views. Results from
these analytic tools can then be fed back into the work as it proceeds, rather than waiting until
the end of a unit of work to provide feedback, when it is too late to make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly social network analysis can be applied to the study of covert networks (Sparrow, 1991). Many are stepping forward suggesting that to understand these networks we just need to “connect the dots” and then isolate the “key actors who are often defined in terms of their “centrality” in the network. To an extent, this is right. However, it belies the difficulty of “connecting the dots” in terms of mining vast quantities of information, pattern matching on agent characteristics for people who go under multiple aliases, and still ending up with information the may be intentionally misleading, inaccurate, out-of-date, and incomplete. Further, this belies the difficulty in “knowing” who is the most central when you have at best only a sample of the network. Finally, and critically, this approach does not contend with the most pressing problem – the underlying network is dynamic. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limitations to Traditional SNA (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, social network analysis (SNA) has focused on small, bounded networks, with 2-3 types of links (such as friendship and advice) among one type of node (such as people), at one point in time, with close to perfect information. To be sure there are a few studies that have considered extremely large networks, or two types of nodes (people and events), or unbounded networks (such as inter-organizational response teams); however, these are the exception not the norm. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Network Analysis (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently there have been a number of advances that extend SNA to the realm of dynamic analysis and multi-color networks. There are three key advances: 1) the meta-matrix, 2) treating ties as probabilistic, and 3) combining social networks with cognitive science and multi-agent systems. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta-Matrix: Carley (2002) combined knowledge management, operations research and social networks techniques together to create the notion of the meta-matrix – a multi-color, multiplex representation of the entities and the connections among them. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purpose, the entities of interest are people, knowledge/resources, events/tasks and organizations – see table 1. This defines a set of 10 inter-linked networks such that changes in one network cascade into changes in the others; relationships in one network imply relationships in another. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the basis of this meta-matrix new metrics can be developed that better capture the overall importance of an individual, task, or resource in the group. An example of such a metric is cognitive load – the effort an individual has to employ to hold his role in the terrorist group and it takes in to account, who he interacts with, which events he has been at, which organizations he is a member of, the coordination costs of working with others in the same organization or at the same event or in learning from an earlier event or training for an upcoming event. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key difficulty from a growth of science perspective, is that as we move from SNA to DNA the number, type, complexity, and value of measures changes. A core issue for DNA is what are the appropriate metrics for describing and contrasting dynamic networks. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, cognitive load, which measures the cognitive effort and individual has to do at one point in time has been shown to be a valuable predictor of emergent leadership (Carley and Ren, 2001). Cognitive load is a complex measure that takes into account the number of others, resources, tasks the agent needs to manage and the communication needed to engage in such activity. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that these are a candidate set that have value and that as a field we need to develop a small set of metrics that can be applied to networks, regardless of size, to characterize the dynamics. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1. Meta-Matrix (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probabilistic Ties: The ties in the meta-matrix are probabilistic. Various factors affect the probability, including the observer’s certainty in the tie and the likelihood that the tie is manifest at that time. Bayesian updating techniques (Dombroski and Carley, 2002), cognitive inferencing techniques, and models of social and cognitive change processes (Carley, 2002; Carley, Lee and Krackhardt, 2001) can be used to estimate the probability and how it changes over time. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-Agent Network Models: A major problem with traditional SNA is that the people in the networks are not treated as active adaptive agents capable of taking action, learning, and altering their networks. There are several basic, well known, social and cognitive processes that influence who is likely to interact with whom: relative similarity, relative expertise, and coworker. Carley uses multi-agent technology in which the agents use these mechanisms, learn, take part in events, do tasks to model organizational and social change. The dynamic social network emerges from these actions. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Network Theory (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To move beyond representation and method, we need to ask, “How do networks change?” What are the basic processes? From the meta-matrix perspective, the processes are easy – things that lead to the adding and dropping of nodes and/or relations – see table 2. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are a set of processes that lead to the addition and removal of relations. Basic processes are cognitive, social and political in nature. Cognitive processes have to do with learning and forgetting, the changes that occur in ties due to changes in what individuals know. Social changes occur when one agent or organization dictates a change in ties, such as when a manager re-assigns individuals to tasks. Finally, political changes are due to legislation that effect organizations and the over-arching goals. To illustrate what is meant, a limited number of such processes are described in Table 3. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DyNet (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the DyNet project is to develop the equivalent of a flight simulator for reasoning about dynamic networked organizations. Through a unique blending of computer science, social networks and organization theory we are creating a new class of tools for managing organizational dynamics. The core tool is DyNet – a reasoning support tool for reasoning under varying levels of uncertainty about dynamic networked and cellular organizations, their vulnerabilities, and their ability to reconstitute themselves. Using DyNet the analyst would be able to see how the networked organization was likely to evolve if left alone, how its performance could be affected by various information warfare and isolation strategies, and how robust these strategies are in the face of varying levels of information assurance. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DyNet tool is a step toward understanding how networks will evolve, change, adapt and how they can be destabilized. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DyNet, which is a computer model of dynamic networks, can also be thought of as the embodiment of a theory of dynamic networks. The focus of this theory is on the cognitive, and to a lesser extent, social processes by which the networks in the meta-matrix evolve. The basic cognitive forces for change in DyNet are learning, forgetting, goal-setting, and motivation for interaction. The basic social forces for change are recruitment, isolation, and to a limited extent the initiation of rumors and training. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic motivations for interaction are relative similarity, relative expertise or some combination of the two. Relative similarity is based on the fundamental finding of homophilly, the tendency of interacting partners to be similar. Arguments surrounding this fundamental process include the need for communicative ease, comfort, access, and training. Relative expertise is based on the fundamental finding that when in doubt people will turn they view as experts for information. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the attrition strategies are removal of the most “central” individual, removal of the individual with the highest cognitive load, and removal of individual’s at random. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agents can be distinguished based on fixed characteristics such as race, family and gender, and on knowledge (or training). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the basic networks can be extracted continually in order to see the system evolve. Among the networks that can be extracted are the knowledge network, the overall social network, the emotive or “friendship” networks, and the acquisition or “advice” network. The network evolutionary strategies include learning (during interaction), forgetting, personnel attrition, misinformation, and changing task demands. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Structure of the Network Matters (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first finding, and it is quite robust, is that the structure of the network matters. That is, random networks in which the relations are distributed in an independent and identical fashion, hierarchies, and cellular networks all evolve quite differently, require different strategies to destabilize, have different abilities to diffuse information, and exhibit different performance for the same task. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second key finding is that networks are generally able to heal themselves. That is isolation of a node that links disparate groups together typically does not leave those groups disconnected. Rather the basic social and cognitive processes outlined lead individuals to seek alternative contact points to interact with. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Information is Not Necessary (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice, that in traditional SNA, typically we have close to full information. For covert networks we do not. Information may be missing because we don’t know some of the nodes – the people involved, or because we don’t know some of the relations. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly having close to perfect or perfect knowledge means that more effective isolation strategies are found. Note, however, that any isolation is better than none, assuming our goal is to degrade the performance and that we don’t need perfect information to be quite effective. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when we don’t really know the underlying social and knowledge network we may overestimate the primacy of a person, who although not the key in terms of degree centrality, is more central in terms of cognitive load. Thus, in effect, less knowledge makes both the centrality and the cognitive load strategies more similar resulting in on average lower performance due to the fact that cellular networks are more devastated by the extraction of such emergent leaders, at least in the short run. Further, reduced information about relations makes all isolation strategies more mixed thus inhibiting the ability of the opponent to engage in meta-learning. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about networks from a dynamic perspective is absolutely essential to understanding the modern world. An approach toward dynamic networks has been outlined. There are several distinctive hallmarks to this approach. First, in contrast to other multi-agent work, the agents we describe are in actual social networks. Here, the networks and the agents co-evolve. Secondly, the web of affiliations connects not just agents, but agents and other entities such as knowledge, tasks and organizations. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to traditional SNA, DNA considers the role of the agent in terms of processes and not just position. That is, the agents can do things – communicate, store information, learn. Further, the networks are dynamic and changing even as the agents change. The links are probabilistic, the networks multi-colored and multi-plex to the extent that the set of networks combine in to one complex system where changes in one sub-network inform and constrain changes in the others, often leading to error cascades. Finally, DNA explores the sensitivity of the measures and the impacts to error. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since all human action is cognitively mediated – it is unlikely that such mechanisms will not be derivable, at a basic level from what the physical and physiological constraints, what the agent knows, the basic learning and information processing mechanisms, and the way in which groups, organizations and institutions store such information. To create a truly dynamic network theory we need to create the equivalent of a quantum dynamics for the socio-cognitive world, where the fundamental entities, the people, unlike atoms, have the ability to learn. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid ethnographic assessment is used when there is a need to quickly create a socio-cultural profile of a group or region. While there are many forms such an assessment can take, we view it as providing insight into who are the key actors, what are the key issues, sentiments, resources, activities and locations, how have these changed in recent times, and what roles do the various actors play. We propose a mixed initiative rapid ethnographic approach that supports socio-cultural assess- ment through a network analysis lens. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We refer to this as the data-to-model (D2M) process. In D2M, semi-automated computer-based text-mining and machine learning techniques are used to extract networks linking people, groups, issues, sentiments, resources, activities and locations from vast quantities of texts. Human-in-the-loop procedures are then used to tune and correct the extracted data and refine the compu- tational extraction. Computational post-processing is then used to refine the extracted data and augment it with other information, such as the latitude and longitude of particular cities. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in many environments, there is a need to address these questions remotely; i.e., without actually going to the region of concern or meeting with the members of the group. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid ethnographic assessment is an approach for rapidly characterizing the socio- cultural landscape (Beebe 1995). Rapid ethnographic assessment provides insight into the socio-cultural nature of a region by identifying the current key actors, issues, sentiments, resources, activities and locations, and any recent changes. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional ethnography requires massive amounts of painstaking detailed daily investigation into a region or group and can take years. The result is a detailed rich understanding that can support theory development and model testing. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the approach does not scale and the specific methods used are often context specific. In contrast, rapid ethnographic assessment though it derives from anthropological fieldwork fa- vors reproducibility, speed, and general understanding over exquisite detail. Rapid ethnographic assessment is increasingly widely used in a number of fields from hu- man computer interaction to medicine to counter-terrorism. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the set of tech- niques vary widely. Common themes are key informants, rapid assessment, and field data. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we propose, and demonstrate, a computer-assisted data-to-model approach for rapid ethnographic assessment. The proposed approach is a complement to, not a replacement for, traditional ethnography; and serves to fill a key gap—rapid re- mote assessment. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heart of this approach is open-source text exploitation. The tremendous growth in the amount of digital information available, largely in unstructured or text form makes this approach possible. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semi-automated approaches are efficient when dealing with vast quantities of unstructured texts which cannot be analyzed individually by Subject Matter Experts (SME) in a timely, unbiased and systematic fashion (Corman et al. 2002). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall text analysis approach is often referred to as Network Text Analy- sis (NTA) which encodes a meta-network based on the relationships of words in a text (Carley 1997; Popping 2000) and then comparing the network of texts (Batagelj et al. 2002). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We note that within the field of text-mining there exist a number of techniques each operating independently and researched separately (Manning et al. 2008). These include, but are not limited to entity extraction (Chakrabarti 2002), content analysis (Holsti 1969; Krippendorff 2004), topic modeling (Hofmann 1999; Blei et al. 2004), entity resolution and event discovery (Roth and Yih 2007), theme analysis (Landauer et al. 1998), role discovery (Wang et al. 2010), link extrac- tion (Ramakrishnan et al. 2006), multi-dimensional extraction (Lin et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2009;Dingetal.2010) and meta-network extraction (Carley et al. 2011b; Diesner and Carley 2008). Our approach employs a number of these individual tech- niques, and other techniques not heretofore mentioned such as deduplication and anaphor resolution. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the data-to- model process employs a vast number of distinct methodologies from web-scrapers and sensor feeds to text-mining techniques to network analysis tools to agent-based simulations. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to the data-to-model approach is network analysis. Specifically, this ap- proach involves the extraction, analysis, and then simulation of the impact of various interventions of a network based model of the complex socio-cultural system being analyzed. The system is represented as a meta-network (Carley 2002, 2006) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;meta-network: an ecology of networks linking the who, what, when, where, why and how are collectively incorporated into a multi-mode, multi-link, multi-level network representation system. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human involvement often that of subject matter experts, is critical to the over- all process. From a development perspective, humans played the following roles: (a) developed specialized generalization thesauri, (b) vetted computer generated the- sauri, &amp;copy; vetted extract networks for people to people, ethnic-group/tribe to ethnic- group/tribe, people to ethnic-group/tribe, organization to organization, people to or- ganization, (d) vetted time line, and (e) confirmed results. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2Data (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudan: Social change and situation assessment. 71,000 texts from news-sources, websites, books, and writings by scholars. Project-based thesauri contains 38,552 gazetteer locations and 16,001 entries. Afghanistan: primary and secondary actors and region of influence analysis: 247 large texts from news-sources and websites. Project-based thesauri contains 146,573 entries. Catnet: competitive adaptation analysis: 1,109 texts from news-sources and web- sites. Project-based thesauri contains 28,727 entries. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Data-to-model (D2M) process (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The D2M process mirrors a manual approach that is taken by the analyst for devel- oping a model from unstructured text data: downloading and fixing data, cleaning and preparing text, finding important concepts, forming relationships between con- cepts, attempting initial analysis, further refinement of concepts and relationships with associated re-analysis, and then finally after the output is correct the addition of attributes to the concepts, and final analysis results. Using D2M the analyst converts raw texts to networks; specifically to meta-networks. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A semantic network is a set of interlinked concepts. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A meta-network is a geo-temporal set of interlinked networks connecting nodes in multiple ontological classes. The ontological classes we use are: agents, organi- zations, locations, knowledge, resources, beliefs, tasks and events. Using D2M, con- cepts are extracted, linked into a semantic network, cross-classified into their ontolog- ical class, and attributes of nodes are added. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The D2M process is designed to minimize the strain on the analyst of using net- work text analysis to generate this meta-network model and the difficulty in using a multi-tool cycle to clean the meta-network model. D2M uses various component tools and routines in AutoMap (Carley et al. 2011b) and ORA (Carley et al. 2011a)in predefined sequences. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Component technologies (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of the data-to-model process are two basic sub-tools, AutoMap and ORA. AutoMap and ORA were designed to work together, i.e., the output of AutoMap is directly readable by ORA. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AutoMap (Carley et al. 2011b) is used for text-mining and data extraction. Au- toMap is a toolbox of techniques and approaches for network text analysis. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORA (Carley et al. 2011a) is used for network analytics and simulation. ORA is a toolbox of techniques for network analysis. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Script 1—Meta-network extraction component For data coding, we use machine learning techniques in support of advanced network text analysis. At an abstract and very high level, a network text analysis involves four-steps for converting unstruc- tured texts to meta-networks (Diesner and Carley 2005): (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concept Identification: The analyst identifies what concepts are or are not of in- terest. 2. Entity Identification: The analyst defines an ontology; i.e., the set of entities into which the data will be coded. Typical entity classes are people, organizations, places, resources, tasks, events, and beliefs. Note that step 1 and 2 are temporally interchangeable. 3. Concept Classification: The analyst maps the identified concepts of interest into the entity classes using a meta-network or ontology thesaurus. 4. Meta-network extraction: The analyst using an automated tool, applies the afore- mentioned thesauri and delete lists to the texts. This tool then processes the texts and extracts concepts, cross-classifies them into their ontological category, and then extracts the relation among the identified concepts. The result is a structured dataset containing a meta-network. (p. 9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface this sounds straight forward. It turns out, however, that there are many coding choices that the analyst must make along the way that influence the results (Carley 1993). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3 Detailed description of D2M steps (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3.1 Step 1: Corpus collection (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analyst begins with a corpus of raw texts. These texts can be drawn from any number of sources. For the three data sets we used, data was collected via web- scrapers and/or provided by external sources. Meta-information was removed. Du- plicate texts were removed. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;including emails, news articles, web pages, blogs, twitter or RSS feeds (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the source of the data, deduplication is necessary. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both deduplication and the removal of extraction related information do impact the results. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3.2 Step 2: Corpus cleaning (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corpus cleaning is designed to take the body of the text that the analyst wants to process and augment or alter it to remove various typesetting and linguistic style vagaries. It includes generic preprocessing activities: e.g., typo correction and the ex- pansion of contractions and abbreviations. In addition, during this phase pronouns are resolved and unidentified pronouns removed. This is a completely automated process. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;two phases: syntax-preserving clean- ing and syntax-destroying cleaning. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax-preserving operations include: removal of extra spaces, expansion of contractions and abbreviations, typo correction, pronoun resolution, and British to (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American spelling conversion. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax-destroying operations of the preparation phase include: removing sin- gle letters and noise words, and the replacement of common phrases with its n-gram equivalent. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional step, context-sensitive stemming, is done at the end of the cleaning that uses information generated from the syntax-preserved text and uses it for the last step of the cleaning process. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stemming, using a Porter stemmer (Porter 1980), is only performed on common nouns and common verbs. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these cleaning processes are automated. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3.3 Step 3: Meta-network extraction (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using advanced text-mining techniques the set of texts are processed to generate the meta-network, the semantic network and an initial project thesauri. Concepts are categorized into their appropriate meta-network ontological class, which includes agents, organizations, locations, events, knowledge, resources, beliefs and tasks (Car- ley 2002). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Script 1: Choices and process in creating the automated script To create the script that is now script 1 we went through various non-automated and semi-automated pro- cesses and identified best practices. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first over-arching key issue is degree of generalization. Coding choices can result in the extracted concept set being over- or under-generalized relative to the an- alysts needs. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second overarching key issue is the degree of connection. We found that link extraction was improved by using multiple link-extraction techniques and fusing the results. One technique is proximity based. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then identified a number of preliminary steps to standardize the extraction process and to eliminate non-bearing concepts from across the texts (Carley 1993). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concept identification is a very involved process that includes deleting uninter- esting terms and generalizing others concepts into the set of interest. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entity Identification is a theoretically based step; i.e., it depends on the research questions of interests. The complexity of the data processing and analysis increases nonlinearly as the number of entities increases. Thus, there is a trade-off that one needs to consider when deciding the number of entity classes. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concept classification: This step involves creation of another type of thesaurus, the meta-network or ontology. In general, high quality classification requires employing many classification techniques to create these thesauri. We employ: historical meta- network thesauri developed on other projects including location and world-leader lists, machine learning techniques, parts-of-speech tagging, and specialized meta- network thesauri by SMEs. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta-network extraction: This step is very computer-intensive and results in the extracted networks. We use AutoMap to process the set of texts, applying the thesauri, and generate out a meta-network. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graph and analyze data: At this point, the text has been turned into a structured data set, specifically a meta-network, that can be graphed and analyzed. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have one such meta-network per text. Since there are thousands of texts there are thousands of networks. The next decision the analyst needs to make is which results to combine. This decision is dependent on the research question. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if the issue is how different is the view from the newspaper and the scholars then you would create two fused meta-networks (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A yearly compression enabled us to take a longitudinal perspective. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final step was to take all of these findings and solidify them into a workflow that can be used again and on different data sets. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To re-iterate the output of this step is a semantic network, a meta-network, and a project thesauri with both the generalization and the ontology classification compo- nents. These are then reviewed by the analyst in the next cleaning step. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3.4 Step 4: Refinement (thesauri construction and cleaning) (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refinement step uses both human-in-the-loop cleaning and then application of Script 2. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refinement step involves: 1. Merging any concepts that need to be merged; e.g., when there are newly identified alias. 2. Deleting concepts that are not of interest to the study. 3. Checking and fixing the classification of concepts into entity classes. 4. Checking and fixing the classification of concepts as specific or generic. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Script 2 and refinement: choices and process (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first choices made had to do with locations. While locations of interest, such as cities and countries (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second choice is centered around how to treat n-grams as a single concept. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third choice centered on the provision of n-grams to the analyst for review. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The D2M process will extract a meta-network (nee social network) as it appears in the text (Diesner and Carley 2005). Concepts that do not contribute to the final meta- network can be removed early in the text processing, and then will not appear in future codings. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3.5 Step 5: Final meta-network extraction (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the analyst is satisfied with the refinement of the concepts the final meta- network is extracted. This is a completely automated process. All thesauri and coding choices selected earlier are applied. The resultant network can then be read into ORA for assessment or it can be augmented with additional data. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;meta-network will include both the semantic network— as a network of all concepts to all concepts and a set of subnetworks based on the ontologically cross-classified concepts. This meta-network will include both forms of the cross-class networks. A cross-class network is a bipartite network; i.e., a net- work formed from two entity classes, such as agent x organization and organization x agent. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3.6 Step 6: Data augmentation (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data augmentation uses additional data sets and rules of inference to augment the extracted networks. Three types of additional data are typically used: geo-spatial, attribute files and meta-data. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geo-Spatial Augmentation: Using post-processing geo-information, latitude and longitude, are added to facilitate analysis and visualization. For this purpose we used GeoNames (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geonames.org&#34;&gt;http://www.geonames.org&lt;/a&gt;), which is an open source gazetteer site. Alter- natively NGIA GeoNET (&lt;a href=&#34;http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/&#34;&gt;http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/&lt;/a&gt;) could be used. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attribute files augmentation: Attributes are information about nodes that are of routine important (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta-data: Meta-data is that information in the structured part of a semi-structured data. For example, in email, this is the header information. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final approach to augmentation is inference. Using findings from anthropol- ogy and organization science, ORA has a series of procedures for inferring beliefs and group membership. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3.7 Step 7: Network analytics and forecasting (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting meta-network can then be processed using network analysis routines in ORA (Carley et al. 2011a). (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the KBC model draws on the constructivist-oriented theories, researchers directly involved in developing KBC argued that the KBC has moved social-cultural framework beyond the acquisition of knowledge and appropriation of practices to that of creation of knowledge. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scardamalia, Bereiter, and Lamon (1994) have criticized the current Vygotskian’s view as overly focused on the internal cognitive structures of the learners while neglecting the social structures that facilitate knowledge advancement. The key element that distinguishes the KBC from the social-cultural framework is its emphasis on critical and creative work on ideas. This focus shifts the attention of a learning situation from internalization of existing practices and knowledge to the co-construction of new knowledge. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is through discourse that knowledge or ideas are constructed, negotiated and improved (Lamon, Reeve, Scardamalia, 2001). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis models of CSCL (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the earlier attempts to analyze content is the model proposed by Henri (1992) that includes five dimensions and their categories as shown in Table 1. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another model proposed by Newman, Webb and Cochrane (1996) was designed to measure critical thinking (see Table 2). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background of the Study and Methodology (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study is a post-hoc analysis of the online interactions that were produced by a group of 11 in-service teachers and the tutor. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Questions The research question for this study is “how do teachers build knowledge collaboratively?” This is broken down into the following specific research questions: 1. What is the pattern of participation among the teachers? 2. What is the pattern of interaction among the teachers? 3. To what extent are the teachers building knowledge collaboratively? (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The log files were generated by subjecting the database to the Analytic Toolkit® (Burtis, 1998) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflective notes written by the researchers after the lessons supplemented the data. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Analysis (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results and Discussion (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, the database grew by 25.6 notes per week with each teacher contributing about 2.33 notes in a week. The number of words written by each teacher in a week is about 300. The results suggest that the participation rate is relatively high although it is difficult to make accurate comparison with other studies because of the different contexts involved. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the present study, the facilitator posting is 2.4 times (5.63 notes) that of the teachers’ postings. This result may indicate that active participation by the facilitator is crucial in developing and sustaining discussion among teachers. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average percentage of notes read for this study is 48%. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dividing the total number of notes by the total number of clusters yields the average length of threads. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 42 unconnected notes in the database and 30 clusters of connected notes. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 250 notes in total (including the facilitator’s notes) the mean note cluster size for this study is 3.47. The result implies that for every note posted, it received two to three responses. This result suggests that the discussions are not adequately sustained (Lipponen et al., 2003). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Dimension of Participation (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the data in Table 5, the density of the network in term of participants building on each other’s notes is computed using social network analysis. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these premises, the density of Table 6 is computed to be 0.67. Lipponen et al. (2003) considered a density of 0.37 from his study as high. The density of the present study is therefore quite high. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these findings, it seems that the teachers are well connected with each other, indicating that the community is fairly well established. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Building Dimension (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion of Phase 1a occurrences (49) to the rest of the coded occurrences (179) is approximately 1:4. The result indicates that the teachers were able to built-on to each other’s ideas. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as illustrated by the bar chart and the pie chart in figure 3, most knowledge building activities were limited within Phase 1, i.e., sharing and comparing information. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results seem to indicate that higher phases of co-construction of knowledge are difficult to achieve. Reviews of studies on teacher networked-based learning had also yielded similar results (see Zhao &amp;amp; Rop, 2001). While the technological affordances of networked environment seems to provide an avenue for collaborative learning, there seems to be a higher possibility for the participants to share information and perhaps request for elementary clarification. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several possible reasons that could account for the results obtain is this study. First, detecting dissonance and building on ideas is a cognitively demanding task. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related study on teachers’ perception of learning in this environment suggested that time constraint is a real issue for the teachers (Chai, Tan &amp;amp; Hung, 2003). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, criticizing each others’ practices maybe culturally not an appropriate behaviour since it may be perceived as confrontational. The cultural norms of niceness among teachers may have discouraged the teachers from engaging in critical discussion (Lampert &amp;amp; Ball, 1999). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, teachers’ friendship and collegiality may work in a way that instead of providing a trusting relationship for critical dialogue, it reduces teachers’ willingness to engage in activities that could be questioning the validity of certain beliefs (Kelchtermans, 2004). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, teachers were traditionally treated as implementers of education decisions made outside the classrooms. The shift of role from knowledge consumer to that of knowledge producer is not an easy one as most graduate students may testify. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study examined the pattern of participation and discourse analysis of the online interaction among the online interactions of a group of 11 teachers in the context of professional development. The results indicated that the community established through the combination of face-to-face and online interactions was rather cohesive. The teachers’ participation in the online environment in terms of both reading and responding to each other’s notes was also relatively high and their interactions were task-focused. Based on the results obtained, it seems fair to conclude that the teachers had managed to appropriate some practices of the KBC. However, the depth of interaction was still lacking even when the social conditions exist. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this study suggests that cohesiveness at the level of distributed reading and built-on is a necessary but insufficient condition for in-depth knowledge building. For in-depth knowledge building discourse to happen within the context of teacher professional development, the teachers need to challenge the cultural/professional norm of niceness; be able to detect gaps in understanding; have adequate knowledge about the context of another teacher’s classroom; have the necessary social skills in putting across the critical comments; and assumes a new identity of knowledge producer. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chan, C. K. K., &amp;amp; van Aalst, J. (2006). Teacher Development through Computer‐supported Knowledge Building: Experience from Hong Kong and Canadian teachers. Teaching Education, 17(1), 7–26. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1080&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10476210500527907&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose a framework for designing teacher education courses premised on the knowledge-building perspective developed by Scardamalia and Bereiter (2003) to illustrate how teacher education may encourage teachers to become inquirers and knowledge creators in a knowledge-building community. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We argue that we need a fundamental shift in epistemology about teaching and learning; we need to design courses that model the goals and processes of new conceptions of learning. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Building and Teacher Learning (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, current teacher education programs often focus on maintaining status quo (Elliott &amp;amp; Morris, 2001) and reproducing current practice (Luke et al., 2000) rather than developing innovative ways to prepare teachers for the complexity of changes. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In designing teacher education courses for pre-service and in-service teachers using a knowledge-building epistemology, the courses went beyond helping participants understand certain theories and application or skills; they placed teachers directly at the sites of discourse to develop their competence in (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;inquiry, reflection, collaboration, in moving towards knowledge creation. Focus was placed on helping teachers work in communities engaging in progressive discourse inquiring and generating new possibilities. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher education often espouses new ideas about how teaching and learning should work, but in practice it is often compartmentalized. Knowledge building focuses on student agency in raising authentic problems and engaging in progressive discourse. As such, pre-service and in-service teachers ask questions that are important to them, and such questions would necessarily be much more likely to go beyond the confines of a specific subject or a curriculum area. In fact, new teacher education should help teachers to go beyond the confines of their settings, moving from classrooms to the broader local and international communities. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study provided an example of how teacher education can provide opportunities for teachers located in different parts of the world to work collaboratively as a knowledge-building community. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge building is more than another set of pedagogical practices; it focuses on teachers reexamining their own beliefs and epistemologies. Going beyond “knowledge acquisition” and “participation” (Sfard, 1998), knowledge building focuses on progressive inquiry and knowledge generation. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to continue to pursue questions about how teachers and teacher educators can engage in moving beyond their best practice personally and collectively. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Building and Pedagogical Principles (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what we have learned, we proposed a framework with several design principles for computersupported knowledge building in teacher education. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, teachers need to focus on problems as starting points for their learning. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encouraged teachers to identify problems relating to authentic contexts. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of problems and questions as the starting points in our knowledgebuilding approach helps the teacher participants to uncover discrepancies and to deal with the complexity of changes. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, teachers need to engage in inquiry and dialogue with others. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In designing for teacher learning, teacher participants need to engage in dialogue and discourse; they need to view ideas and practice as something that can be examined, debated, and improved as a developing process. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, teachers do not learn individually; they learn collaboratively as a community. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a sense of community with shared goals, we can affirm, plays an important role in teacher learning. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, teachers need to have agency in assessing their own and collaborative learning. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We emphasized that assessment, learning, and collaboration need to be integrated in teacher education courses. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-service and inservice teachers need to be engaged constantly in selfand peer-assessments. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned from the teachers’ portfolios that they could not isolate their own best work; they described their good notes in relation to what others had contributed to the discussion. Together with the instructors, the teacher participants were co-learners and co-designers and we built a new understanding about the electronic portfolios, making it a more sophisticated assessment tool. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Building and Socio-cultural Contexts (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the knowledge-building approach work for Hong Kong teachers, taking into consideration cultural and contextual constraints? (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While teacher collaboration in lesson studies is common in Japan, the concept of teacher learning communities is just emerging in Hong Kong. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on contributing to others in the community is consistent with traditional Chinese ways of thinking. Research on the Chinese Learner has shown interesting findings indicating that collaborative learning does take place informally among Chinese students, even though much less so formally in a classroom setting (Tang, 1996). (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Education Reforms in Hong Kong now provide opportunities for new forms of teacher and student learning, but many complexities and problems exist with implementation of policies, changing epistemologies, and constraints in school systems. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many questions need to be explored about how knowledge building can work in local contexts. Changing pedagogy must be examined in relation to the broader learning contexts with different norms and practices. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, teachers can tackle the problem of how the traditional emphasis on examinations and the current Education Reform goals can possibly coexist in Hong Kong schools. Together, we can strive to create the kinds of new knowledge and practice that are valued in the local educational contexts. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers find it difficult to implement new forms of teaching in Hong Kong schools even when they are supported in the context of educational reforms. Policy statements and classroom practice are often quite apart. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen, W., Looi, C.-K., &amp;amp; Tan, S. (2010). What do students do in a F2F CSCL classroom? The optimization of multiple communications modes. Computers &amp;amp; Education, 55(3), 1159–1170. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.013&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: An interesting descriptive (or exploratory) case study investigating student online &amp;amp; F2F communication in a CSCL environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small groups of students interacted face- to-face over a computer-mediated communication (CMC) technology called Group Scribbles (GS) to jointly complete a learning task. The lesson designers attempted to optimize the use of CMC technology and face-to-face (F2F) discussion in students’ collaborative learning, with the aim of harnessing the specifi c features of each medium. Building on notions from communication studies and from interaction analysis, we observed the construction and evolution of the interactions through analyzing the artifacts that were produced by a group of students – in verbal talk, gestures, and sketches drawn and text inscribed in GS. F2F and GS interactions intertwined to support collaborative learning. The fi ndings from this study could inform design aspects concerning integrating and reinforcing the strengths of both communication modes when introducing computer-assisted collaborative learning (CSCL) in a F2F classroom. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work reported here is part of a large scale 3-year research project investigating how to design and support students collaborative learning using a computer technology named GroupScribbles (GS). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literature review (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies have been widely applied in the fi eld of education. They can remove time and space restrictions of the typical classroom setting (Curtis &amp;amp; Lawson, 2001; Harasim, Hiltz, Teles, &amp;amp; Turoff, 1995; Henri, 1992). They allow learners to have more time to think “deeply” before giving opinions (Moore, 2002), and promote discussion among learners to create a platform for the creation of knowledge (Gay, Sturgill, Martin, &amp;amp; Huttenlocher, 1999). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bene fi ts of incorporating CMC technology in learning and education include increasing student engagement, enhancing opportunities for dialogue, debate, and the potential for a sense of community, enhancing critical analysis, refl ection, and higher-order thinking, and promoting the social construction of knowledge as well as collaborative thinking (Adelskold, Alklett, Axelsson, &amp;amp; Blomgren, 1999; Collins &amp;amp; Collins, 1996; Dehler &amp;amp; Parras-Hernandez, 1998; Jonassen, Prevish, Christy, &amp;amp; Stavulaki, 1999; Ruberg, Moore, &amp;amp; Taylor, 1996). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;). Sutton (2001) stated that CMC technology has caused the shift from correspondence learning to social learning, increasing interaction with other students as well as with the teacher. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMC has some disadvantages as compared with F2F communication. Hara (2002) indicated that students are required to make assumptions about meaning (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F2F interactions contribute to a higher level of socialization and sense of togetherness (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our design-based research adopted a blended collaborative learning model that integrates both CMC technology and F2F discussion in the classroom with the aim of harnessing the advantages of the specifi c features of each communication mode. There are three actors in this F2F CSCL environment: the teacher as the facilitator, the student as the task performer/problem solver, and the different communication modes (GS and F2F interaction) as the mediator of the collaboration process. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research question of this study is: how do students use a communication mode to perform different kinds of activities to collab- oratively complete a task when multiple modes of communication are available to them at the same time? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frameworks for interaction analysis of collaboration (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take the perspective of interaction analysis as the analytical tool of this study. Interaction analysis is an interdisciplinary method for the empirical investigation of human relations with each other and environment (Jordan &amp;amp; Henderson,1995). In the CSCL community, there is interest in analyzing the interactional processes in online learning environments (Suthers, Dwyer, Medina, &amp;amp; Vatrapu, 2007). In analyzing interactions in such environments, researchers have to take into account the construction and manipulation of representations on the shared workspace which may or may not be augmented by face-to-face interactions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the group ’ s intersubjective meaning-making (Suthers, 2006), common ground (Clark &amp;amp; Brennan, 1991) and a shared world (Stahl, 2008). The works of Dillenbourg (1999) and Stahl, Koschmann, and Suthers (2006) call for the need to design process-oriented methodologies to analyze interactions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garcia and Jacobs ’ work was adapted by Stahl (2009) to study maths chat interaction in dual– space interaction environments using the concept of turn-taking and adjacency pair. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suthers et al. (2007) developed the methodology of uptake analysis and the notation of uptake graphs to analyze how knowledge building is accomplished in a computer-mediated collaborative environment involving a chat stream and evidence mapping tool. Uptake is the description of the act of a participant taking reifi cations of prior or ongoing participation as being relevant for further participation in an ongoing process of meaning-making (Suthers et al., 2007). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in this paper, we will use a descriptive-interpretive interactional analysis approach to analyze both face-to- face discourse as well as media representations on the CSCL environment. We will describe all the student– student and student– interface interactions in this media-rich environment by presenting the discourse, behaviour, and media representations of members of a group. Multiple point logs to analyze the interactional scripts to capture the overall picture of the collaboration process will be used (Looi &amp;amp; Chen, 2010 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMC technology used in classroom - GroupScribbles (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. GS user interface presents each user with a two-paned window (Fig.1 ). The lower pane is the user’ s personal work area, or “private board”, with a virtual pad of fresh “scribble sheets” onwhich the user can draw or type. A scribble can be shared by being dragged and dropped on the public board in the upper pane which is synchronized across all devices. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essential feature of the GS is the combination of the private board where students can work individually and group boards or public boards where students can post the work and position it relative to others, view others’ work, and take items back to the private board for further elaboration. GS is a general-purpose collaboration tool in the sense that we do not have to need to have a pre-defi ned topic or task. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context, participants &amp;amp; lesson design (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ach student was equipped with a Tablet PC (TPC) with GS client software installed. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of introducing GS into a classroom is to change the traditional patterns of classroom talk. A very common pattern in classroom talk is IRE (a teacher initiation (I) is followed by a student reply &amp;reg;, followed by an evaluation of this reply (E) by the teacher (See Mehan,1979)). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing such deep-seated traditional patterns of classroom discourse poses a considerable degree of challenge for classroom reform. Our design is not just to introduce GS technology into the classroom, but to transform the socio- constructivism pedagogy enabled by GS. Scardamalia and Bereiter (1994) stated that learning is a dialogic, social and cultural process, whereby the learners form a community, therefore providing social, emotional and cognitive support to each other. Our aim is to transform the traditional lecture-based F2F lessons into more student-centered ones by connecting students together by the networked technology. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical collaborative pattern when a student group is jointly doing a task is as follows: Individual group member works on the private space in the Tablet PC respectively, then posts to a group board which is synchronized to all group members. They build on each other’ s ideas and create the group artifact. After fi nishing the group task, they visit other groups’ board, learn others’ ideas and give comments and suggestions. After visiting all other groups’ boards, they will go back to the home group board to check the comments and suggestion given by other groups, and further refi ne the ideas. At the end of the session, the groups that have the best group product present their work to the whole class. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case study method &amp;amp; data collection (p. 4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A descriptive case study has been carried out to examine what happens in an event or activity in depth. The case examined in this study is a small group collaborative learning scenario. The purpose of this study is to describe the behaviors of students when they are doing group work. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We randomly chose one scenario from the whole dataset as the case for this study. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a Primary 5 science activity that requires the students to discuss confi gurations of connecting a light bulb with batteries in a circuit so that the bulb will light up. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We randomly chose one group from the 10 groups in the class. The group comprised 4 students, and their seating arrangement is as shown in Fig. 4. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When collecting data on the collaborative learning of this group, one researcher sat beside this group and took down detailed fi eld observation notes. A video camcorder was placed at the side to record the group interaction. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the analysis, we chose to focus on the participants’ interactions regarding substantial questions/problems related to the study case. The actions included how students worked individually and collaborated on the tasks through creating or editing artifacts on GS, verbal conversation and their physical gestures. When doing the transcript analysis, we focus on the role of different communication modes in different stages of doing the task to investigate how F2F and GS interaction intertwined to support collaborative learning. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data analysis &amp;amp; findings (p. 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transcript (shown in Appendix A) we have chosen is a typical instance of the target group’s interaction. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the interactions transcribed in Appendix A serve some purpose in the process of students’ collaborative learning. The interactions in the process of students’ collaborative learning in this group can be categorized based on the different stages of the collaborative learning activity: task distribution and coordination, individual cognitive work, within group negotiation, cross-group meaning making, and consolidation. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.1. Task distribution and coordination (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.2. Individual cognitive work (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.3. Within-group negotiation (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.4. Cross-group meaning-making (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion and conclusion (p. 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the transcript, most of the discourse involves student– student interactions. The discourse in this group is multidirectional rather than bi-directional. Multidirectional dialogue exchanges could enhance students’ cognitive development (Gillies, 2006). This transitive discussion contributes to productive meta-cognitive deci- sions, by making students think publicly, and exposes their ideas to critical scrutiny (Goos, Galbraith, &amp;amp; Renshaw, 2002). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are traces of various uptakes from representations in GS or from F2F verbal discussions. As the students’ learning interactions were constructed in real time through concrete verbal and GS interactions, this provides the foundation for knowledge being evolved as a product of interpersonal meaning making. The construction of knowledge becomes much more of a group achievement, resulting from the intricate semantic intertwining of postings and references rather than being attributable to individuals (Stahl, 2009). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data analyses show that the students in the group made use of GS as a platform to represent their initial cognitive thinking and under- standing. The time delay and permanence of CMC allows for ‘ think before talking’ (Veerman, Andriessen, &amp;amp; Kanselaar, 2000). Jonassen, Davidson, Collins, Campbell, and Haag (1995) stated that the nature of CMC allows for “collective thinking” and time for reflection, leading to higher quality interactions. The process of writing and refl ecting may encourage higher-level learning such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, and promote clearer and more precise communication (Garrison, 1997; Jonassen &amp;amp; Kwon, 2001; Sapp &amp;amp; Simon, 2005). GS enables the students to focus on individual idea generation before beingexposed tothe ideas of others and discussing with them. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the class is networked via the GS technology, the students have the opportunity to learn and gain more exposure from the artifacts of other groups. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do not need to search for the contributions of others. Stahl (2009) considers this as a “ non- trivial requirement” for good groupware since the work of a group quickly becomes too extensive for everyone to read and keep track of it. GS keeps track of the development of the students’ work - all the input is stored in a communal database for future reference and this facilitates the sharing of knowledge and ideas. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intertwining of online and F2F modalities play an important role in unifying and strengthening the student collaborative learning experience described in this paper. GS and F2F interactions are complementary to each other rather than supplementary to each other. The fi ndings from this study support Media Richness Theory (Daft &amp;amp; Lengel, 1986) in that richer media (e.g., F2F interaction) are more effective for equivocal tasks, and leaner media (e.g., GS) are better for unequivocal tasks. Effective collaborative learning often involves both equivocal and unequivocal tasks. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study is an exploratory study analyzing one group of students’ interactive behaviors when doing a learning task. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Chen2012c&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen, Y.-C., Hwang, R.-H., &amp;amp; Wang, C.-Y. (2012). Development and evaluation of a Web 2.0 annotation system as a learning tool in an e-learning environment. Computers &amp;amp; Education, 58(4), 1094–1105. doi:10.1016/j.compedu.2011.12.017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study implements MyNote, the web annotation system primarily tied to an LMS, and evaluate usability of this system with students. This system does not adhere to any web annotation standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to develop a Web 2.0 annotation system, MyNote, based on the Web 2.0 core concepts which emphasize ease of access and active sharing and then to gain an understanding about people’s perceptions of MyNote from a usability perspective. (p. 1094)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MyNote was employed on multimedia learning objects in a Learning Management System (LMS), and out of the LMS as well (p. 1094)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many researchers have reported that Web 2.0 based learning tools or systems provide effective platforms for collaborative learning and knowledge sharing (Barak et al., 2009; Hwang, Wang, &amp;amp; Sharples, 2007; Jones, Blackey, Fitzgibbon, &amp;amp; Chew, 2010; Su, Yang, Hwang, &amp;amp; Zhang, 2010). However, in a Learning Management System (LMS), the use of blogs or Wikis mainly offers a supplemental place separated from the main learning content and materials for students to share or construct their knowledge. We believe that Web 2.0 technology should be able to provide a more intuitive way for students to learn and to interact at the same time when they focus on learning multimedia materials. (p. 1094)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research questions addressed in this study are: (1) What characteristics does a Web 2.0 annotation system possess in order to foster online learning? (2) How do users perceive MyNote as an online learning tool? (p. 1095)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theoretical framework (p. 1095)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Collaborative learning (p. 1095)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shallow&lt;br /&gt;
 a quick shallow/brief accounts of collaborative learning (p. 1095)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;knowledge is built through interaction with environment, including materials and people (Jonassen, Peck, &amp;amp; Wilson, 1999). (p. 1095)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Annotation system (p. 1095)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the study of online annotation systems utilized in LMS has not been emphasized until recently (Ahern, 2005; Annotea, 2001; Hwang &amp;amp; Wang, 2004; Hwang et al., 2007; Su et al., 2010). (p. 1095)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several studies have shown the benefits of online annotation systems on work efficiency and learning performance (Ahern, 2005; Cadiz, Gupta, &amp;amp; Grudin, 2000; Gupta, Condit, &amp;amp; Gupta, 2008; Hwang et al., 2007; Marshall &amp;amp; Brush, 2004; Nokelainen, Kurhila, Miettinen, Floreen, &amp;amp; Tirri, 2003; Quade, 1996; Robert, 2009; Su et al., 2010). Quade (1996) indicated that students learned more with computer-based annotation, rather than paper-based, in computer-based learning environments. Ahern (2005) found the use of online annotation software – Red Pencil, encouraged students to engage in learning activities. However, the interface design might interfere with students’ reading. Nokelainen et al. (2003) found that EDUCOSM, an annotation system fostered learner-centered collaborative learning and students who liked to use the tool elaborated more about their work. (p. 1095)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workplace, web annotations successfully promote the work efficiency through context-based discussion with documents (Cadiz et al., 2000). Gupta et al. (2008) even created an annotation management system, Graphitti, to facilitate annotation among heterogeneous objects in scientific data. (p. 1095)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;online annotation systems can serve as a “mindtool” (Jonassen, 1996) to inspire student thinking and may act as a catalyst to foster collaborative learning and peer interaction. (p. 1095)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another concern of annotation systems for online learning is its universal use across different browsers and LMSs. Learning online is not only limited within a LMS. On the contrary, learners often search information or resources out of the LMS as supplemental materials. Therefore, annotation systems for online learning should be versatile to accommodate different systems and interfaces. (p. 1096)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azouaou, Chen, and Desmoulins (2004) proposed three principles to develop annotation systems for e-learning, including usefulness, shareability, and usability. (p. 1096)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4. Prototype of Web 2.0 annotation system (p. 1096)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;collective intelligence (p. 1096)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, it should serve as a platform to harness collective intelligence, just like blogs or Wikis with access control. The annotation system not only allows learners to make annotations on multimedia learning objects, more importantly, it also allows them to read annotations made by others, reply to questions posted by others, and search annotations via keywords or category, etc, on learning objects. (p. 1096)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MyNote annotation system (p. 1096)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MyNote Annotation system is embedded in a Learning Management System (LMS). (p. 1096)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. User interface and functions (p. 1097)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation of Web 2.0 annotation system (p. 1101)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of usability testing is to gain users’ feedback in order to improve the interface design and its effectiveness. It emphasizes empirical tests to gather data to evaluate the effectiveness of the interface (Torres, 2002; Treu, 1994). Several methods could be employed in the usability testing process (Nielsen, 1993) based upon the lifecycle stage of products. The questionnaire method was adopted in this study to gain users’ perceptions and experiences when they interact with MyNote annotation system. (p. 1101)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A paper-based questionnaire was developed in two parts to assess the subject’s experience interacting with MyNote and their personal backgrounds. (p. 1101)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A much earlier version of sociometers when they only measure voices for conversation and turn-taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SENSING &amp;amp; MODELING HUMAN NETWORKS (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper describes our work in developing a computational framework to model face-to-face interactions within a community. We have integrated methods from speech processing and machine learning to demonstrate that it is possible to extract information about people’s patterns of communication, without imposing any restriction on the user’s interactions or environment. Furthermore, we analyze some of the conversational dynamics and present results that demonstrate distinctive and consistent turntaking styles for individuals during conversations. Finally, we present results that show strong correlation between a person’s turn-taking style during one-on-one conversations and the person’s role within the network. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sociometer is an adaptation of the hoarder board, a wearable data acquisition board, designed by the electronic publishing and the wearable computing groups at the Media lab [6]. The sociometer stores the following information (i) identity of people wearing the sociometer (IR sensor 17Hz) and (ii) speech information (microphone-8KHz). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: The Sociometer (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEARNING THE SOCIAL NETWORK (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we detect the pair-wise conversations we can measure all the communication that occurs within the community and map the links between individuals. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detecting Conversations (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To detect conversations, we need to reliably segment speech regions from the raw audio. As the first step, we extract spectral features proposed in [2] that discriminate well between speech and non-speech regions. An HMM is trained to detect voiced/unvoiced regions using the features. This method works very reliable even in noisy environment with less than 2% error at 10dB SNR. However, the downside of this is that all speech and not just the user’s speech are detected. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can use the energy of the speech signal to segment the user’s speech from the rest. When two people are nearby and are talking, although it is highly likely that they are talking to each other, we cannot say this with certainty. Results presented in [2] demonstrate that we can detect whether two people are in a conversation by relying on the fact that the speech of two people in a conversation is tightly synchronized. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can reliably detect when two people are talking to each other by calculating the mutual information of the two voicing streams, which peaks sharply when they are in a conversation as opposed to talking to someone else. This measures works very well for conversations that are at least one minute in duration. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TURN-TAKING DYNAMICS (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We primarily focus on the turn-taking patterns of individuals and how they differ from each other. We use these individual dynamics to later estimate how much an individual’s overall pattern changes during her interaction with specific individuals. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by defining a “turn”. For each unit of time we estimate how much time each of the participants speaks, the participants who has the highest fraction of speaking time is considered to hold the “turn” for that time unit. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the speaker segmentation output within conversations to estimate the turn-taking transition probability. Because most of the conversations in the dataset are between pairs, we transition between two states: speaker A’s turn and speaker B’s turn. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have estimated the turn-taking transition probabilities for the individuals we can measure how similar or dissimilar they are from each other. Figure 6 shows the output of multidimensional scaling of the transition probabilities using a Euclidean distance metric, which shows that individuals have distinctive turn-taking styles and that these turn-taking patterns are not just a noisy variation of the same average style. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating Influences from Turn-taking Dynamics (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now by learning the influence parameters we can measure how much one person affects another’s turn-taking behavior. We discovered an interesting and statistically significant correlation between a person’s influence score and their centrality, the correlation value was 0.90 (p-value &amp;lt; 0.0004, rank correlation 0.92). It appears that a person’s interaction style is indicative of her role within the community based on centrality measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choudhury, T., Borriello, G., Consolvo, S., Haehnel, D., Harrison, B., Hemingway, B., … Wyatt, D. (2008). The Mobile Sensing Platform: An Embedded Activity Recognition System. IEEE Pervasive Computing, 7(2), 32–41. doi:10.1109/MPRV.2008.39&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A seemingly early work of mobile sensing leading to fitness products like Fitbit. The article introduces an iterative process of designing and testing generations of mobile sensing devices. It highlights the importance synergy between hardware and software (machine learning algorithms) in order to accurately detect and classify physical activities. It concludes with three important functionalities of a mobile sensing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past four years, we’ve been­ buildin­g an­ automatic activity recogn­ition­ system usin­g on­-body sen­sors. The Mobile Sen­sin­g Platform (MSP) tackles several of these design­ an­d deploymen­t challen­ges. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity recognition systems (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity recogn­ition­ systems typically have three main­ compon­en­ts: • a low-level sensing module that con­tin­uously gathers relevan­t in­formation­ about activities usin­g microphon­es, accelerometers, light sen­sors, an­d so on­; (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• a feature processing and selection module that processes the raw sen­sor data in­to features that help discrimin­ate between­ activities; an­d • a classification module that uses the features to in­fer what activity an­ in­dividual or group of in­dividuals is en­gaged in­—for example, walkin­g, cookin­g, or havin­g a con­versation­. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recen­t studies have shown­ that the in­formation­ gain­ed from multimodal sen­sors can­ offset the in­formation­ lost when­ sen­sor readin­gs are collected from a sin­gle location­.4,5 (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature might be low-level in­formation­, such as frequen­cy con­ten­t an­d correlation­ coefficien­ts, or higherlevel in­formation­ such as the n­umber of people presen­t. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For wide-scale adoption­ of activity recogn­ition­ systems, we hypothesized the n­eed for a sen­sin­g platform that • packages multimodal sen­sors in­to a sin­gle small device, • avoids usin­g physiological sen­sors or sen­sors that require direct con­tact with the skin­, an­d • either in­tegrates in­to a mobile device, such as a cell phon­e, or wirelessly tran­smits data to an­ extern­al device. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;deployments (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our in­itial deploymen­ts focused on­ gatherin­g real-world activity traces for train­in­g activity classifiers. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presen­tation­ here of our developmen­t process in­cludes lesson­s learn­ed at each stage an­d how the lesson­s con­tributed to our curren­t system. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware platform v1.0: Wireless multimodal sensing (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we design­ed an­d built a multimodal sen­sor board that simultan­eously captured data from seven­ differen­t sen­sors (see figure 1). (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In­ addition­, we con­ducted a larger, lon­gitudin­al deploymen­t to gather data on­ group in­teraction­s an­d face-to-face social n­etworks.10 (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our in­itial deploymen­ts showed that storin­g an­d processin­g data locally would sign­ifican­tly in­crease the data quality (n­o packet loss) an­d recordin­g duration­ (via compression­), while reducin­g the physical burden­ on­ the participan­t. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication, storage, and processor issues. The Bluetooth con­n­ectivity wasn­’t reliable en­ough (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy. The larger group deploymen­t reen­forced the importan­ce of con­siderin­g privacy aspects of data loggin­g. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version­ 2.0’s option­al daughterboard provides 3D magn­etometers, 3D gyros, a 3D compass, an­d a USB host. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore n­eeded the iPAQ’s computation­al resources to process the raw audio data on­ the fly an­d record useful features. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location sensing. The differen­t MSP sen­sors were sufficien­t for recogn­izin­g the ran­ge of daily activities an­d in­teraction­s that in­terested us. However, geographical location­ in­formation­ has proved helpful in­ activity recogn­ition­.11 (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery life. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In­ some cases, kn­owin­g just the location­ is en­ough to in­fer coarse-level activities. In­tegratin­g location­ sen­sin­g in­to the platform would en­able us to support a wider ran­ge of con­text-aware application­s. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware platform v2.0: Local storage, better processor and battery life (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;data processing and inference (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By automatically in­ferrin­g the features that were most useful, we discovered that two modalities in­ particular (out of seven­) yielded the most discrimin­ative in­formation­ for our activities—n­amely, the accelerometer an­d microphon­e. These two modalities provide complemen­tary in­formation­ about the en­viron­men­t an­d the wearer. The audio captures soun­ds produced durin­g various activities, whereas the accelerometer data is sen­sitive to body movemen­t. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-world deployments and applications (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first in­ situ study of the UbiFit Garden­ system was a three-week field trial (N = 12) con­ducted durin­g the summer of 2007. (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ubiFit garden field study (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UbiFit Garden­ is an­ application­ that uses on­-body sen­sin­g, real-time activity in­feren­ce, an­d a mobile ambien­t display to en­courage in­dividuals to be physically active. UbiFit Garden­ uses the MSP to in­fer five types of activities: walkin­g, run­n­in­g, cyclin­g, usin­g an­ elliptical train­er, an­d usin­g a stair machin­e. (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Form factor. The sen­sin­g device must be small an­d un­obtrusive yet capable of recogn­izin­g a broad ran­ge of activities. (Our curren­t prototype is still too large for commercial use, but study participan­ts un­derstood that the device would even­tually be smaller.) A sin­gle multimodal device, as opposed to multiple separate sen­sor n­odes, is likely to gain­ greater user acceptan­ce. (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respon­se to UbiFit Garden­ was overwhelmin­gly positive. At the study’s en­d, most participan­ts said they would prefer a system that in­cluded activity in­feren­ce, such as the MSP, over on­e that relied solely on­ man­ual en­try (study details are available elsewhere14). (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Sensing hardware. The system n­eeds en­ough storage for data loggin­g, sufficien­t computation­al resources for data processin­g an­d run­n­in­g simple in­feren­ce algorithms, wireless con­n­ectivity to drive in­teractive application­s, an­d en­ough battery power to run­ for at least an­ en­tire day. Systems that store data on­ a device used for other purposes, such as a mobile phon­e, must accommodate those other storage n­eeds as well (for example, leavin­g room for savin­g photos). (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall accuracy study (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;other ongoing studies (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On­e project in­volves developin­g algorithms to compute accurate caloric expen­diture from user activities, which we will use to build an­ ambien­t person­al-fuel gauge. (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An­other project is targetin­g Type I diabetics to adjust in­sulin­ dosages on­ the basis of real-time activity in­formation­ an­d thus preven­t dan­gerous hypoglycemic episodes. A third project couples MSP with GPS in­formation­ to better un­derstan­d how urban­ plan­n­in­g affects public health by measurin­g outdoor physical activity levels in­ differen­t types of built en­viron­men­ts. (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three critical capabilities for mobile inference systems&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Form factor. The sen­sin­g device must be small an­d un­obtrusive yet capa- ble of recogn­izin­g a broad ran­ge of activities. (Our curren­t prototype is still too large for commercial use, but study participan­ts un­derstood that the device would even­tually be smaller.) A sin­gle multimodal device, as opposed to multiple separate sen­- sor n­odes, is likely to gain­ greater user acceptan­ce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Sensing hardware. The system n­eeds en­ough storage for data loggin­g, suf- ficien­t computation­al resources for data processin­g an­d run­n­in­g simple in­feren­ce algorithms, wireless con­- n­ectivity to drive in­teractive appli- cation­s, an­d en­ough battery power to run­ for at least an­ en­tire day. Sys- tems that store data on­ a device used for other purposes, such as a mobile phon­e, must accommodate those other storage n­eeds as well (for exam- ple, leavin­g room for savin­g photos).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Recognition software. In­ addition­ to bein­g computation­ally efficien­t, the recogn­ition­ algorithms should min­imize the amoun­t of human­ effort required durin­g train­in­g an­d data labelin­g. It should be easy to exten­d the algorithms to recogn­ize a wide ran­ge of activities an­d to person­alize to a given­ user’s data. (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In­ early 2007, we con­ducted a study to un­derstan­d how well people recall the amoun­t of their active behaviors, such as walkin­g, an­d their seden­tary behaviors, such as sittin­g. (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Ciccarese2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ciccarese, P., Soiland-Reyes, S., &amp;amp; Clark, T. (2013). Web annotation as a first-class object. IEEE Internet Computing, 17(6), 71–75. doi:10.1109/MIC.2013.123&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thorough explanation of the history of web annotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The W3C Open Annotation Data Model provides facilities for annotating content directly on the Web without changing the original content.Third-party semantic annotations of content are now emerging as rst-class objects on the Web. (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars have made handwritten notes and comments in books and manuscripts for centuries. Today’s blogs and news sites typically invite users to express their opinions on the published content; URLs let them share Web resources with accompanying annotations and comments using third-party services such as Twitter or Facebook. These contributions have until recently been constrained within speci c services, making them useful, but second-class citizens of the Web. (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Web annotations are emerging as fully independent linked data in their own right, no longer restricted to plain textual comments in application silos. Annotations can range from bookmarks and comments, to ne-grained annotations of a selected section of a frame in a video stream. Technologies and standards already exist to create, publish, syndicate, mash up, and consume nely targeted, semantically rich digital annotations on practically any content: annotations have become rst-class Web citizens. This development is driven by a need for collaboration and annotation reuse among domain researchers, computer scientists, scienti c publishers, and scholarly content databases. (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do these applications have in common? First, the annotations they support have a shared subject, typically identi ed by a URI (for example, to a webpage, image, or video). Second, these annotations live within a single system, at either the resource provider or a third-party bookmarking site. (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until recently, no common annotation model has existed independently of what is being annotated. (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeing Annotation from Content Silos (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this might not pose a signi cant problem for ordinary social media users, it’s a big problem in digital scholarship. This challenge is driving a signi cant change in how we can implement and reuse annotations across systems and domains. (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content annotation in one form or another is a basic, de ning part of Web 2.0. (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantics, Not Just Comments (p. 72)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2013, Google announced the availability of 800 million documents annotated by 11 billion Freebase concepts.1 This is semantic tagging. (p. 72)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using formal vocabularies specied in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), we can create richer, more computationally tractable structures than by using dictionaries or encyclopedias. Formal ontologies relate elements in one domain to another, using formal predicates, and let us perform automated reasoning over these knowledge structures. They might also supplement, identify, or tag dictionary and encyclopedia entries themselves. (p. 72)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;machine assistance to reading, comprehension, and knowledge accumulation is increasingly necessary (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic tagging or linking is now a reality, and extends beyond Google and Freebase. Perhaps its most important application is in scholarship. For example, the Europe PubMed Central database of scienti c articles (http:// europepmc.org) now semantically tags all its entries with protein, gene, and chemical compound names found in the text. But dealing with these tags raises further important questions. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we represent tags and other annotations? Are they injected in the text, or stored separately? How do we share them across systems? (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by injecting targeted elements from separate annotation stores. When a user accessed a webpage, any annotations of that page could be loaded from and published to separate Annotea servers, one of which the W3C formerly hosted (and which is now decommissioned). Annotea consisted of an RDF schema with an accompanying REST API for annotation discovery and publication. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how can we make this representation live as linked data on the Web — as a rst-class citizen? (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These capabilities are now becoming available to Web developers using linked data annotation tools and models. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it laid out a basic path that subsequent systems followed and exploited. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Annotation Model (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Evolution of Web Annotation (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on RDF and partially inspired by Annotea, two parallel projects were begun independently in 2009: the Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) and the Annotation Ontology (AO). Both models adopted Annotea’s fundamental structure: an annotation with a target (annotated resource) and a body (content) that concerns that target. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, seminal lines of research on the Distributed Link Service (DLS)2 and Conceptual Open Hypermedia (COHSE)3 explored an early form of Web annotation. Their main goal was to enhance collaboration via shared metadata-based Web annotations, bookmarks, and their combinations. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Annotea data model was lightweight. Annotations were stored separately from the documents they annotated, and consisted of three parts. An Annotation instance annotates a Web resource by associating it with a body — another Web resource — such as a comment or reply (typically XHTML embedded as an XML literal). The annotation had provenance properties such as author, created, and modi ed, which specialized corresponding Dublin Core elements. Finally, a context could indicate the speci c selection within an annotated document, typically using an XPointer. Several subclasses of Annotation were de ned — for instance, Question, Comment, or Example. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Annotea, an early W3C project, enabled collaboration by sharing annotations and metadata,4 which were attached to a full or partial webpage. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAC was designed to support digital humanities, whereas AO was geared toward biomedical use cases (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked Data Annotation Tools (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several systems already use annotations to produce linked data. (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DBpedia Spotlight is a tool for automatically annotating mentions of DBpedia resources in text (http:// spotlight.dbpedia.org). (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Domeo Annotation Toolkit (www.annotationframework.org) lets users trigger external text mining services or algorithms and transform their results into annotations that human agents can further curate (see Figure 1). (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utopia Documents (&lt;a href=&#34;http://getutopia&#34;&gt;http://getutopia&lt;/a&gt;. com) is a PDF reader that, when opening a research article, can overlay manipulable visualizations of the data behind the article, providing data analysis tools and links to external resources. (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAC and AO took similar enough approaches to be able to mergeintoasingleproject (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Annotation Model (OA; see the sidebar)6 combined and elaborated these prior projects under the umbrella of the W3C Open Annotation Community Group (www. w3.org/community/openannotation/). The OA model incorporates features from its predecessors, but with further exibility and richness, catering to a wider range of annotation needs. (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another valuable example of annotation and linked data is Maphub (&lt;a href=&#34;https://maphub.herokuapp.com&#34;&gt;https://maphub.herokuapp.com&lt;/a&gt;), an online application for exploring and annotating digitized, high-resolution (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;historical maps (see Figure 2). (p. 75)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OA is new: we’ve never before had a comprehensive, fully featured model for linked data annotations, with signi cant community buy-in. As applications and annotation communities fully adopt this model for their work, linked data annotations will become rst-class, fully interoperable Web citizens — primary Web content in their own right. (p. 75)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter first introduces you to two major types of quantitative research. It then focuses on the characteristics of five quantitative research designs that you will likely encounter as you read research. Knowing about different quantitative research designs will help you read the Method sections of quantitative reports and understand and evaluate the research designs used in quantitative studies. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;quantitative research studies can have differ- ent purposes, such as explaining the effect of an intervention, the relationships among variables, or the trends in a population. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;researchers may use different procedures (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;researchers select an overall plan, called a research design, to guide their choices among all possible procedures that they could use. By knowing how to recognize the different research designs used in quantitative studies, you have a better understanding of how the particular methods and results follow from a study’s purpose (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Do You Identify the Research Design in a Quantitative Study? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A research design is a logical set of procedures that researchers use to collect, analyze, and report their data in a research study. They are considered logical, because all the different procedures fit together in a coherent way to address a specific kind of research purpose. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when the process of research involves quantitative research, then the researcher’s procedures usually include deciding what to study; stating specific, narrow research questions or hypotheses; collecting numeric data from a large number of participants or time points; analyzing the numbers using statistics; and providing objective expla- nations about group differences, relationships, and trends among variables. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 6.1 summarizes the general characteristics of quantitative research (as introduced in Chapter 2 ), and indicates how research designs fit within this process of quantitative research. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative research designs, such as experiments or survey research, provide research- ers with blueprints to guide how they select participants and collect, analyze, and report data in their studies so that they can address their specific research purposes. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blueprints, not strict scripts (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, a well-written quantitative research report includes supporting infor- mation about the design choice in addition to specifying which design has been chosen. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Characteristics Distinguish the Different Research Designs Used in Quantitative Studies? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The develop- ment of quantitative research designs has grown alongside the developments in statisti- cal and measurement procedures. In the late 1800s, researchers began working out basic statistical procedures for relating variables and comparing groups. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1963, Campbell and Stanley had identified several major types of quantitative research designs; these designs’ procedures, strengths, and weak- nesses continue to be refined and expanded today ( Campbell &amp;amp; Stanley, 1963 ; Kerlinger, 1964 ; Shadish, Cook, &amp;amp; Campbell, 2002 ). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fall within two major categories: experimental research and nonexperimental research. Experimental research is used when a researcher intends to test the effect of an interven- tion by manipulating the conditions experienced by participants. Nonexperimental research is used when researchers intend to describe variables without manipulating the conditions experienced by participants. Thus, quantitative research designs differ in terms of: ■ the intent (e.g., to test for cause and effect of an intervention or to describe variables), ■ the use of manipulation (e.g., the researcher does or does not manipulate the conditions experienced by participants), and ■ the procedures used (e.g., procedures for selecting participants, assigning them to groups, collecting data, and analyzing data). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addi- tion, by understanding the different procedures that are used, it is easier to assess the kinds of claims that can rightly be made at the conclusion of different quantitative research studies (e.g., claims that an independent variable caused an effect in a depend- ent variable and claims that the results generalize to a larger population). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental quantitative research is used when the research purpose is to deter- mine whether an independent treatment variable (e.g., taking a special medicine or not) causes an effect in a dependent outcome variable (e.g., feelings of depression). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;manipulation of the conditions (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;measurement of the dependent outcome variable (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental research is also referred to as intervention research (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;carefully controlled (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 6.1 provides a summary of several different types of experimental research designs found in the literature. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When well implemented, experimental design procedures and their emphasis on control can provide strong to moderate evidence that an independent treatment variable caused an effect in another variable. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TABLE 6.1 Intent and Procedures for Different Types of Experimental Research Designs (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many research situations when it is not possible for the researcher to manipulate the conditions experienced by participants. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonexperimental research is also referred to as descriptive or observational research because the variables are described or observed as they happen to occur. Instead of focusing on manipulating and controlling the conditions, nonexperimental research- ers focus attention on such procedures as carefully selecting the participants for the research. To describe trends in a large population, participants are selected so that they are representative of the population; in this way, strong claims can be made that the study results generalize to that population. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 6.2 provides a summary of several different types of nonexperimental research design (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you generally cannot conclude that one of the variables caused an effect in the other because of the lack of manipulation and lack of control in these designs (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TABLE 6.2 Intent and Procedures for Different Types of Nonexperimental Research Designs (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Do You Understand Five Common Quantitative Research Designs? (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As summarized in Figure 6.2 , the five quantitative research designs that we consider are: ■ true experiment design, ■ quasi-experiment design, ■ single-subject research design, ■ correlational research design, and ■ survey research design. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The True Experiment Research Design (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random assignment means that each person who participates in the study has an equal chance of being assigned to the treatment or control conditions. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers Use True Experiments When They Need to Be Certain That a Treatment Causes an Effect. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers use a true experiment when they want to be highly certain that the treatment caused the outcome because true experiments provide the best procedures for controlling all the variables that might influence the outcome. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the “gold standard” for conducting quantitative research because the use of random assignment makes them the best designs for deter- mining whether a treatment causes an effect. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the Characteristics of a True Experiment in a Research Report. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can note the use of a true experiment when researchers label their design as a true experiment, intervention trial, or randomized controlled trial (RCT). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The research problem called for a test of an intervention. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The experimental researcher randomly assigned individual participants to differ- ent conditions. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The experimental researcher manipulated the conditions experienced by partici- pants. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The experimental researcher statistically compared the groups in terms of the out- come variables. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ Strong claims about whether the treatment caused an effect can be made. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quasi-Experiment Research Design (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unable to randomly assign (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he researcher assigns existing groups to the different conditions, but does not randomly assign individuals because groups cannot be artificially created for the exper- iment. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of intact groups, however, is a weakness of this design because it introduces the possibility of other influences that might affect the outcomes. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, quasi-experiments are only able to provide moderate to weak conclusions about the treatment causing a measured effect. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers Use Quasi-Experiments to Determine the Effect of a Treatment for Intact Groups. When you read the report of a quasi-experiment, the focus on determining whether a treatment causes the desired effect is readily apparent. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they do provide useful evidence of interventions that work within naturally occurring groups like those found in your own practice setting. In some quasi-experiment reports, authors refer to their research design generically as an experiment. This means that you need to recognize the identify- ing characteristics to determine whether it is a true or quasi-experiment. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The research problem called for a test of an intervention. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The experimental researcher used intact groups of participants. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The experimental researcher manipulated the conditions experienced by the groups. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The experimental researcher statistically compared the groups in terms of the out- come variables. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ No more than moderate claims about whether the treatment caused an effect can be made. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a difference is found, at best the researchers only can make moderate claims that the treatment caused the measured effect because they cannot account for all other variables that may have influenced the outcome. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Single-Subject Research Design (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single-subject research is a quantitative research design that involves the study of single individuals, the administration of an interven- tion, and the careful monitoring of the individuals’ behaviors before, during, and after the intervention to determine whether the treatment affects the behavior. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the individual becomes his/her own “control” in a single- subject experiment in which the researcher collects many measurements of his/her behavior over time. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers Use Single-Subject Designs When They Want to Affect an Individual. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the Characteristics of Single-Subject Research in a Research Report. In addition to the term single-subject research, you may find that researchers refer to this design as N-of-1 research, applied behavior analysis, or multiple baseline design. Authors also use letters to indicate variants of this design, such as ABAB single-subject design, where A stands for baseline measurements made without the intervention and B stands for measurements made during the intervention. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The research problem called for an intervention to change a behavior that is a prob- lem for an individual. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he researcher states a research purpose that focuses on testing an intervention for the individual to address this need. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The experimental researcher studied a single individual or a few individuals who would benefit from a change in behavior. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The experimental researcher established a baseline of behavior and then manipu- lated the conditions experienced by the individual. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the intervention change its &amp;lsquo;intensity&amp;rsquo; during the study? Should it stay the same in one study? (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The researcher plotted the individual’s behavior over many points of time on a graph and visually inspected the data for change. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;expect the researcher to note how the behavior of the individual changed during the intervention, after withdrawing the intervention, or during multiple interventions. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ Strong claims about whether the treatment caused a meaningful change in the indi- vidual’s behavior can be made. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the high level of control of when and how the intervention was administered, the single-subject researcher often makes strong claims of cause and effect in the Conclusion section. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Correlational Research Design (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unable or uninterested in manipu- lating conditions (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlational research designs are nonexperimental procedures in quantitative research in which investigators measure the degree of association (or relationship) between two or more variables using the statistical procedures of correlational analysis. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlational researchers can conclude that two variables are related to each other, such as when higher motivation scores tend to be associated with higher performance scores. They cannot, however, conclude cause and effect because these designs lack the control found in experimental research. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers Use Correlational Research When They Need to Describe the Relationships Among Variables. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design allows researchers to describe the variables that predict a dependent variable. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, prediction does not require causation! (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the Characteristics of Correlational Research in a Research Report. Correlational research is probably the most common type of quantitative research (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, sometimes studies using this design can be identified by correlational terms such as correlation, association, or prediction. Research studies that use a correlational design share the following characteristics: (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The research problem called for describing the relationship among variables that cannot readily be manipulated. In the Introduction of a correlational study, note that the author usually argues that there is a need to understand how specific vari- ables are related to, associated with, or predict one another. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The correlational researcher studied one group of participants. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The correlational researcher collected information for each variable. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The correlational researcher statistically analyzed the data to test for relationships. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ Claims are limited to the extent to which variables are related to each other; claims of cause and effect are not warranted. Researchers that used a correlational design cannot correctly conclude that some variables cause an effect in other variables because they did not use random assignment or manipulate the conditions (as in an experi- mental design). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some researchers err by making cause-and-effect claims in their correlational reports (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the data were gathered, the researchers used correlation and multiple regression statistical pro- cedures to determine that several variables, including delinquency-related behaviors, age, and substance use, together were significant predictors of nonmedical use of pre- scription drugs by the youth. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Survey Research Design (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey research designs are nonexperimental quantitative proce- dures that researchers use to administer a survey questionnaire to a smaller group of people (called the sample) in order to describe trends in attitudes, opinions, behaviors, or characteristics of a larger group of people (called the population). A hallmark of this design is that the researchers carefully select people to study to ensure that they are rep- resentative of a larger population that is of interest. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word survey is used exten- sively in quantitative research reports. Often it refers to a type of questionnaire used to gather data. Any quantitative study can use a survey ques- tionnaire to gather data. In contrast, a survey research design includes procedures for who to study, how to collect and analyze data, and how to report results. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important distinction (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers Use Survey Research When They Need to Describe Trends in a Population. Researchers choose to use survey research designs when they need to describe trends in a population to understand a research problem. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the Characteristics of a Survey Research Design in a Research Report. Researchers use different names to refer to the use of a survey research design, including descriptive research or population study. Survey research designs can be difficult to distinguish because researchers using any of the quantitative research designs often refer to their questionnaires for gathering data as a “survey.” (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The research problem called for describing the attitudes, opinions, or behaviors of a large group. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The survey researcher selected a large number of participants who are representative of the group. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The survey researcher used a survey questionnaire to gather information from the participants. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ The survey researcher analyzed the data for trends. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ Strong claims about trends in the larger population can be made. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the study’s Conclusion section, expect these claims to be strongly stated if the researcher selected the study sample so that it was representative of the larger population. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Do You Recognize the Research Design in a Quantitative Research Report? (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following four steps can help identify a study’s quantitative research design: (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look to see if the author named the design in the title or abstract of the report. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examine the purpose statement to see if it names or suggests the study’s research design. Researchers select their research designs to match their studies’ pur- poses. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the beginning paragraphs of the Method section and look for a statement that identifies the design. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examine the procedures described within the Method and Results sections. Quantitative researchers often do not name their designs in their reports. When this occurs, look for procedures that suggest a specific research design as you read the Method and Results sections (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good strategy is to first consider whether the study used an experimental or nonexperimental approach, and then consider the specific design within that approach. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;■ Did the researcher manipulate the conditions by providing a treatment to individuals (true, quasi-, or single-subject experi- mental design) or collect data without manipulating the condi- tions experienced by participants (correlational or survey nonexperimental design)? ■ Did the researcher study two or more groups (true or quasi- experiment), one group (correlational or survey design), or one or a few individuals (single-subject design)? ■ Did the researcher randomly assign individuals to different condi- tions (true experiment) or assign intact groups to different condi- tions (quasi-experiment)? ■ Did the researcher randomly select individuals to participate (usu- ally survey design) or use individuals who were conveniently avail- able (usually experiments or correlational design)? ■ Was the focus of the data analysis on comparing groups (usually true or quasi-experiment), inspecting graphs of an individual’s data (single-subject design), describing the relationship among var- iables (usually correlational design), or describing trends (usually survey design)? (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Do You Evaluate the Research Design in a Quantitative Study? (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in a good, rigorous quantitative study, the research design matches the purpose, and the methods of collecting, analyzing, and reporting data match the selected design. A good, rigorous report makes it clear that the researcher had a reason for selecting the design for the study, and that this design is identified, explained, and provided a good overall plan for conducting the study. In addition, the claims that the researcher makes at the end of the study need to be consistent with the overall research design used. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 6.3 lists criteria that are useful to consider when evaluating the research desig (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the rating scale in Figure 6.3 to apply the quality criteria to the research design used in any quantitative research report. For each of the criteria you locate, assign a quality rating from fair (1) to excellent (3) and document your evidence and/or reasoning behind the rating. If one of the criteria is missing or very poorly stated, then indicate poor (0) as your rating. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TABLE 6.3 Criteria for Evaluating the Research Design in a Quantitative Research Report (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice of the research design is appropriate and justified. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good quantitative procedures are used to select and assign participants. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good quantitative data collection procedures are used. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good quantitative data analysis procedures are used. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good quantitative results and conclusions are reported. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Evaluation 6. The study used a rigorous research design. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 All elements of the study from problem to purpose to methods to results to conclusions fit together in a logical, coherent way. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of the quantitative research design addressed the study’s purpose. (p. 21)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clow, D. (2013). An overview of learning analytics. Teaching in Higher Education, 18(6), 683–695. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1080&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;13562517&lt;/sub&gt;.2013.827653&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is rooted in the dramatic increase in the quantity of data about learners and linked to management approaches that focus on quantitative metrics, which are sometimes antithetical to an educational sense of teaching. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It argues that teachers can and should engage with learning analytics as a way of influencing the metrics agenda towards richer conceptions of learning and to improve their teaching. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a tension between the framing of education as an economic activity and conceptions of education and learning that are concerned with the development of meaning and the transformation of understanding. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framing of education as an economic activity supports the view of educational institutions as businesses. Business Intelligence is increasingly applied not only in higher education, in areas such as outreach and advertising, enrolment, management and fund-raising, but also in more academic areas. ‘Dashboards’ showing performance metrics against targets are increasingly popular with senior managers and political pressures, such as the current focus on college completion in the USA, reinforce this direction. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments are not always welcomed by teachers. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics is the application of these Big Data techniques to improve learning. Learning analytics is currently a fixture in educational horizon-scanning reports (see e.g. Johnson et al. 2011; Johnson, Adams, and Cummins 2012; Sharples et al. 2012) and in a raft of other publications aimed at practitioners and aspiring practitioners from organisations concerned with technology in education, such as Educause (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.educause.edu/library/analytics&#34;&gt;http://www.educause.edu/library/analytics&lt;/a&gt;), JISC (&lt;a href=&#34;http://jisc.cetis.ac.uk/&#34;&gt;http://jisc.cetis.ac.uk/&lt;/a&gt; topic/analytics) and SURF (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.surf.nl/en/themas/InnovationinEducation/&#34;&gt;http://www.surf.nl/en/themas/InnovationinEducation/&lt;/a&gt; learninganalytics/Pages/default.aspx). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;big data?&lt;br /&gt;
 Debatable. So is whether LA is about quantitative data. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This increasing activity has a range of drivers and facilitators. First, there is a pressure towards performance management, metrics and quantification. Second, there is an increasing volume of data available about the learners and learning, particularly as more learning takes place online in Learning Management Systems or Virtual Learning Environments (LMS/VLEs). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, statistical and computational tools to manage large data-sets and to facilitate interpretation have become available as a result of the Big Data activity. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key concern in learning analytics is the need to use the insights gathered from the data to make interventions to improve learning, to generate ‘actionable intelligence’ (Campbell, DeBlois, and Oblinger 2007) which informs appropriate interventions. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics is not so much a solid academic discipline with established methodological approaches as it is a ‘jackdaw’ field of enquiry, picking up ‘shiny’ techniques, tools and methodologies (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This eclectic approach is both a strength and a weakness: it facilitates rapid development and the ability to build on established practice and findings, but it to date lacks a coherent, articulated epistemology of its own. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

 This is no need to have a unified epistemology for learning analytics. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having set out learning analytics and its context in broad terms, this paper presents a set of more concrete examples of learning analytics practice to provide a more grounded view of the field. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictive modelling (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of predictive modelling is fairly straightforward: a mathematical model is developed, which produces estimates of likely outcomes, which are then used to inform interventions designed to improve those outcomes. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the output of predictive modelling is a set of estimated probabilities, and it is widely established that many people struggle to correctly understand probabilities and to make consistent decisions based on the probabilistic information. Second, the output is not (typically) restricted to a student’s teacher: the information is readily made available to others beyond the immediate learning context. Third, the output can be used directly to trigger actions and interventions without involving a teacher at all. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Course Signals project at Purdue University (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.itap.purdue.edu/studio/&#34;&gt;http://www.itap.purdue.edu/studio/&lt;/a&gt; signals/) is the most prominent and arguably the most successful application of predictive modelling to student completion in higher education. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with an average of 10 percentage-point increase in grades A and B and a 6 percentage-point decrease in grades D, F and withdrawals. There is an increased overall retention: of the 2007 cohort, 69% of students with no exposure to Signals are retained, compared to 87% of students with exposure to at least one course using Signals. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social network analysis (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These diagrams can be interpreted simply by eye (for example, you can see whether a network has lots of links, or whether there are lots of nodes with few links). Alternatively, they can be interpreted with the aid of mathematical analysis of the network. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNAPP (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.snappvis.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.snappvis.org/&lt;/a&gt;; Bakharia and Dawson 2011) is a SNA tool specifically developed for online learning contexts (Dawson 2010). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suthers and Chu (2012) used SNA to explore the Tapped-In community for educational professionals (&lt;a href=&#34;http://tappedin.org&#34;&gt;http://tappedin.org&lt;/a&gt;). Their approach, inspired by Actor-Network Theory, was much more detailed and rich, based on an ‘associogram’, rather than a simple social network diagram. An associogram is a complex multidirectional mapping of the participants, the artefacts they created (e.g. messages in chat rooms, postings in discussions and shared files) and the actions taken by the participants on those artefacts (e.g. writing/posting and reading). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usage tracking (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many tools exist to capture what a user does on a computer over time, and these can be used as a source of data about student activity when the learning task requires them to use something beyond the LMS/VLE. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santos et al. (2012) developed a dashboard for students on a software development course at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content analysis and semantic analysis (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La ́russon and White (2012) have developed the Point of Originality tool, which enables teachers to track how students develop originality in their use of key concepts over the course of a series of writing assignments. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more speculative example is an automated feedback to students about the nature of their online writing, with the aim of improving the quality of educational dialogue. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendation engines (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and perhaps most obvious area is the ethics of personal data. Foucault (1991) uses Bentham’s Panopticon as a symbol of how institutions and power structures enforce self-surveillance and control through the belief that scrutiny may occur at any time. The nightmare vision of Big Data for individuals is that the system does not rely on self-surveillance to enforce a disciplinary regime. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being open about learning analytics with students can improve their perceptions of the activity (as with Signals), but openness need not and arguably should not be complete in learning contexts. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students typically know and care more about their own learning situation than even the most dedicated teacher. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educators have a professional responsibility to use tools and methods that can improve students’ learning, and learning analytics offers potentially powerful ways of doing this. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a field, learning analytics is data-driven and is often atheoretical, or more precisely, is not explicit about its theoretical basis. Several authors have sought to ground learning analytics in theory (e.g. Dawson 2008; Suthers et al. 2008; Atkisson and Wiley 2011; Clow 2012), but this is not universal, running the risk of treating the data that have been gathered as the data that matter. The choice of what is measured in learning analytics terms, the selection of metrics is critical. If an educational system is designed to optimise metrics that do not encompass learning, it is likely that learning will be optimised away. For those who care about learning, the choice is to attempt total resistance to the regime of metrics or to take a more pragmatic course and insist on the inclusion of appropriate metrics that do reflect learning.&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well-said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mirroring (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To underpin our work, we have used the Big Five theory of group work [1]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has established five key factors: leadership, mutual performance monitoring, backup behaviour, adaptability and team orientation. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a main clustering algorithm we selected k-means which is the most popular. It is also simple, effective and relatively efficient [20, 21]. We used the WEKA [22] implementation with Euclidean distance measure. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important problem was attribute selection. The performance of clustering algorithms is very sensitive to the quality of the attributes. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the previous section, simple statistical exploration of the data was quite limited. The results suggested the need to consider multiple data attributes simultaneously. Clustering allows us to use multiple attributes to identify similar groups in an unsupervised fashion. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such results are useful for the course co-ordinator. They highlight that Group 1’s behaviour is distinguished from the others. The co-ordinators had some sense that this group was well managed but this cluster analysis pointed to the particular behaviours that distinguished this group. We only noticed these after the results of the data mining prompted us to look at particular parts of the TRAC sight and to see the way they used tickets. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new understanding was used in subsequent teaching and was judged by the facilitators to be helpful. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our interpretation of the characteristics in Table 6, a cluster label was assigned (“Managers”, “TRACoriented developers”, “Loafers” and “Others”). The distribution of students from each group into these 4 clusters is presented in Table 7 (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main approaches to sequential pattern mining: apriori-based [25] and pattern-growth methods [28, 29]. Both of them find the same results but the pattern growth approach is much faster. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of our data which is ignored by mining techniques such as clustering is the timing of events. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A data mining technique which considers this temporal aspect is sequential pattern mining [25]. (p. 8)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:::New note&lt;br /&gt;
 apparently, they run with a very low support and pick those ones showing greater difference.&lt;br /&gt;
 so we do not necessarily need 50% of support.::: (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran the GSP algorithm with a very low support threshold because when patterns are found to be frequent in one group, we need to compare this with the exact frequency in other groups where they are not frequent. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the best groups had many alternations of SVN and wiki events, and also SVN and ticket events whereas weaker groups had almost none. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the overall number of patterns found was very high (up to 40,000), only the ones that are frequent in at least one group and low in at least one other were retained, reducing easily that number down to a humanly manageable size of about 50. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the least successful group displayed a high level of alternating wiki and ticketing events, but also had a distinctive lack of sequences containing SVN events. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the best group was one of only two groups to display the patterns (1tb)(1sb) and (1sb)(1tb) – the first likely being a ticket being accepted by a team member and then SVN work relating to that task being completed and the second likely being work being done followed by the ticket being closed. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the top group used the ticketing system more than the wiki, whereas the weakest group displayed the opposite pattern. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another series of patterns which characterised the best groups were tickets being initiated by non-leader group members (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pattern which characterised the poorest group was the tracker creating and editing many tickets, for example in the patterns (1tT), (1tT)(1tb) and (2tT). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that the two top groups had by far the greatest percentage support for the pattern (1tL)(1tb), which were most likely tickets initiated by the leader and accepted by another team member. The fact that this occurred more often than (1tL)(2tb), suggests that the better groups were distinguished by tasks being performed on the wiki or SVN files before the ticket was closed by the (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.7 Limitations of Sequential Pattern Mining (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that the top group had very high support for patterns where the leader interacted with group members on tickets, such as (L1t)(b1t)(L1t). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A problem with our mining program itself is the lack of gap constraints – as noted in [25], a frequent subsequence of (X)(Y) may not be meaningful if many other events occur between X and Y. Another issue is the need for more automated methods of processing output which go beyond manual sorting techniques. Emergent pattern mining [32] and contrast sets [33] may be possible solutions. Finally, there still remained the need to assign meaning to the patterns in order to learn about group work in general. The importance of finding the right balance between alphabets that are too abstract (limiting interpretation) and those which are too specific cannot be understated. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the best group displayed the highest support for patterns such as (b3t) and (b4t), suggestive of group members making at least one update on tickets before closing them. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this group also displayed higher than average support for patterns of interaction involving multiple team members, such as (b1t)(c1t)(L1t). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Cole1993-zt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cole, M., &amp;amp; Engeström, Y. (1993). A cultural-historical approach to distributed cognition. In G. Salomon (Ed.), Distributed cognitions: Psychological and educational considerations (pp. 1–46). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This is a seminal piece about the activity (system) theory as a cultural-historical view of learning. It touches on several important connections between AT and expansive learning, distributed cognition, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;: I especially like the second example presented in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we have decided to explore approaches to distributed cognition by tracing this line of thinking back to the origins of psychology as a distinct discipline, by relating how it was developed by the cultural-historical school of psychology earlier in this century, and by suggesting the advantages of working within the culturalhistorical framework (informed by modern cognitive psychology, anthropology, and sociology) when studying cognition as a distributed phenomenon. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wundt&amp;rsquo;s version of distributed cognition (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;discussion about the work of Wilhelm Wundt according to the discipline&amp;rsquo;s folklore, the &amp;ldquo;father&amp;rdquo; of scientific psychology (Blumenthal, 1980; Farr, 1987; Toulmin, 1981). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the study of historically accumulated, culturally organized knowledge as revealed in the written accounts of explorers and early anthropologists as well as the analyses provided by philologists and historians (Wundt, 1921). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other half of Wundt&amp;rsquo;s system involved the study of &amp;ldquo;higher psychological functions,&amp;rdquo; including processes of reasoning and the products of human language. Wundt claimed that this second branch of psychology, which he called Völkerpsychologie, could not be studied using laboratory methods focused on the contents of consciousness, because the phenomena being studied extend beyond individual human consciousness. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wundt replied that &amp;ldquo;individual consciousness is wholly incapable of giving us a history of the development of human thought, for it is conditioned by an earlier history concerning which it cannot of itself give us any knowledge&amp;rdquo; (Wundt, 1921, p. 3). In modern terms, Wundt was arguing that while elementary psychological functions may be considered to occur &amp;ldquo;in the head,&amp;rdquo; higher psychological functions require additional cognitive resources that are to be found in the sociocultural milieu. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo Münsterberg (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo Münsterberg, the &amp;ldquo;father of applied psychology,&amp;rdquo; fully adhered to Wundt&amp;rsquo;s dual-psychology distinction and provided one of the earliest systematic statements of the distributed nature of cognition. Münsterberg (1914, p. 16) referred to the experimental half of Wundt&amp;rsquo;s program as &amp;ldquo;causal&amp;rdquo; psychology and the descriptive half as &amp;ldquo;purposive&amp;rdquo; psychology, warning that it was &amp;ldquo;extremely important to keep them cleanly separated and to recognize distinctly the principles which control them.&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Münsterberg (1914) argued that cognition occurs not only &amp;ldquo;in the head,&amp;rdquo; where millions of brain cells interact outside the range of consciousness to &amp;ldquo;remember for us,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;to think for us,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;to will for us,&amp;rdquo; but in the objective elements of communication among individuals: (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History (thus far) has been kinder to the originators of the cultural-historical approach associated with the names of Alexei Leont&amp;rsquo;ev, Alexander Luria, and Lev Vygotsky. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cultural-historical approach (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic ideas of cultural-historical psychology are contained in a series of articles and monographs written in the late 1920s and early 1930s (Leont&amp;rsquo;ev, 1932; Luria, 1928, 1932; Vygotsky, 1929, 1960). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presumed qualitative discontinuity between human and animal development is characterized in a variety of interlocking ways by the initiators of the cultural-historical school. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Luria opens with the well-known assertion that &amp;ldquo;man differs from animals in that he can make and use tools.&amp;rdquo; These tools, he writes, &amp;ldquo;not only radically change his conditions of existence, they even react on him in that they effect a change in him and his psychic condition&amp;rdquo; (Luria, 1928, p. 493). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic structure of human cognition that results from tool mediation has traditionally been pictured as a triangle, as in Figure 1.1. Simplifying for purposes of explication, &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;unmediated&amp;rdquo;) functions are those along the base of the triangle; &amp;ldquo;cultural&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;mediated&amp;rdquo;) functions are those where interactions between subject and object are mediated by an auxiliary means, at the vertex of the triangle. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the overall process of cultural mediation, the &amp;ldquo;tool of tools,&amp;rdquo; and they had a decidedly two-sided notion of tool mediation. As Vygotsky explains in his monograph &amp;ldquo;Tool and Symbol&amp;rdquo; (1978), what we conventionally call tools and what we conventionally call symbols are two aspects of the same phenomenon: Mediation through tools was said to be more outwardly oriented, mediation through signs was more inwardly oriented, toward &amp;ldquo;the self,&amp;rdquo; but both aspects adhered in every cultural artifact. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see clearly that the classical mediational triangle is a description of the basic structural constraints on individual human cognition. But such a static description leaves out the dynamic, double world of which Luria writes. Consequently, we have to add another dimension to this structural picture time in the course of which the two worlds (the directly given and the culturally mediated) are constantly synthesized to provide the mental foundations of people&amp;rsquo;s real-time actions in the world. This expanded version of the basic mediational triangle is shown in Figure 1.2, which emphasizes the fact that cognition requires analysis and synthesis of (at least} two sources of information in real time. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the assumption that other human beings, both those present to the senses and those of prior generations, play a crucial role in the formation of human cognitive capacities. This point is summed up in what Vygotsky (1934/ 1987) called the &amp;ldquo;general law of cultural development&amp;rdquo;: The history of the development of signs brings us, however, to a far more general law that directs the development of behavior. Janet calls it the fundamental law in psychology. The essence of the law is that the child in the process of development begins to apply to himself the very same forms of behavior which others applied to him prior (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to that. The child himself acquires social forms of behavior and transposes those on to himself&amp;hellip;. The sign originally is always a means of social contact, a means of influence upon others, and only subsequendy does it find itself in the role of a means for influencing oneself. (Vygotsky, 1960, p. 192) (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the mediational triangles in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 fail to account for the collective nature of human activities, or activity systems as Leont&amp;rsquo;ev (1978, 1981) called them. In Figure 1.3 we have added certain crucial elements (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated in Figure 1.3, the relations between subject and community are mediated, on the one hand, by the group&amp;rsquo;s full collection of &amp;ldquo;mediating artifacts&amp;rdquo; and, on the other hand, by &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; (the norms and sanctions that specify and regulate the expected correct procedures and acceptable interactions among the participants). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities, in turn, imply a &amp;ldquo;division of labor,&amp;rdquo; the continuously negotiated distribution of tasks, powers, and responsibilities among the participants of the activity system (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it provides a conceptual map to the major loci among which human cognition is distributed. Second, it includes other people who must somehow be taken into account simultaneously with the subject as constituents of human activity systems. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important feature of activity as a basic unit of analysis of human behavior is that when activities become institutionalized, they are rather robust and enduring. Once they gain the status of cultural practices, they often have radically longer half-lives than an individual goal-directed action. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, closer analysis of apparently unchanging activity systems reveals that transitions and reorganizations are constantly going on within and between activity systems as a fundamental part of the dynamics of human evolution. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;activity system is followed through time, qualitative overall transformations may also be found. Institutionalized activity systems seem to move through de elopmental cycles that typically last years (Engestrom, 1987). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can summarize the cultural-historical conception of the basic structure of human activity as follows: 1. The psychological functions shared with our prehuman cousins, socalled natural functions, develop according to principles that are different from psychological functions that are mediated through tools and rules for example, &amp;ldquo;cultural&amp;rdquo; functions. 2. Cultural mediation creates a species-specific, universal structure of human mind and associated morphology of action. 3. Cultural mediation has a recursive, bidirectional effect; mediated activity simultaneously modifies both the environment and the subject. 4. Cultural artifacts are both material and symbolic; they regulate interaction with one&amp;rsquo;s environment and oneself. In this respect, they are &amp;ldquo;tools&amp;rdquo; broadly conceived, and the master tool is language. 5. The cultural environment into which children are born contains the accumulated knowledge of prior generations. In mediating their behavior through these objects, human beings benefit not only from their own experience, but from that of their forebears. 6. Cultural mediation implies a species-specific mode of developmen-tal change in which the accomplishments of prior generations are cumulated in the present as the specifically human part of the environment; culture is, in this sense, history in the present. 7. Cultural mediation implies a special importance of the social world in human development since only other human beings can create the special conditions needed for that development to occur. 8. A natural unit of analysis for the study of human behavior is activity systems, historically conditioned systems of relations among individuals and their proximal , culturally organized environments. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hands ofVygotsky, Luria, and Leont&amp;rsquo;ev, experiments using this method were also considered a specific version of a microgenetic experiment, which provoked the process of psychological change under controlled laboratory conditions.2 A wide variety of studies carried out by Russian cultural-historical psychologists made use of this method. For example, in studies of the development of voluntary behavior in young children, Alexander Luria demonstrated that the acquisition of self-control in simple situations where children were asked to squeeze a rubber bulb or refrain from squeezing was intimately related to the children&amp;rsquo;s ability to mediate their activity through language. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;such studies of the mediational means crucial to the remediation of behavior in cases of injury or disease could permit analysis of the microgenetic processes of everyday thinking. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Vygotsky placed pieces of paper on a level floor and asked the patient to walk across the room stepping over them, the formerly immobile patient was able to walk across the room unaided. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scaffolding&lt;br /&gt;
 scaffolds as tools/mediating artifacts? (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using cultural-historical psychology to think about distribution of mind (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our own view is that several productive expansions of culturalhistorical psychology have grown out of the U.S. and European hybrids of Russian approaches. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distribution ofcognition &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo;theperson (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luria&amp;rsquo;s remediational procedures were based on methods that deliberately redistributed cognition depending on the particular brain deficit afflicting a patient (Luria, 1973). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His point has been made quite markedly by contemporary neuroscientists (e.g., Edelman, 1987) who urge on us the recognition that which parts of the brain are engaged in what way in getting through a particular event depends critically on the cultural constitution of that event. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distribution &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo;themediumculture (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic sense in which cultural mediation implies the distribution of cognition was emphasized by Gregory Bateson, who proposed the following thought experiment: Suppose I am a blind man, and I use a stick. I go tap, tap, tap. Where do I start? Is my mental system bounded at the hand of the stick? Is it bounded by my skin? Does it start halfway up the stick? Does it start at the tip of the stick? (1972, p. 459) Bateson goes on to argue that the answer to the question changes depending on how the event is conceived. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the ways in which mind is distributed depend crucially on the tools through which one interacts with the world, and these in turn depend on one&amp;rsquo;s goals. The combination of goals, tools, and setting (or perhaps &amp;ldquo;arena,&amp;rdquo; in Lave&amp;rsquo;s, 1988, terminology) constitutes simultaneously the context of behavior and the ways in which cognition can be said to be distributed in that context. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion that mediation of activity through artifacts implies a distribution of cognition among individual, mediator, and environment, as well as the fundamental change wrought by artifactmediated activity, is eloquently expressed by two otherwise very different anthropologists, Leslie White and Clifford Geertz. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White (1942) wrote: Man differs from the apes, and indeed all other living creatures so far as we know, in that he is capable of symbolic behavior. With words man creates a new world, a world of ideas and philosophies. In this world man lives just as truly as in the physical world of his senses&amp;hellip;.This world comes to have a continuity and a permanence that the external world of the senses can never have. It is not made up of present only but of a past and a future as well. Temporally, it is not a succession of disconnected episodes, but a continuum extending to infinity in both directions, from eternity to eternity. (p. 372) (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cultural-historical psychologists (e.g., Vygotsky, &lt;sup&gt;1934&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1987&lt;/sub&gt;) emphasize that, as mediators of human action, all artifacts can be considered tools and symbols. As White (1959) expressed the relationship: An axe has a subjective component; it would be meaningless without a concept and an attitude. On the other hand, a concept or attitude would be meaningless without overt expression, in behavior or speech (which is a form of behavior). Every cultural element, every cultural trait, therefore, has a subjective and an objective aspect. (p. 236) (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patterning of culturally distributed cognition (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that culture is patterned, but there is also no doubt that it is far from uniform, because it is experienced in local, face-to-face interactions that are locally constrained and, hence, heterogeneous with respect to both &amp;ldquo;culture as a whole&amp;rdquo; and the parts of the entire cultural toolkit experienced by any given individual. This point has been emphasized by Ted Schwartz (1978, 1990), who explores the way in which knowledge is distributed differentially across persons, generations, occupations, classes, religions, institutions, and so on. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distributed notion of culture also requires one to think about how cognition is distributed among people by virtue of their social roles (which, again, are both phylogenetically and culturally constrained). As Fussell and Krauss (1989) clearly demonstrate, part of one&amp;rsquo;s cultural knowledge is knowledge about the extent to which others are likely to share one&amp;rsquo;s knowledge and cognitive perspective. Hence, the social distribution of cognition both adds to, and subtracts from, the degree of common culture mediating any particular interaction. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geertz (1973) proposed that &amp;ldquo;culture is best seen not as complexes of concrete behavior patterns customs, usages, traditions, habit clusters &amp;hellip;but as a set of control mechanisms plans, recipes, rules, instructions (what computer engineers call &amp;lsquo;programs&amp;rsquo;)for governing behavior&amp;rdquo; (p. 44). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In D&amp;rsquo;Andrade&amp;rsquo;s (1984) terms: Typically such schemas portray simplified worlds, making the appropriateness of the terms that are based on them dependent on the degree to which these schemas fit the actual worlds of the objects being categorized. Such schemas portray not only the world of physical objects and events, but also more abstract worlds of social interaction, discourse, and even word meaning. (p. 93, original in italics) (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&amp;rsquo;Andrade&amp;rsquo;s approach, like Geertz&amp;rsquo;s, might be read as locating culture (and cognition) inside the head. However, D&amp;rsquo;Andrade (1986, p. 22), like Geertz, makes it quite clear that objects should be considered &amp;ldquo;reified ideas in a solid medium&amp;rdquo;; that is, objects are suffused with conceptual content. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&amp;rsquo;Andrade concludes that &amp;ldquo;what might at first look like a simple device in fact turns out to be a complex of mediations that is, of coordinations between structures&amp;rdquo; (p. 107). (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of cognition in the social world (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, constituents of the blind man&amp;rsquo;s cognitive processing are to be located both in the immediate setting (distributed to each of the nodes in the expanded triangle in Figure 1.3) and in the upcoming activity, which is presupposed in all of his actions. Within each local setting, such &amp;ldquo;cognitive actions&amp;rdquo; as remembering and decision making are distributed not only among the artifacts (the menu, the (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;arrangement of chairs and tables, the sign pointing to the restrooms) but among the rules (one pays before leaving the premises; sitting down at a table with strangers requires one to ask permission) and among people according to the division of labor (waiters fulfill different parts of the activity at the cafe than the customers or the dishwasher; the janitor must remember to put away the mop and bucket; the owner is responsible for paying the janitor and waiter). It is such considerations that motivated Douglas (1987) to write a book about &amp;ldquo;how institutions think&amp;rdquo; and Connerton (1989) a book about &amp;ldquo;how societies remember.&amp;rdquo; (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of mind in time (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this information derived from their cultural past and assuming that the world will be very much for their daughter as it has been for them, the parents project a probable future for the child. (She will be sought after by males as a sexual partner, causing the parents anxiety. She will not participate in a form of activity [rugby] requiring strength and agility that is the special preserve of males.) (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different ways in which temporality enters into the distribution of cognition in time illustrated by Macfarlane&amp;rsquo;s example are represented in Figure 1.4. Figure 1.4a presents five time lines, the bottom four of which correspond to the four &amp;ldquo;developmental domains&amp;rdquo; (Wertsch, 1985) that, according to the cultural-historical framework espoused here, simultaneously serve as major constraints on, and resources for, human development. At the top of Figure 1.4a is what might be called &amp;ldquo;physical time,&amp;rdquo; or the history of the physical universe that long precedes the appearance of life on earth. The second line represents phylogenetic time, the history of life on earth. The third represents cultural-historical time, which has co-evolved with phylogenetic time. The fourth line represents ontogeny, the history of a single human being, and the fifth line represents microgenesis, the moment-to-moment time of lived human experience. The ellipse running vertically through the figure is the event under analysis, the birth of a baby girl. The four horizontal lines correspond to four kinds of genesis, four temporal scales: phylogenesis, culturogenesis, ontogenesis, and microgenesis, each &amp;ldquo;lower&amp;rdquo; level embedded in the level &amp;ldquo;above it.&amp;rdquo; (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, cognition is distributed both &amp;ldquo;vertically&amp;rdquo; in the different time dimensions occupied by each of the participants and &amp;ldquo;horizontally&amp;rdquo; with respect to past, present, and future. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example also helps us to illustrate another feature attributed to culturally mediated thought: the process by which the &amp;ldquo;ideational&amp;rdquo; side of all cultural artifacts is transformed into its &amp;ldquo;material&amp;rdquo; side. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As copious research has demonstrated, even adults totally ignorant of the real gender of a newborn will treat the baby quite differently depending on its symbolic/cultural &amp;ldquo;gender.&amp;rdquo; (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) Another line, the ontogeny of the child, has been added to that of the individual. The distribution of cognition in time is traced sequentially into (1) the past of the mother, (2) the mother&amp;rsquo;s imagination of the future of the child, and (3) the subsequent behavior of the mother. In this same sequence, the ideal aspect of culture is transformed into its material form as the mother and other adults structure the child&amp;rsquo;s experience consistent with their (imagined) future identity (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two research programs: applying cultural-historical ideas in practice (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each example highlights a somewhat different mix of the distributive properties we have summarized. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading acquisition (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that part of the problem in contemporary research on reading is that the psychological models of reading acquisition fail to take account of the distributed properties of cognition. In particular, they are especially weak in their conception of learning to read as joint, mediated, meaning-making activity between teachers and students in which the distribution of cognitive work must be systematically transformed. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implicitly, this sort of model assumes reading to be a solitary activity occurring inside the head of the learner; the fact that learning is part of a larger, joint activity, called instruction, is not acknowledged. In reality, with very few exceptions, acquiring the ability to read is most decidedly not an individual process, and we have a pretty good idea of where Zeus&amp;rsquo;s arrow is coming from the teacher, the bearer of the cultural past, the bearer of authority concerning the correct interpretation of the text, the organizer of the teaching/learning process. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;two principles present themselves as relevant: 1. The cognitive processing involved in learning to read is not an individual matter; the requisite cognitive processes are distributed among teacher, pupil, other students, and the cultural artifacts around which they coordinate in the activity called &amp;ldquo;teaching/ learning” to read. 2. The expected future state, mature reading, must somehow be present at the beginning of instruction as constraints enabling the development of the to-be-acquired new system of mediation, mature reading. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.5. The to-be-coordinated systems of mediation that exist when a novice begins to learn to read from an expert. (A} The child C can mediate interactions with the world W via an adult A. (B) The adult can mediate interactions with the world via text. &amp;copy; The child-text-adult relationship is the goal of instruction. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructional/developmental task is now better specified: We must somehow create a system of interpersonal interaction such that the combined child-adult system at the right of Figure 1.6 cans coordinate the child&amp;rsquo;s act of reading before the child can accomplish this activity for himor herself. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating the activity. Having identified the skeletal structural relations that must be coordinated at the level of teacher-student-test relations, we now need to figure out the system of activity that will achieve the needed coordination’s. Our strategy for accomplishing this goal was to create an artificial activity system including a script, props, and roles. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key mediational tools of the procedure are a text, a publicly visible script for the joint activity written on a blackboard, a set of roles (each corresponding to a different hypothetical part of the whole act of reading reified in a set of role cards printed on 3-in. X 5-in. index cards), and rules for conducting the activity we called &amp;ldquo;Question-AskingReading. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect the resulting procedure to the preceding and following discussion, Figure 1.7 represents the triangular structure of activity presented earlier in Figure 1.3 with the specific tools, object, community, division of labor, and social rules appropriate to the activity under construction. Figure 1.7 also specifies how we conceive of the distribution of cognition in the Question-Asking-Reading activity. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of greatest interest in the present context is the way in which this system allowed us to trace the microgenesis of reading acquisition. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a relatively steady state of coordination around the artifacts and goals of Question-Asking-Reading was achieved, it became apparent that different children discoordinated with the routine in systematically different patterns. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the in situ data, our ability to detect selective discoordinations in a joint, mediated activity served as powerful testimony to the efficacy of our approach to reading acquisition. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having focused on the process of our system of reading instruction, we failed to address adequately the relative quality of the product. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King found that both Question-Asking-Reading and her version of the procedural facilitation technique boosted the children&amp;rsquo;s reading performance. However, children in the Question-Asking-Reading group retained significantly more material from the training passages than did the students in the procedural facilitation group. The students in the Question-Asking-Reading group also spent more total time actively engaged with the task and demonstrated a greater (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;interest in the content of the readings, indicating an intimate link between the motivational, social-interactional, and cognitive aspects of activity-in-context. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expertisein transition (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second example is taken from a longitudinal research project studying the reorganization of medical work in a Finnish health center that provides primary health-care services to the population of a middle-sized city (see Engestrom, 1990, in press) (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such transformation is essentially an expansive learning process (Engestrom, 1987) in which the practitioners acquire a new way of working while designing and implementing the new practices themselves. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A workplace is not a homogeneous activity system. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a historical dimension to be observed. Competing schools of thought and practice originate in different historical periods and conditions. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;alternative frames of reference may be analyzed as if they are historical layers of expertise, to be identified by an &amp;ldquo;archaeology of expert knowledge.&amp;rdquo; Competing and contradictory historical layers of expertise can regularly be discovered within one and the same organization (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we conducted an extensive interview with each of the 16 physicians of two health stations in a single health center. The interview contained, among other themes, a cluster of questions concerning the physician&amp;rsquo;s conception of the object of his or her work. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the interview protocols resulted in a classification of the physicians&amp;rsquo; frames of reference concerning the object of their work (Table 1.1). The five frames of reference found among the physicians of this organization correspond to five historically distinct and culturally deep-seated theoretical patterns of thinking about illness (see, e.g., Arney &amp;amp; Bergen, 1984; Shorter, 1985). (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to conducting interviews, we videotaped five or six randomly chosen patient consultations with each of the doctors. Analyses of the videotapes support the conclusion that these distinct frames of reference are in fact connected to different practical procedures or &amp;ldquo;scripts&amp;rdquo; for dealing with patients in practice ( Engestrom, 1989). (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of diversity or multivoicedness is an important feature of the distribution of cognition in expert work. Potentially it is a rich source of resources, making the activity system capable of combining different viewpoints and skills in the handling of complex problems. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the potential advantages of multivoicedness were all but impossible to tap (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor-patient relationships were dominated by anonymity and discontinuity. These facts, together with strong production pressures, created an atmosphere of deepening crisis in the activity system. The physicians had little time or incentive to stop and reflect on the problem of complex patients, let alone to discuss them jointly. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the fact that the doctor has never seen the patient before and that she hasn&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to discuss the patient with her colleagues, the computerized record functions here in a remarkable manner as a diagnostic aid, providing a bridge between the past recorded by others and the present faced by the first-timer. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this doctor takes an approach that is very different from the previous one. Instead of studying the record to make a hypothesis based on the patient&amp;rsquo;s history, the doctor acts on the basis of the patient&amp;rsquo;s explicit statements and physical examination. In the postconsultation interview, she justifies her approach by referring to the acute nature of the case. She states that had the patient had a similar problem previously, she would have suspected anxiety or related mental reasons. But since the patient denied having similar lung or chest problems before, she went ahead on a purely biomedical basis. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two consultations happened as if with two different patients. Ostensibly this break occurred because the second doctor did not check the patient&amp;rsquo;s previous records. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the patient used many healthcare services by drifting from one doctor to another and from one variation of symptoms to another. He thus contributed to the production pressure felt by practitioners in the activity system. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first contradiction was that between the complexity of the patient&amp;rsquo;s problems and the arbitrary distribution of patients to physicians, each compartmentalized and effectively separated from the others. The second contradiction was that between the demand for quality care for complex problems and the rule requiring speedy consultations, especially in the category of acute consultations without an appointment. The ensuing production pressure reinforced a compartmentalized approach on the doctor&amp;rsquo;s part. The third contradiction was that between complex patient problems and rather traditional tools of biomedical diagnosis. In such conditions, the medical record easily served as only a minimal administrative device. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compartmentalized and alienated approach to health care, reinforced by drifting on the patients&amp;rsquo; part, eventually contributed to increased production pressure. A vicious circle was thus established, The researcher&amp;rsquo;s task was to provide data (such as the videotapes and interview transcripts of the case discussed earlier) and conceptual (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tools (such as the models in Figures 1.3 and 1.9) that enabled the practitioners to break the vicious circle by realizing how their division of labor reinforced and perpetuated the production pressure and alienation they felt. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key feature of this new model is a new division of labor that radically alters the conditions for exploiting the distributed cognitive resources of the system (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an expansive cycle (Engestrom, 1987, 1991). An expansive cycle is a developmental process that involves both the internalization of a given culture of practice and the creation of novel artifacts and patterns of interaction. The new activity structure does not emerge out of the blue. It requires reflective analysis of the existing activity structure participants must learn to know and understand what they want to transcend. And the creation of a new activity system requires the reflective appropriation of advanced models and tools that offer ways out of the internal contradictions. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the level of collective activity systems, such an expansive cycle can be seen as the equivalent of traveling through the zone of proximal development discussed by Vygotsky (1978) at the level of individual and small-group learning. A key feature of expansive cycles is that they are definitely not predetermined courses of onedimensional development. What is more advanced, &amp;ldquo;which way is up,&amp;rdquo; cannot be decided using externally given, fixed yardsticks. Decisions of that kind are made locally, within the activity system itself, under conditions of uncertainty and intensive search. Yet they are not arbitrary decisions. The internal contradictions of the activity system in a given phase of its evolution can be more or less adequately identified, and any model for the future that does not address and solve those contradictions will eventually turn out to be nonexpansive. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;important&lt;br /&gt;
 important connections made here about expansive learning, ZPD, learning across levels, social regulation, etc. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expertise can be understood as a system of cognition, distributed as an activity system. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from compartmentalized expertise to team-based expertise was essentially a process of redistribution of cognition based on design from below. It can be assumed that such a design will be incorporated into the new team-based type of expert practice as a novel cognitive resource. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, when one takes mediation through artifacts as the central distinctive characteristic of human beings, one is declaring ones adoption of the view that human cognition is distributed. Precisely how cognition is distributed must be worked out for different kinds of activity, with their different forms of mediation, division of labor, social rules, and so on. The underlying principles, however, are universal. In aggregate they constitute a cultural theory of mind. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nice&lt;br /&gt;
 nice summary of the examples presented in this article (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the current burst of ·interest in distributed cognition? In the most general terms, it is because of the widespread belief that the positivistically oriented social sciences, with their notion of cognition firmly located inside the individual, are inadequate (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we have a far more sophisticated technology for representing complex, temporally extended behavior than did researchers at the end of the century. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

(2014). “Learning in an introductory physics MOOC: All cohorts learn
equally, including an on-campus class.” &lt;em&gt;The International Review of

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We studied student learning in the MOOC 8.MReV Mechanics ReView, run on the edX.org open source platform. We studied learning in two ways. We administered 13 conceptual questions both before and after instruction, analyzing the results using standard techniques for pre­ and posttesting. We also analyzed each week’s homework and test questions in the MOOC, including the pre­ and posttests, using item response theory (IRT). This determined both an average ability and a relative improvement in ability over the course. The pre­ and posttesting showed substantial learning: The students had a normalized gain slightly higher than typical values for a traditional course, but significantly lower than typical values for courses using interactive engagement pedagogy. Importantly, both the normalized gain and the IRT analysis of pre­ and posttests showed that learning was the same for different cohorts selected on various criteria: level of education, preparation in math and physics, and overall ability in the course. We found a small positive correlation between relative improvement and prior educational attainment. We also compared homework performance of MIT freshmen taking a reformed on­campus course with the 8.MReV students, finding them to be considerably less skillful than the 8.MReV students. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary and Conclusions (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have studied conceptual learning in a MOOC by analyzing the results of pre­ and posttesting in two ways: normalized gain and item response theory (IRT). Both methods show unequivocal evidence of learning. The amount of learning, normalized gain, 0.31 +/­ 0.02, was higher than in any of the 14 traditional (i.e., lecture­based) courses studied by Hake 1998, but was in the lowest decile of courses whose classes included “interactive engagement” activities. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed we have made a preliminary investigation (Champaign et al., 2014) finding significant positive correlations with time spent on several different resources, but with little differentiation between them. A second factor that might affect learning is study patterns; for example, we found dramatically different patterns of resource use when students did homework versus exams (Seaton, Bergner, Chuang, Mitros, &amp;amp; Pritchard, 2014). This raises the question of whether students following these (or other) patterns will show more or less learning. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the different demographics of those registering, the different objectives of each course, and the significantly smaller percentage of certificate earners in these other MOOCs, direct comparisons will be challenging. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Stahl (2006) group cognition requires a theory of collaboration that takes the group as the unit of analysis rather than the individual. ‘Learning by groups’ is not the same as ‘learning in groups’ or individual learning through social processes. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.1. Community knowledge (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the nature of group or community knowledge, it is important to distinguish between a psychological concept of knowledge as something within an individual mind and a social concept of knowledge as conceptual artifacts that have a public life (Bereiter, 2002; Bereiter &amp;amp; Scardamalia, 1996; Hyman, 1999; Popper, 1972). Community knowledge is public knowledged ideas made accessible to all community members through contributions to collective knowledge spaces. Thus ideas have a life beyond the individual mind and can be continually accessed and improveddmuch as is the case with publication in journals. Community knowledge involves a dynamic processd interactions between ideas and people knowledge (i.e., knowing people’s expertise)dwith participants monitoring who is working on what ideas or problems and advancing knowledge in the community (Hong &amp;amp; Lin-Siegler, 2012). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2. Assessing community knowledge (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its time-consuming nature, a common way to assess group or community knowledge is to assess group products (Bourner, Hughes, &amp;amp; Bourner, 2001; Cheng &amp;amp; Warren, 2000; Lee, Chan, &amp;amp; van Aalst, 2006; Lejk &amp;amp; Wyvill, 2001). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commonly used unit of content analysis has been theme. Themes can be either pre-speci&amp;rdquo;ed based on an existing protocol or emergent from an open-coding process (Strauss &amp;amp; Corbin, 1990). But either way, there is an issue of subjectivity of theme selection. Second, content analysis has been used more often by researchers as a research tool than by users as an interaction/learning tool for assessing content in a database. Particularly for teachers (and students as well), it is a dif&amp;rdquo;cult and time-consuming technique to apply, thus limiting its use and usefulness for advancing the state of community knowledge. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore possibilities of using key-term measures: (1) to help assess and visually represent both personal and community knowledge, and (2) to complement (not replace) traditional online behavioral measures, in order to better capture knowledge building dynamics. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4. Proposed key-term measures (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 summarizes all key measures employed in this study and the statistics used to compare between the two datasets by using the conventional and new measures. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. Comparisons using conventional online behavioral measures (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, in the second phase there was (1) less time spent on problem generation and connectivity (i.e., note-linking and building-on), and (2) more time on elaborating the content of each note (e.g., more note revisions and more words per note). This suggests a change from more breadth-oriented inquiry in phase 1 to more re!ective, depthoriented inquiry in phase 2. This con&amp;rdquo;rms &amp;ldquo;ndings from the previous study mentioned above (Hong et al., 2008). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the standard deviations seemed rather high (e.g., the number of note revisions). This may be because knowledge building highlights student autonomy, whereas traditional didactic teaching tends to maintain a relatively equal learning agenda and pace for a group of students. Therefore, it is possible that variations in performance re!ect greater diversity in the activities engaged in by knowledge builders. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. Comparisons using alternative key-term measures (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, in terms of unique key terms when comparing the mean number of key terms each student contributed between the two phases, it was found that there was no signi&amp;rdquo;cant difference (t &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 2.065, df &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 21, P &amp;gt; .05). On average, each student generated 40.10 key terms (SD &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 17.74) in phase 1 and 33.27 key terms (SD &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 11.35) in phase 2 (see Table 3). However, when comparing the mean frequency of key-term use by each student between the two phases, there was signi&amp;rdquo;cant difference (t &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 2.483, df &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 21, P &amp;lt; .05) in that the mean frequency of key-term use is 78.41 (SD &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 38.74) in phase 1 and 100.14 (SD &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 40.11) in phase 2. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, similarities between the conventional and key-term measures showed the following important patterns: First, both types of measures can be used for automated assessment. Second, both can be easily integrated into online learning environments. Third, both are easy to implement, and with careful instructiona (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that after continuously solving many problems in their area of expertise, expert learners (or teams of expert learners) possess a stronger sense of which ideas are more promising to pursue in &amp;ldquo;nding a solution to a problem, and/or of how to improve, re&amp;rdquo;ne, or redesign the problem space (e.g., Schwartz &amp;amp; Martin, 2004). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has seemed to us that a promising approach to school restructuring
would start by examining how schools (including the high-achieving ones)
limit knowledge-building potential. By addressing fundamental shortcom-
ings, we may find it possible to do more than struggle to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;informal knowledge that has been found to characterize expert competence.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;informal knowledge that has been found to characterize expert competence.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;informal knowledge that has been found to characterize expert competence.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;rize expert competence.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;::Knowledge-building
discourse is  at the heart of the superior education that  we have in mind. We
argue that  the classroom needs to foster transformational thought,  on the part
of both students and  teachers, and that  the best way to do this is to replace
classroom-bred  discourse  patterns  with  those having more immediate and
natural extensions to  the real world, patterns  whereby ideas  are conceived,
responded to, reframed, and set in historical  context.::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competitive
sports and businesses are examples  of second-order  environments,  in which
the accomplishments  of participants keep  raising the  standard that the others
strive  for. ::More relevant examples  in education are the sciences  and other
learned  disciplines  in  which  adaptation  involves  making  contributions  to
collective  knowledge.  Because  this  very activity  increases  the  collective
knowledge,  continued adaptation requires contributions  beyond what is al
ready known, thus producing nonasymptotic learning.::  The idea of schools as
knowledge-building  communities  is the idea of making them into second
order environments  on this model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice  it to say that any hope for technology to have a  role in
restructuring  education  must  take  the  form  of searching  for a third way
something that  is neither  didactic,  activity-centered,  nor a mere compromise
between the two (which is what already  exists  in most schools).
In  searching  for a third  viable form  of schooling,  educational  thinkers
have looked outside the school for models; thus, traditional  apprenticeship
has been examined as a possible model,  one that provides for a natural but
highly  goal-oriented  kind  of learning (Collins, Brown,  &amp;amp; Newman, 1989).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;dependent on &amp;ldquo;the occasional genius, or the occasional lucky thought.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;occasional lucky thought.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;::More significant implications follow if the question is reformulated at the
level of the group rather than the individual: Can a classroom function as a
knowledge-building community, similar to the knowledge-building commu-
nities that set the pace for their fields?::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further implication is that creating new knowledge and learning existing knowledge are not
very different as far as psychological processes are concerned. There is no
patent reason that schooling cannot have the dynamic character of scientific
knowledge building. If there are insurmountable obstacles, they are more
likely to be of a social or attitudinal than of a cognitive kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;structure.::&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;structure.::&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;structure.::&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;structure.::&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;structure.::&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;structure.::&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;structure.::&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;structure.::&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;::Our focusing on journal publication may seem like a case of mistaking the
wrapper for the candy bar.:: What about research? What about curiosity? We
do not mean to slight either of these. Surely, scholarly disciplines would not
exist without them. However, these have received ample consideration in
previous thinking about school learning. Neglected until recently have been
(a) the role of discourse and (b) the role of motives other than purely
epistemic ones. Decades ago, Popper (1962) recognized argument and criti-
cism as the driving forces in the advancement of scientific knowledge, with
research having its impact through these discourse processes. Only in the last
few years has talking science (Lemke, 1990) begun to be recognized as a
necessary adjunct to hands-on investigation in school science. The use of
inquiry methods in schools has been based on a frequently disappointed
confidence in the power of children&amp;rsquo;s natural curiosity. ::The study of schol-
arly discourse, as embodied in the journal process, shows us how a wide
range of human motives (including curiosity, of course) is marshaled in the
actual progress of knowledge construction in the disciplines.::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does one characterize knowledge-building discourse and then recreate
classroom activity to support it? We could imitate at the surface level-for
instance, by having classes produce scholarly journals with peer review. In
fact, the CSILE implementation we describe later has provisions for doing
that, but it is not likely that imitation of surface forms can produce the
radical restructuring necessary to turn schools into real knowledge-building
communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;communities.::&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Maximizing the interplay and value of different communication modes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Increased and diversified response to ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two examples&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluations of CSILE to date indicate that CSILE students greatly surpass
students in ordinary classrooms on measures of depth of learning and reflec-
tion, awareness of what they have learned or need to learn, and understand-
ing of learning itself. Moreover, individual achievement, as conventionally
measured, does not suffer. In fact, students do better on standardized tests in
reading, language, and vocabulary (Scardamalia et al., 1992). What most
impresses teachers and observers alike, however, is what the students are
able to do collectively. As the preceding examples suggest, they seem to be
functioning beyond their years, tackling problems and constructing knowl-
edge at levels that one simply does not find in ordinary schools, regardless
of the calibre of students they enroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not want to suggest that the technology by itself can bring about
the transformation of a school into a knowledge-building community. We
already have evidence that teacher strategies can make a major difference in
the extent to which students engage in collaborative knowledge building
(Bereiter &amp;amp; Scardamalia, in press). Neither do we want to claim that a
knowledge-building community, meeting the specifications set out pre-
viously, has actually been realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: Fascinating work on &lt;em&gt;multidimensional networks&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;multi-mode, multi-plex, dynamic networks (akin to Carley&amp;rsquo;s dynamic network analysis). This paper starts by talking about sociomateriality&amp;mdash;arguing that tech and human are inseparable, so they should be kept in a same network. It then introduces a typology capturing a spectrum of networks starting from unidimensional (traditional) social networks and moving towards fully multidimensional networks. It presents an interesting empirical case (first analyzed using ethnographic approaches), and move onto discuss &lt;em&gt;structuring signatures&lt;/em&gt; and use of ERGM/p* to test theories of multidimensional networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: This line of work shares similar motivations with DNA. A bit surprising they do not reference each other. This work is quite mind-opening for my ongoing work on KB discourse. Many ideas emerged from reading this article. Key ones include: discourse as a multidimensional networks; looking into sociology theories and their structural signatures that are applicable to CSCL; applying ERGM to test theories about CSCL (at both macro and micro levels, about both static and dynamic networks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article explores the theoretical implications of developing multidimensional social networks that include nonhuman technological elements. Using ideas from actor- network theory and sociomateriality, we develop a typology for multidimensional networks that includes multiple kinds of nodes and multiple kinds of relations. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;exploration of how to develop multidimensional, multitheoretical, and multilevel models that include technological artifacts and relations. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late 20th century, researchers had accrued a good deal of empirical evidence to support hypotheses made in the 1950s and 1960s about the various ways that new technologies would alter social dynamics. Within formal organizational settings, for example, research by Barley (1990), Burkhardt and Brass (1990), Contractor and Seibold (1993), and others demonstrated the subtle, nuanced ways through which newly implemented computer-based technologies alter the flow of communication within networks and, hence, allow people to reconfigure formal organizational structures, decision making, and power relationships. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, scholars became interested in reversing the causal arrow, asking whether established networks could influence the effects of newly implemented technologies. A number of researchers showed, convincingly, that network dynamics could, indeed, shape what people thought about a new technology, as well as whether and how they would use it (Fulk, 1993; Karahanna, Straub, &amp;amp; Chervany, 1999; Kraut, Rice, Cool, &amp;amp; Fish, 1998; Rice &amp;amp; Aydin, 1991). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three sets of studies share the ontological position that technologies exist separately from people’s social networks. In other words, they treat either technologies or networks as exogenous forces that impinge upon the functioning of the other. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is getting really interesting. So signs embodies culture. And humans are essentially inseparable from tech. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such situations , identifying what technology “causes” a particular network change becomes less intellectually interesting, because a given technology is often used interdependently with a wide swath of other pervasive and embedded technologies (Bailey, Leonardi, &amp;amp; Chong, 2010). Similarly, as technologies begin to store greater amounts of information that were once only held in the heads of people, individuals begin to “use” technologies in much the same ways that they “use” coworkers and friends (Su, Huang, &amp;amp; Contractor, 2010). These technologies are emerging as “social prosthetic systems” (Kosslyn, 2011, p. 182). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, ubiquitous computing, both inside and outside formal organizations, is making it increasingly difficult to separate people’s interactions with other people from people’s interactions with technologies. Consequently, it may make more sense to begin treating technologies as endogenous to social networks, rather than as exogenous to them. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of asking how technologies might change social networks (or vice versa, or both), the more appropriate question is, “What happens when a new technology becomes a part of a social network?” (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This move implies that researchers can no longer make an analytic distinction between technologies (or artifacts more generally) and people. They must begin to recognize that networks can be comprised of people and technologies, and that both types of nodes may, on occasion, play equivalent roles. Recently, proponents of a sociomaterial approach to studies of technology and communication have begun to provide us with the ontological foundations and theoretical language with which to make this conceptual shift (e.g., Leonardi &amp;amp; Barley, 2008; Orlikowski, 2007; Orlikowski &amp;amp; Scott, 2008; Pentland &amp;amp; Feldman, 2007). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;same argument could be made for the context of CSCL. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an ontological level, a sociomaterial approach to technology and communication suggests that communicative behaviors and technologies are indistinguishable phenomena (Baptista, 2009; Orlikowski &amp;amp; Scott, 2008). As Leonardi suggests: “technologies are as much social as they are material (in the sense that material features were chosen and retained through social interaction) and [communication patterns] are as much material as they are social (in the sense that social interactions are enabled and constrained by material properties)” (2009a, p. 299). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a sociomaterial approach: &amp;hellip; asserts that materiality is integral to organizing, positing that the social and the material are constitutively entangled in everyday life. A position of constitutive entanglement does not privilege either humans or technology (in one-way interactions), nor does it link them through a form of mutual reciprocation (in two-way interactions). Instead, the social and the material are considered to be inextricably related—there is no social that is not also material, and no material that is not also social. (2007, p. 1,437) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sociomaterial approach draws heavily on the work of actor-network theory (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987; Law, 1987) to stake this ontological claim of symmetry between human action and the actions of technology. Actor-network theory assumes the communicative actions that most social scientists would call “social” involve both people and technologies, and that the material features of a technology are developed and used in a system of social relationships. By abandoning the attempt to distinguish that which is social from that which is material, actor-network theorists consider the actions of humans and non-humans as part of a single network that is, itself, an actor, an “actor-network.” (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the sociomaterial approach is appealing at the ontological level, it is somewhat problematic at the empirical level, because technologies and communication patterns are relatively easy to distinguish (Edmondson, Bohmer, &amp;amp; Pisano, 2001; Pentland &amp;amp; Feldman, 2008). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, although the so ciomaterial approach provides an important way of thinking about technologies as parts of networks (as opposed to entities that exist independent of networks), this approach does not provide much guidance in specifying how researchers might depict sociomaterial relations empirically in ways that recognize these important differences. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we argue that making technologies endogenous to networks will offer researchers the ability to begin thinking about networks composed of different types of nodes (e.g., persons, databases, books, etc.), and about where the relationships among these varying nodes also differ (e.g., one might have a friendship relationship with another person, but an information-retrieval relationship with a database). We call these “multidimensional networks.” This approach stands in contrast to the more traditional approaches, outlined above, which treat networks and technologies as objects that exist separately. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, any non-human actor, no matter whether it is a policy, a routine, a chemical, or a drug, can be brought, conceptually, inside a social network, just like a technology. In so doing, the resultant network ceases to be a simple social network, and it should, instead, be considered a multidimensional network. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptualizing Multidimensional Networks (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unidimensionality is a significant oversimplification of the rich complexity that exists in most social networks. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in most instances, any single study typically looks at networks comprised of only one type of node and, at most, a handful of relations among these similar objects. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unidimensional Networks (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unidimensional networks, sometimes called unimodal, uniplex networks, consist of a single type of object or node and a single type of relation. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing inherently wrong with unidimensional networks. Decades of work in the social sciences has revealed considerable information about how they operate (Easley &amp;amp; Kleinberg, 2010; Jackson, 2008; Monge &amp;amp; Contractor, 2003; Newman, 2010). But they do have a number of limitations. Perhaps most serious is the fact that they oversimplify reality. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unimodal Multiplex Networks (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unimodal multiplex networks contain two or more kinds of relations on a single type of node. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee and Monge were able to examine how structural patterns in one network influenced structural patterns in the other network. A representative finding here was that “organizations with repeated collaboration in implementation networks are likely to have ties in knowledge-sharing projects as well.” (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multimodal Uniplex Networks (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multimodal networks contain two or more different kinds of nodes. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also be represented as a bimodal (or bipartite) matrix, where the two types of nodes are included into a single matrix with rows being the women and columns being the social events or vice versa. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multidimensional Networks (Multimodal Multiplex) (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multidimensional networks have both multiple nodes and multiple relations, and thus, they are sometimes called multimodal multiplex networks. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarly research on multidimensional networks is rare. One notable exception is the research on the evolution of the biotechnology industry by Powell, White, Koput, and Owen-Smith (2005). Their research examines six different sets of nodes (heximodal) and four different relations (quadriplex). The six types of nodes are dedicated biotechnology firms (DBFs), universities and other research and development firms, government regulators, pharmaceutical companies, venture capitalists, and others. The relations were research and development, finance, commercialization, and licensing. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between Two (or more) Types of Nodes (Objects). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, their omission reflects a limitation of traditional network analytic methods that were used to study bimodal networks. These methods typically required that relations only exist between different types of nodes (or modes) and not include relations among similar types of nodes. But most empirical contexts involving multidimensional networks would greatly benefit from the ability to depict ties among the same types of nodes. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent methodological developments (Robins &amp;amp; Wang, 2011) address the limitations indicated above that had restricted analysis only to relations between different types of nodes and highlight the potential for simultaneously analyzing networks where relations can also exist among nodes of the same type. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multidimensional networks: Micro and macro variations. Historically, communication and other social networks have been examined from a static, single-point-in-time, cross-sectional perspective. In fact, each type of network described in this typology can be studied from a dynamic perspective (Breiger, Carley, &amp;amp; Pattison, 2003). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kivran-Swaine, Govindan, and Naaman (2011) show how network structure—strength of ties, embeddedness and status—influenced when people dissolved ties with others on Twitter by “unfollowing” them. Powell et al.’s work, mentioned above, looked at two-mode networks to see how different types of firms (e.g., DBFs and pharmaceutical firms) changed in link structure over time. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all interesting studies (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When network scholars have thought about network dynamics, they have tended to focus on the micro level. Research shows that networks grow by adding individual nodes, or links, or both, and that they decline the same way, by losing nodes, or links, or both. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, rather than focus on individual nodes and links, we can focus on entire modes of objects and types of relations. In this macro approach, we can make networks grow or shrink by adding or omitting an entire mode of objects or an entire type of relation. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, we could allow networks to grow by adding new types of relations, such as “provides directions to.” (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microlevel multidimensional network dynamics. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Th e types of nodes and the types of relations have not changed from Time 1 to Time 2. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macrolevel multidimensional network dynamics. Figure 7 provides an example of a dynamic macrolevel multidimensional network. Here, a new mode (or type) of object, avatars, has been added to the network at Time 2. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is interesting. consider the enter of a drawing in KF discourse? (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, unimodal networks comprise nodes that are all of the same type, while multimodal networks have nodes of different types. Likewise, uniplex networks are comprised of only one type of relationship among the nodes, while a multiplex network includes multiple types of relationships. A multidimensional network is one that is both multimodal and multiplex. Further, dynamic microlevel multidimensional networks are those where nodes or relations of existing types are added or eliminated over time. Dynamic macrolevel multidimensional networks are those where entire classes (or types) of nodes and relations might appear or disappear over time. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ll seven cases in this typology can be studied as dynamic, rather than static, networks. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1. A Framework for Multidimensional Networks. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empirical Example: How Multidimensional Networks Aid in the Explanation of Sociomaterial Dynamics (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autoworks (a pseudonym) is a large automobile manufacturer. The company designs vehicle systems, like body structures, fuel systems, and powertrains, and it analyzes the interactions among them on a number of parameters. One of the most important of these is how well these systems work together to protect the vehicle’s occupants during a collision. The idea behind “crashworthiness engineering” is that the best chance occupants have of surviving a crash with little or no injury is for the vehicle to absorb the energy of a collision (DuBois, 2004). (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crashworthiness analysts are dependent upon other analysts for information and advice on vehicle design. Analysts are also dependent upon numerous software programs (e.g., pre-processors, solvers, post-processors) to do their work, and those software programs also have computational interdependencies. Given the great number of social and technological interdependencies in crashworthiness engineering work, one would suspect that a small change in one set of relationships would quickly reverberate throughout the work system. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the data collectio n and analysis procedures for this two year ethnographic study can be found in Leonardi’s work (2009b, 2010, 2011, in press). (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2006, Jerry finished development work on a small piece of software that he hoped would make this work much easier. The program, which he named “Intruder,” (see Figure 8) was a simple script. After the solver completed its calculations of the simulation model, analysts would now send information from the solver directly to Intruder to render it for analysis without using the pre-processor to make their intrusion calculations. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine which points to include as recommendations to the user in Intruder, Jerry consulted Balaji, another analyst who worked in the same department at Autoworks. Balaji was a senior analyst to whom Jerry often went for advice. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balaji liked Intruder immensely. Analysts at Autoworks shared large cubicles with one another, and Balaji’s cube-mate, Damen, saw him working with Intruder on multiple occasions. After some conversation about its features, Damen asked Balaji if he might be able to secure a copy. Balaji told Damen to ask Jerry if he could try a copy, and Jerry agreed. Damen quickly became a fervent Intruder user. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, this case reads like a fairly common diffusion of technology story: Intruder’s use spreads across a social network, and this diffusion is lubricated by various social forces. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These advice-seeking behaviors were highly correlated with proximity and friendship. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceptions of expertise were based predominantly on advice-seeking behaviors. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After analysts had used Intruder for two years, many changes were evident in the structure of their advice networks. Advice-seeking about what points to select became decoupled from advice about why one should select those points. Analysts who were both junior and senior stopped asking their colleagues for advice about what and turned their queries toward Intruder. Although Intruder was helpful at aiding analysts in deciding what points to select, it was of no help in instructing analysts as to why those were the correct points in the first place. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic of this shift in advice-seeking behaviors was simple: If someone relied on the technology to tell them what points to select, the software’s developer must know why those were the appropriate points. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of this case, simple though they may be, are actually fairly difficult to capture with traditional network models. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An observer of th is longitudinal, unidimensional (unimodal, uniplex) network analysis would likely conclude that Intruder disturbed the existing fabric of social relationships in crashworthiness engineering at Autoworks, perhaps supplanting analysts as a source of information. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we analyze this case using a unimodal multiplex network, we would uncover a very different story than what we saw in a unimodal uniplex network. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did Intruder simply teach analysts how to select points, and now, they no longer need to seek advice on this behavior? The answer is unclear because technologies are not represented in the model. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis of this case using a multimodal uniplex network (Figure 11) would help to more clearly explain the specific role that Intruder played at Autoworks. F (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story an observer of these networks might tell is one of deterministic technological change—a newer technology replacing an older technology. Due to the uniplex nature of the network, the observer would not know who of the analysts, if any, sought advice from each other about what points to select. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 12 depicts the dynamics of the case using a multimodal, multiplex (or a partial multidimensional) network, in which multiple relations are represented between two types of nodes. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If observers used this partial multimodal, multiplex network to interpret the dynamics of the (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;case, they would likely conclude that, before Intruder, junior people did not seek advice at all, from anyone or any technology. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 13 provides an illustration of a full multidimensional network for this case. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By examinin g multiplex ties among and between nodes of different types, we can see that advice-seeking practices and attributions of expertise that were directed toward senior analysts before the implementation of Intruder are now split between Intruder and Jerry. Intruder has become the central actor in what advice consultations, and it is seen by analysts as an expert in what knowledge. Jerry has become the central actor in why advice consultations, and he is seen as an expert in why knowledge. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By examining this multidimensional network longitudinally, we can also begin to make inferences about how these shifts in network dynamics occurred. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustration of the sociomaterial dynamics of crashworthiness engineering at Autoworks shows that many of the alternatives in the network typology presented in the previous section fail to capture the richness of these data. As we moved progressively through each analytic alternative, we sought to demonstrate how this narrative can be best understood when the new technology and other non-human artifacts are considered to be part of the multidimensional network, rather than as separate entities influencing and being influenced by the social network. We used the fully multidimensional network framework to understand the structure and dynamics of networks involving different types of nodes (people and technology) and different types of relations both among and between people and technologies. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rich interplay between people and technology was progressively revealed as we considered a unimodal uniplex representation (Figure 9), a unimodal multiplex representation (Figure 10) or a multimodal uniplex representation (Figure 11), a multimodal multiplex representation (Figure 12) with relations only between nodes of different types (people and technologies), and finally, a multimodal multiplex &amp;ldquo;fully multidimensional&amp;rdquo; representation (Figure 13) with multiple types of relations among and between nodes of different types (people and technologies). (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many authors recommend longitudinal, ethnographic approaches to capture the sociomaterial dynamics of organizing (e.g., Leonardi &amp;amp; Barley, 2010; Orlikowski &amp;amp; Scott, 2008), this type of study is not always possible. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;complex dynamic sociomaterial phenomena (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KB discourse as such (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when attempting to identify and explain sociomaterial dynamics at scale, it is helpful to have certain heuristics with which to be able to detect particular patterns within the data. In the next section, we explore these multidimensional representations. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing Multi-Theoretical Multilevel Models of Multidimensional Networks (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of analytic techniques to explain the emergence of networks is often motivated by multi- theoretical multilevel (MTML) models (Monge &amp;amp; Contractor, 2003). These models are multi-theoretical because of a growing recognition among social networks researchers that the emergence of a network can rarely be adequately explained by a single theory. Therefore, these models combine disparate theoretical generative mechanisms, such as self-interest, collective action, social exchange, balance, homophily, proximity, contagion, and co-evolution. These models are multilevel because the emergence of a network can be influenced, for instance, by theories of self-interest that refer to characteristics of actors (at the individual level), theories of social exchange that describe ties between pairs of actors (at the dyadic level), theories of balance that explain configuration of ties among three actors (at the triadic level), and theories of collective action that explain configurations among larger aggregates of actors (at the group or network level). (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest from an analytic perspective is that each of these theoretical generative mechanisms has a “structural signature” that is unique to that theory. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent statistical advances, such as exponential random graph models (also known as p*, see Robins, Snijders, Wang, Handcock, &amp;amp; Pattison, [2007] for a recent review) are able to assess the degree to which these structural signatures are observed in a network, above and beyond what might be expected in comparable random networks. As such, these methods provide the means to test multi-theoretical multilevel hypotheses about mechanisms that explain the emergence of networks (Contractor, Wasserman, &amp;amp; Faust, 2006). (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;check the reference (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 14. Examples of Structural Signatures Associated with Theories of Network Emergence. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although MTML models have been used to understand the emergence of unidimensional networks among unimodal nodes (such as people or organizations), there is considerable potential for developing and testing new theories to explain the emergence of multidimensional networks. Software tools now exist to test multi-theoretical multilevel hypotheses for cross-sectional and longitudinal partially multidimensional networks—those that are multiplex or multimodal but without relations among different types of nodes (Seary &amp;amp; Richards, 2000; Huisman &amp;amp; Van Duijn, 2005;; Handcock, Butts, Goodreau, &amp;amp; Morris, 2008; Steglich, Snijders, &amp;amp; West, 2006). (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opens up the possibility of inscribing a vast number of new structural signatures that capture the dynamics of how multiple network relations among and between individuals and technologies will enable or constrain their dynamics. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the concept of structural signature is very interesting. No work has been done for CSCL yet. Healthy discourse could have a (or several) structural signature. Food for thought. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case study described in the previous section offers several provocative examples of structural signatures that might be particularly relevant in understanding the emergence of the multidimensional network depicted in Figure 13. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons ider how extant theories of network emergence might be used in the present example. The theory of transactive memory systems developed by Moreland (1999) and Wegner (1995), for example, has been used extensively to explain the emergence of knowledge networks (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This structural signature serves to valida te a hypothesis offered by transactive memory theory in a multidimensional network. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the above example based on the theory of transactive memory systems also illustrates the potential of extending existing theory from unidimensional to multidimensional networks. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the co-presence of an expertise relation and a retrieval relation might occasionally occur in any random network, the ERGM/p* analysis would likely prove to be statistically insignificant. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the network at Time 1 in Figure 13 suggests a novel structural signature with potentially interesting theoretical insights. Notice that, though Balaji recognizes the expertise embodied in the government document, he is more inclined to retrieve that information from Jerry, who retrieved that information from the document. This pattern might suggest a structural signature that, when given a choice to retrieve information from a technology or an individual, people are more likely to retrieve the information from other people who have already retrieved it from the document. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 13 also provides several illustrations of how structural signatures can be used to theorize the dynamics of networks—in this case, from Time 1 to Time 2. One focal point is the emergence of the new Intruder software as an important network node. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of this new technology by Jerry resulted in several individuals within the network adopting the new technology based on contagion, social exchange, proximity, homophily, or friendship ties with Jerry and his colleagues. The adoption of this technology by an individual is represented by the presence of a retrieval link from the individual to the Intruder technology. A structural signature for this adoption based on contagion would suggest that a person would create a retrieval link to Intruder if the person had a friendship link to another person who already had a retrieval link to Intruder. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar approach can be used to test the hypothesis that proximity leads to adoption of a new technology. In this case, the structural signature would suggest that a person is more likely to retrieve information from Intruder if they have a proximity tie to another individual who retrieves information from this same new technology. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, structural signatures can also be used to develop new theories about how the introduction of technology, a new node in a multidimensional network, can transform the structure of relations in that multidimensional network. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This modest case study illustrates the distinctive structural signatures that emerge from an analysis of a multidimensional network. Our goal here has been to develop a multidimensional framework, and to demonstrate how it can be used to tease out novel structural signatures that capture the richness missed by unidimensional analyses. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the multidimensional network approach and methods will enable us to develop novel theories, and to more precisely test extensions to existing theories with a degree of inferential certitude that will benefit from, and contribute to, the careful case studies and in-depth ethnographies that have been the mainstay of scholarship based on actor-network theory and sociomateriality. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, there are three reasons for the development of MTML models of multidimensional networks. First, articulation of new multidimensional structural signatures will enable us to examine unique network patterns. Second, it enables us to empirically investigate the extent to which multiple structural signatures (which, in turn, reflect multiple logics of attachment) might simultaneously be considered in understanding the emergence of the multidimensional networks. Third, it opens the possibility of attempting to understand the emergence of multidimensional networks where there is a large corpus of digital data tracing the network relations within and between human actors and technologies. In such cases, MTML models can be used to posit and detect structural signatures that have previously been proposed or tentatively identified using theory or ethnographies. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promise of this approach is further accentuated by the potential of applying these frameworks to address interesting and intriguing questions about the emergence of multidimensional networks that are on the scale of the Web (Lazer et al., 2009). The increasingly easy access to large amounts of multidimensional network data from the Web within the past decade make this challenge eminently addressable. Specifically, the recent exponential growth in the development and utilization of the Semantic Web (especially the Linked Open Data initiative) offers considerable promise in capturing, collating, and reasoning about large-scale multidimensional networks (Berners-Lee et al., 2006; Hall, this special section; Shadbolt, Hall, &amp;amp; Berners-Lee, 2006).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This short essay makes some really great points about the emergence of multidimentinoal networks (multimode, multiplex) in the context of Internet evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there are some success stories that suggest the need to understand the social factors that shape the use of technologies to create and sustain organizational, interorganizational, and community knowledge networks. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as developments in information and communication technologies continue to reduce or eliminate the potential logistic barriers to our communication and knowledge networks, it becomes increasingly important to identify the various social factors that enable or constrain the development of these network linkages. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay outlines four recent developments that serve as an intellectual springboard to significantly advance our ability to understand and enable these multidimensional networks. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in theorizing the social motivations for emergence of multidimen- sional networks (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he need to theorize about the emergence of linkages in ‘‘multidimensional networks’’—where the nodes are people as well as ‘‘nonhuman agents’’ such as documents, datasets, analytic tools, and concepts (or keywords) (Hollingshead &amp;amp; Contractor, 2002). The links among these nodes would include, for instance, people accessing/creating/citing documents, documents that report results based on a dataset, analytic tools used to investigate a dataset, keywords associated with certain documents,andsoon. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In intellectual terms, we ask the question: What are the social motivations that help us understand why we as individuals seek to forge, sustain, or dissolve our knowledge network ties with other human and nonhuman agents? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;including social network theory (Monge &amp;amp; Contractor, 2003), network society (Castells, 2001) and actor-network theory (Latour, 2005). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development of cyberinfrastructure/Web 2.0 to capture vast amounts of relational metadata (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web 2.0, Semantic web, and cyberinfrastructure technologies that have enabled the multidimensional networks described above also provide the opportunity to capture, tag, and manifest high-resolution high-fidelity relational ‘‘metadata’’ (i.e., which node is connected to which other node) from these multidimensional networks. These include (i) technologies that ‘‘capture’’ communities’ relational metadata (Pingback and trackback in interblog networks, blogrolls, digital traces, data provenance), (ii) technologies to ‘‘tag’’ communities’ relationalmetadata(rangingfromDublinCoretaxonomiestofolksonomies(‘wisdom of crowds’) like tagging pictures (Flickr), social bookmarking (del.icio.us, digg. reddit, LookupThis,BlinkList),socialcitations(CiteULike.org),sociallibraries(discogs.com, LibraryThing.com), social shopping (SwagRoll, Kaboodle, thethingsiwant.com), and social networks (FOAF, XFN, MySpace, Facebook), and (iii) technologies to ‘‘manifest’’ communities’ relational metadata (Tagclouds, Recommender systems, Rating/Reputation systems, (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Internet is the world’s largest social science observatory. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunity for design-assisted theory construction (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent scholarship (Bar &amp;amp; Sandvig, 2008; Lessig, 2006) has documented how software code embedded in technologies has substantial influence on the structuring of society and social interactions. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e have the ability to design new technological features not as an end in itself but a means towards an end–theory construction. Not unlike the design of laboratory experiments, we have the opportunity to embed in the ‘‘design code’’ of technologies various theoretical mechanisms and systematically observe the manner in which these mechanisms interplay with social behaviors. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in confirmatory network analysis to empirically test structural signatures in multidimensional networks (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in the development of statistical techniques such as Exponential Random Graph Modeling (also known as p*) in social network analysis have created the opportunity for a new generation of ‘‘confirmatory network analysis’’ - to empirically test cross-sectional and longitudinal hypotheses about the extent to which multiple theoretical motivations, operating at multiple levels of analysis, contribute to the emergence an observed multidimensional network (Robins et al., 2007).

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: Interesting use of activity theory. There is an attempt to advance AT in this piece as well. The focus on &amp;lsquo;4 faces&amp;rsquo; of activity systems is interesting and may be combined with automated, network measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;m-learning is a new peda- gogical option for teachers. Indeed, “in a short space of five years, mobile learning (m-learning) has moved from being a theory, explored by academic and technology enthusiasts, into a real and valuable contribution to learning” (Stead, 2005, p. 1) making it a viable tool for the classroom. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile learning (m-learning) is a contested and multifaceted term (Coyle et al., 2007) meaning different things to different people. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory (AT) is used as the lens through which the teacher’s role during m-learning is ana- lyzed in an attempt to find a “language of description” to coin Bernstein’s phrase, which captures the centrality of the role of teachers in this multimodal digital world of learning. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT Models (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engestrom’s (1987) first generation model of AT emerged from the work of Vygotsky on mediation. The initial model comprised three elements: the subject, the object, and the mediating artifacts (tools or instruments) as indicated in the upper triangle of Figure 1. The basic concept of AT is that all human activities are mediated by culturally defined or created signs or tools; that is, the “subject” (person) interacts with the “object” (lesson content) through the use of the mediating tools (mobile technology) to achieve the “outcome” (goal). Through external interactions with these tools, the internal mental state of the individual is transformed (Aboulafia, Gould, &amp;amp; Spyrou, 1995). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social context is key to the transformation of the individual or “subject,” and there- fore three additional elements—rules, community, and divi- sion of labor—were added to the model. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “division of labor” acts in two dimensions—vertically and horizontally—and refers to “the horizontal division of tasks between the members of the community and to the vertical division of power and status” (Engestrom, 1993, p. 67). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although m-learning has received a positive reception in the technology-enhanced learning arena, much of the research has focused on its impact on learners and its role in offering pupils rich and authentic learning experiences. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, studies have been short term, and learners have used the ready-made learning experiences already uploaded on the mobile devices, often referred to as “teacher-led mobile learning experiences” as pupils have no input into the design, content, or method of use of these “programs.” The research in this article is unique in that it considers the power and control dynamics of the role of the teacher using m-learning over the course of an academic year for teaching geography. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embedded within the AT model are four higher order functions arising from mutual relationships among the near- est neighbors within the model (Holt &amp;amp; Morris, 1993; Nardi, 1998). Each function represents an aspect of human activity: “production,” “distribution,” “exchange,” and “consump- tion” (Youn &amp;amp; Baptiste, 2007). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Engestrom (1987), “production” creates objects that correspond to the given needs or desired objectives of the system. “Distribution” divides the workload or activities in accordance with the social laws of the community, while “exchange” captures the social interactions from the previously agreed distribution of activities. Finally, “consumption” relates to the achieving of (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;structural and interactional. The structural level relates to the social division of labor and the strength of the boundaries between divisions or subject specialism in the school con- text. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the objective within the community or system by the subject. Within the activity system, “production” is viewed as the starting point, “consumption” as the conclusion, with “distri- bution” and “exchange,” the interim processes (Engestrom, 1987). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through investigating a system in detail, contradic- tions and internal tensions between the elements are revealed. Classrooms are multifaceted, multidimensional organiza- tions (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interactional level refers to the social rela- tionships in the learning context, as determined by the extent of transmission and/or acquisition between the teacher and the pupils—that is, the pedagogical processes used in the classroom environment. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of a more constructivist approach to teaching and learning by the teachers who were “early adopters” of technology (Rogers, 2005), the control has shifted with these new pedagogical practices. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Cole and Engestrom (1993) aver “reflective appro- priation of advanced models and tools provide ways out of internal contradictions” (p. 40) resulting in new activity sys- tems. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within AT, Engestrom (1999) supports the assertion by Leont’ev (1978) that “The activity of individual people thus depends on their social position” (p. 10) and therefore the impact of “framing” is embedded in the activity system within the learning environment. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engestrom’s (1999) “third generation” AT reveals that multiple applications of AT can be applied to a joint activity system as a mechanism to analyze and review the role of various “subjects” as the dominant perspective in the system. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers can invoke a strong influence on the activity system through their choice of tools, rules and predefined division of labor within the community, or they can assume a low level of regulation and allow the activity system to continually find an equilibrium position in which the pupils can work effectively as a com- munity, sharing leadership and agreeing to their own rules to optimize performance at any given moment in time. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, the singular activity system in Figure 1, of using mobile technology for classroom teaching, is used to deter- mine the position of the teacher within the system while maintaining the focus on pupils’ learning and therefore pro- poses placing the teacher within the pupils’ AT model rather than existing in parallel to it. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the AT framework, an analysis of the distri- bution of power and control can be investigated within this new technology-enhanced activity system and the position of the teacher determined. As Daniels and Warmington (2007) posit “activity theory should also develop a language of description which allows for the parameters of power and control to be considered at structural and interactional levels of analysis” (p. 388). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power and Control in AT (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernstein (2000, 1981) considers the impact of rules, inher- ent in the ethos of the institution, on the communicative dis- course used by teachers and pupils alike. He defines the power and control in pedagogical practices in two tiers: (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research aims to problematize the role of the post-pri- mary geography teacher using m-learning during one aca- demic year. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mobile Learning Environment (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action research was used in this predominantly qualita- tive study, as it provided the teacher involved in the m-learn- ing activities with the autonomy to structure and organize the m-learning tasks to map into the existing curricular require- ments and scheme of work (McNiff, 1994). It also empow- ered the teacher to capture the decision-making process of all participants in the study—teacher, pupils, and technical/ research support—through detailed observations recorded in a journal or log over the duration of the research. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mscapes superimpose our everyday environments with a “digital canvas,” meaning locations are geo-tagged with multimedia (Loveless et al., 2008). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pupils were able to “walk” the length of the river from source to mouth seeing the key physical features typical at each stage of the river’s profile. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were quiz questions embedded at key stages along the route in an attempt to sustain the pupils’ attention and to promote recall of the important river features and physical processes such as erosion, transportation, and depo- sition. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Thames mscape was a teacher created, pupil experienced linear multimedia experience in which the teacher had full control over the content of the activity and the inclusion of the learning intentions for the task. In Bernstein’s terms, there was strong classification (teacher power) and strong framing (teacher control). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the treasure hunt mscapes were pupil directed and created, and then once tested, the pupils experienced each other’s mscape activities and offered feedback to their peers. This student-centered pedagogy showed the presence of low classification (low levels of teacher direction/power) and weak framing (due to increased pupil control). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addi- tion, the activity system does not exist in a vacuum nor is it a static framework. It is dynamic, allowing for the unexpected, which may come from within the system (internal contradic- tions) or from outside (external contradictions). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with the challenge of creating their own mscape, the pupils’ group journals revealed insights into the struggle this became for some pupils over the duration of the project (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the treasure hunt mscape, the pupils were assigned into three groups by the teacher. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing m-Learning Through the Lens of AT (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very essence of AT is “activity.” It is not so much interested in how the participant uses the tech- nology but their interaction with this mediating device for learning. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there was consensus that the workload was unevenly distributed with pupils declaring “The group lead- ers got too much.” (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These contradictions indicate that AT can be utilized effectively to capture the tensions that often go unnoticed in groupwork or remain hidden from the teacher as traditionally the pupils do not have a voice to express their concerns about the learning processes being utilized by teachers. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher and researchers’ reflections on these outdoor events noted the changing role being adopted within and across groups of pupils. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power/ control dynamic in these cases rested squarely with the teacher (and researcher) during this phase of the work. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some pupils simply did not like the technology stating this plainly as “I don’t like technology,” (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the collective “consumption” of knowledge through m-learning is diminished. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that the research highlighted the importance of distin- guishing where the teacher’s role was positioned within the activity system and what factors preempted the movement of the power/control dynamic back to the teacher. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally as depicted in Figure 2c, if the subject and the community collaborate too closely on the task, there can be a detrimental effect on the achievement of the learning objectives (O), resulting in a negative impact on “consumption” of knowledge. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why? (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a slightly unfamiliar write-up. Many results get reported in the method section. Is this typical? (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the same strategy for analyzing the three elements of the “exchange” face, namely, rules &amp;reg;, subject (S), and community &amp;copy;, the equilibrium between these three ele- ments was not sustained across all the m-learning tasks. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in reality, tensions existed between these vertices in the activity system causing the figurative representations of the activity system at any moment in time to be a distorted version of Figure 1. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;very interesting way to consider the activity system. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the formal and informal rules governing the use of m-learning activities overwhelmed some of the participants, driving the subjects and the community together and away from the rules &amp;reg; as shown in Figure 3a. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overdominance of one person (S) could also adversely affect the balance between the exchange of information and knowl- edge within the group community (C; Figure 3b), especially when group members remained true to the formal and infor- mal rules, which resulted in fewer exchanges between the group members and the isolated position of the domineering pupil. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “consumption” aspect of AT lies at the heart of knowledge creation and could therefore be considered as the cornerstone of m-learning. Figure 2 illustrates that the equi- librium between the subject (S), object (O), and community &amp;copy; can be negatively affected by the isolation or perceived lack of support given to some individuals during the m-learn- ing activities. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3c captures the occasions when the group com- munity dominated the m-learning experiences and the indi- vidual subject’s voice could not be heard. This situation was observed in one group during the creation phase of the trea- sure hunts when pupils breached the rules of effective group- work and an individual’s initiative was stifled by the community resulting in less productive exchange of ideas and a reduced learning experience. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, technical problems experienced by an individual subject (S) when using the PDA (for the Thames mscape) can distance the subject from the commu- nity and the object of learning, meaning some students lag behind the main body of the group and complete the objec- tives of the task much later than their peers (Figure 2a). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “production” face captures the more competitive ele- ments of using m-learning as the pupils were designing and creating their own product in groups. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if the subject becomes too dominant within the peer group in an effort to achieve the learning objectives (Figure 2b), then the rest of the group will suffer as the opportunity for learning (through the treasure hunts) has been removed. In the absence of constructive and inclusive leadership, the community &amp;copy; itself can become isolated, (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pupils (usually the group leaders) felt overburdened and iso- lated when left with the responsibility of gathering resources for the task as denoted by the subject (S) being “distanced” from the instruments (I) and object (O). In the early stages of production, the pupils were distant from the instrument and the learning objectives (Figure 4a); (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other pupils who understood the task and were comfort- able with the objectives of the activity, their challenge was coping with the new technology (instruments [I]) as shown in Figure 4b. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the pupils became fixated with the instruments, such as the PDAs or resource creation, resulting in the subjects losing sight of the learning objec- tives (O) as shown in Figure 4c. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final face, “distribution” also experienced tensions at various stages in the research. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some groups, the objectives (O) were achieved at the expense of community &amp;copy; as collaboration and support for those pupils with heavy workloads (D) were not addressed, causing tensions within the group as discussed by the group leaders (Figure 5a). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of the teacher varied across the m-learning activ- ities ranging from a driver to a facilitator of the learning pro- cess or a participant in the problem-solving within a group. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this shared ownership of the learning experi- ence resulted in some pupils creating a gap in their subject knowledge (the object of the learning [O]) as shown in Figure 5b where the object became isolated from the community and division of labor. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when the division of labor (D) to achieve the object (O) of the m-learning task became the focus of the community &amp;copy;, valuable time was wasted agreeing to roles instead of working together as a team sharing ideas to achieve the common goal (Figure 5c) of the m-learning task. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT is more than a geometrical representation of faces and vertices. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although AT was effective in interpreting the specific ele- ments of the m-learning experience from the pupils’ perspec- tive, it seemed to fail to simultaneously capture the complexity of the real-world experience for all partici- pants—teacher and pupils. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands, the single AT model ousts teachers from the central position they assume when leading and facilitating the m-learning activities and removes the opportunity to describe their unique role alongside the pupils in m-learning. This outcome is in sharp contrast to the purpose of AT, which relies on social interaction and is underpinned by inclusion, flexibility, and the importance of identifying the contribution of all components and their inter-relationships (Uden, 2007). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Uden and Kumaresan (2007) acknowledge, AT is a simplification of reality and multiple activity systems are at work in parallel around us. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be asserted that within AT, the “subject” can be interpreted as both the teacher and the pupil as they are participants in the activity system; however, this arrangement fails to recognize the reality of the situation where a synergy exists between both these players in the m-learning process. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Three-Dimensional (3D) AT Model (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locating the Teacher in a Single AT Model (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilitative role of the teacher in ensuring a positive learning experience for all pupils requires dynamic interac- tions between pupils and teachers. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This promi- nent position is not necessarily a position of authority or hierarchy. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By converting the current two-dimensional (2D) model to a 3D model, the teacher can be located at the center of the triangular pyramid, equidistant from all vertices but still within the activity system and avoiding a hierarchical status (see Figure 6). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in the above analysis of the activity system in action, the role of the teacher becomes excluded when m-learning is viewed through the lens of the AT model, (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “consumption” of m-learning is key to the activity system and therefore should act as the base or foun- dation of the 3D triangular pyramid, making the subject, community, and object vertices the base of the pyramid. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sides of the pyramid are therefore the remaining three faces—production, distribution, and exchange. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the apex of the pyramid, the three elements, rules, instruments, and division of labor converge, symbol- izing the “pedagogy” of the activity system. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it highlights the centrality of the teacher in connecting the learning environment and pedagogy to create an effective m-learning experience for the pupils. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the new 3D model of AT, the higher order func- tions of “production,” “distribution,” “exchange,” and “con- sumption” are more clearly defined as playing a key role in sustaining the balance within the activity system as a whole. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This force from within the AT model could be referred to as adaptive framing. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great article by Shane Dawson, which sports a very well-written intro and discussion. The SNA analysis conducted in this study is different from those in SNAPP studies, emphasizing ego-centric networks of high- vs. low-performing students in a large lecture (N &amp;gt; 1000). The results are interesting (and mostly unsurprising), showing that high-performing students had larger ego-networks, connected with peers with higher performance and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shows how data about student ‘movement’ within and across a learning community can be captured and analysed for the purposes of making strategic interventions in the learning of ‘at risk’ students in particular, through the application of social network analysis to the engagement data. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an unprecedented opportunity for educators to visualise changes in student behaviour and their learning network composition (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is increasing recognition within the education literature of the importance of student social or peer networks to learning, and more specifically to learning performance (Cho, Gay, Davidson &amp;amp; Ingraffea, 2007), a sense of community (Dawson, 2008), class cohesion (Reffay &amp;amp; Chanier, 2003), and information and resource exchange (Haythornthwaite, 2006). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;shifts the focus of studies from developing an understanding of the whole network community (entire social group) to examinations of the patterns of behaviour and tie connections (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for individual or ego-networks (Saltz, Hiltz &amp;amp; Turoff, 2004). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;recognition of the importance of social networks in education milieu (Brown &amp;amp; Adler, 2008; Tinto, 1998) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this paper elaborates a study that examined the types of relationships (networks) students foster in an online education setting and their impact on learning performance. Specifically, the study explored differences in network composition for lowand high-performing students in order to identify patterns of network behaviour that might have influenced learning, and showed how these findings could be applied as a guide to assist educators in the evaluation of implemented online activities.

&lt;p&gt;Terms such as social learning (Brown &amp;amp; Adler, 2008), social networks (Haythornthwaite, 2002, 2006), social presence (Garrison, 2007; Gunawardena, 1995) and social architecture (Bogenrieder, 2002) have gained increasing prominence within the literature, testifying as they do to the relational nature and purpose of learning. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the increased focus on the social in education can be traced back to the works of Dewey (&lt;sup&gt;1938&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1963&lt;/sub&gt;) and Vygotsky (1978), who maintained that the process of learning is facilitated through individual participation in social interactions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, Alexander Astin (1993) foregrounded the importance of peer learning interactions by arguing that an individual’s peer network is the ‘single most potent source of influence’ (p. 398) on student growth and development. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost a decade later, Richard J. Light (2001) noted that a student’s propensity to participate within small study groups was an accurate predictor of academic success. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Prensky (2001) and others (eg, McWilliam, 2008; Oblinger, 2004) have argued that ‘digital natives’, ‘millennials’ or the ‘yuk/wow generation’ are first and foremost social (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learners. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the ‘social’ is not the context around learning—it is the learning process itself. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While implemented teaching practices can facilitate an increase in the size and make-up of student networks, there are few methods providing instructors with a process for monitoring, visualising and evaluating the evolution of individual student networks. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Network Analysis Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides a valuable methodology for examining the patterns of interaction that occur within a group of actors (a network). As such, SNA draws on various concepts from graph theory and structural theory to evaluate network properties such as density, centrality, connectivity, betweenness and degrees. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasserman &amp;amp; Faust [1994] provide an excellent comprehensive overview of SNA (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flexibility and value of this methodology is reflected in the quantity and diversity of studies adopting SNA techniques. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the teaching and learning context, the usefulness of SNA as a methodology to assess student social networks has also been well demonstrated. For example, Haythornthwaite (1999) used SNA to investigate the frequency and types of interactions between distance learners. The author noted that the implementation of small group work activities promoted the development of stronger ties between individuals and a larger, more complex network. Dawson (2008) identified correlations between SNA centrality measures and student sense of community, noting that degree and centrality were noted to be positive predictors of student sense of community. Additionally, the size and complexity of social networks has also been demonstrated to influence student learning performance (Cho et al, 2007). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the overall extraction and collation of social network data has to date been problematic (Reffay &amp;amp; Chanier, 2002). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online education—untapped data (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In online learning, practitioners guided by socio-constructivist principles have tended to rely on the use of social communication tools such as discussion forums, and more recently blogs and wikis, to generate the peer interactions necessary to promote a sense of community. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collation and analysis of online learning management system (LMS) data have been utilised by a number of researchers in recent times to illustrate relationships between student user-behaviour online and learning and teaching. For instance, Campbell and Oblinger (2007) combined prior academic results with student online effort to develop a predictive model of student attrition. Dawson (2006) extracted discussion forum data to demonstrate correlations between message frequency and student sense of community. Morris, Finnegan and Wu (2005) noted a positive relationship between time spent online in class discussion forums and overall academic performance. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study described below incorporates SNA within an online learning environment to identify differences between individual networks (ego-networks) of highand low-performing students. In so doing, the study addresses the following research questions: • Are there significant differences in the network composition between highand lowperforming students? • Do high-performing students have larger social networks than their low-performing peers? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Is instructor presence more prevalent in the networks of highor low-performing students? • How can the visualisation of student social networks aid pedagogical practice? (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data were collected from a large prerequisite first level chemistry unit (n = 1026) during the September to December 2007 teaching period. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extracting network data (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many commercial LMS have student tracking capabilities as generic software features, the depth of extraction and aggregation, reporting and visualisation functionality of these data has been disappointingly basic or non-existent. Generally speaking, the student tracking data can report on the time spent online, number of pages visited and the number of discussion forum posts contributed or read. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;visualisation of these data is commonly restricted to poorly organised tabular formats, or statistical graphs (Mazza &amp;amp; Dimitrova, 2007). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is lacking in current commercial LMS tracking functionality is the ability to report on the frequency, depth and quantity of peer-to-peer interactions manifesting within the online learning environment and the provision of visual resources to aid instructor interpretation and thus be of immediate pedagogical use. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resource essentially automated the process of extraction, collation, evaluation and visualisation of student network data available as discussion forum postings and interactions. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information and communication technology (ICT) resource was developed in javascript using Greasemonkey (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greasespot.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.greasespot.net/&lt;/a&gt;), a Mozilla Firefox browser extension (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/&#34;&gt;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/&lt;/a&gt;). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These extracted forum data are then exported into Netdraw (Borgatti, 2002), a third party social network visualisation tool. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performing SNA (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the study, SNA was applied to the extracted communication logs (discussion forum activity) to determine the network complexity, key central actors and the level of relationships developed. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the category ‘high performers’ included all students ranked in the 90th percentile. Low-performing students were derived from the 10th percentile. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each ego-network was interrogated for the number and type (staff, student) of connections. The presence of teaching staff was recorded for each ego-network, providing an indication of teacher accessibility and activity in both highand low-performing subgroups. Additionally, the mean grade of all actors in a specific ego-network was calculated. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nonparametric statistical analysis employed in this study was the Mann–Whitney U-test. This statistic was used to assess the level of significant difference between the network size and the academic scores of established social ties between highand low-performing students (90th and 10th percentiles respectively). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network size (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mann–Whitney U-test revealed a significant difference exists between the observed the network size (degree) of lowand high-performing students (Table 1). The results indicate that high performers develop larger social networks (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grades (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;highperforming students primarily develop connections with students of a similar academic capacity. The mean grade score for high performers networks was calculated to be 77.32% (SD = 14.04, n = 376) (Table 2). Similarly, low-performing students were also more inclined to foster online relationships with peers of a comparable academic score (mean = 59.79, SD = 21.3, n = 80). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher presence (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examination of the actors associated with the egonetworks indicated that the teaching staff members were positioned in 81.7% of the high-performing and 34.61% of the low-performing student networks. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the clear differentiation in social ties fostered between the two student subgroups supports the view that ‘similarity breeds connections’ (McPherson, Smith-Lovin &amp;amp; Cook, 2001, p. 415). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all students are responsive to networking possibilities. As Cho et al (2007) found, there are often profound differences in students’ communication style and impact on network composition. They noted that students with a ‘low willingness to communicate’ adopted different network strategies from their more willingly conversant peers. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the problem for low-performing students is exacerbated because their ability to develop a greater understanding of the course content is also impeded by the particular character of the network associations they develop. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central premise of a learning community is that members will share resources, information and collaborate in order to assist one another in a common endeavour, presumed to be learning the content of a specific discipline or, as Brown and Adler (2008) noted, ‘learning to be a full participant in the field’ (p. 19). Despite the rhetoric and best intentions of educators to develop a sense of belonging and shared purpose among a group of learners, conflicting demands and priorities placed on students may result in more self-centred reasoning processes. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is understandable that, while an institution clings to more performanceoriented goals, its students will focus more on their individual performance than the shared project of community-wide learning. In this context, students develop network ties that are tightly connected to providing direct benefit to the individual. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all social ties, of course, are of the same character. Granovetter (1982) maintained that social ties can be classified as either strong or weak. Individuals with strong ties are mutually dependent and share multiple resources. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Florida (2002), author of ‘The rise of the creative class’, suggests that individuals no longer require or seek to build ‘strong’ social ties as these commonly represent more long-term commitments and therefore, constrained mobility. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity to visualise both class and individual networks provides educators with a resource to better identify potentially at-risk students and to also monitor the allocation and direction of teacher support. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces SNAPP, a real-time SNA tool integrated with multiple widely used LMS. The paper explains motivation of designing this tool, multiple design principles of this tool, and its main usefulness (uncovering facilitator centric patterns and identifying isolators). The paper includes various figures to explain the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also many great points made in this paper. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;it is important to note that the educational context the learning activity is positioned in is an important factor that will influence any conclusions drawn&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines the development of a tool designed to provide educators with real-time evaluative data to better support student learning. The Social Networks Adapting Pedagogical Practice (SNAPP) tool extracts student online network data and renders this information into a readily interpretable user-interface. The monitoring of student social networks has been demonstrated to assist educators in identifying instances of learner isolation (McDonald, Stuckey, Noakes, &amp;amp; Nyrop, 2005), creativity (Burt, 2004), and community formation (Dawson, 2008; De Laat, Lally, Lipponen, &amp;amp; Simons, 2007). The ability to view social graph structure and community evolution is crucial to successful facilitation and serves as an early indicator of the success of a learning activity design as well as information about student participation and potential performance. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;refs&lt;br /&gt;
 a few more references (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues for the need for realtime social graph visualisation, describes the design principles behind the development of SNAPP and highlights the key participant and community structural patterns that SNAPP allows forum facilitators to visualise. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the easy access to and vast flexible affordances of LMS, Web 2.0, and other collaborative based ICTs, there remain limited diagnostic tools that are available for education practitioners to better evaluate their implemented learning activities (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the presentation of these statistics is commonly in a format that is both complex and removed from the pedagogical intent and context. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increased focus on developing collaborative and community centric learning endeavours reflects current educational theory, which emphasises the importance of diverse and sustained social interaction for enhancing and facilitating student learning (Gabelnick, MacGregor, Matthews, &amp;amp; Smith, 1990; Levine Laufgraben &amp;amp; Shapiro, 2004; Tinto, 1993; Vygotsky, 1978). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the development of a community of learners or a learning network has become a foundational educational practice for both online and offline education environments. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macfadyen and Dawson (2009) noted that the two most dominant LMS tools within a large Canadian university included the content page for transmission of information and the discussion forum for collaboration and community building. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is well noted by Reffay and Chanier (2002) who suggested that the adoption of Social Network Analysis (SNA) can act as an educational evaluative tool in order to monitor and assess elements of student group cohesion in a collaborative environment. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNAPP – Discussion forum interactions (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Social Networks Adapting Pedagogical Practice (SNAPP) tool was designed to provide educators with realtime access to the evolving social graph within a course. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an alternative solution exists when examining user interaction with threaded discussion forums. The forum succinctly contains all interaction data occurring between participants within the threaded view (See figure 1), thus the discussion forum typically displays all data necessary to establish network properties and relationships. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of a script designed to “skin” the threaded forum for network relationships is an effective alternative. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design Guidelines (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n much the same way, SNAPP was initially designed to infer post-reply interactions from discussion forums in Blackboard and WebCT. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key guidelines governing the design and development of SNAPP are discussed below: (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplifiedinstallationandusage. (p. 4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNAPP as a result has been developed as a client-side bookmarklet requiring only a Web browser for installation and access. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various graph layout algorithms are provided and SNAPP allows the user to: • scale nodes based upon number of posts; • scale connections (edges) based on post-reply strength; • enable/disable the display of participant names; • zoom in and out; and • filter participants based upon the number of interactions (degree).

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreting SNAPP – Example structural patterns and instructor action (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section describes how SNAPP generated network visualisations (sociograms) can be used by facilitators to detect emerging structural patterns (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is important to note that the educational context the learning activity is positioned in is an important factor that will influence any conclusions drawn. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facilitator Centric Patterns The sociogram in Figure 4 illustrates a &amp;lsquo;facilitator&amp;rsquo; centric pattern or “wagon-wheel pedagogy”. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if the purpose of the forum is to foster knowledge sharing and creation, this type of generated sociogram would indicate there is a need to better scaffold the discussion (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learner Isolation Students who are unable to establish peer to peer relationships commonly report feelings of isolation and exclusion (McDonald et al., 2005). Learner isolation has also been noted to be a key factor contributing to student attrition in online courses (Rovai, 2003; Rovai &amp;amp; Wighting, 2005). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion and Future Directions (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social graph is an aggregated visualisation of emerging student to student and student to facilitator relationships. Providing facilitators with a real-time alternative visual representation of a threaded discussion forum essentially serves as a social interaction diagnostic instrument. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is innovation in education it tends to be sporadic and discontinuous, with the result that innovative practices seldom win out against those with a long evolutionary history. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kapur, M., &amp;amp; Bielaczyc, K. (2012). Designing for Productive Failure. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 21(1), 45&amp;ndash;83. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1080&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10508406&lt;/sub&gt;.2011.591717&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clippings&#34;&gt;Clippings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the design principles undergirding productive failure (PF; M. Kapur, 2008). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) PF, in which students collaboratively solved complex problems on average speed without any instructional support or scaffolds up until a teacher-led consolidation; or (b) direct instruction (DI), in which the teacher provided strong instructional support, scaffolding, and feedback (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings suggested that although PF students generated a diversity of linked representations and methods for solving the complex problems, they were ultimately unsuccessful in their problem-solving efforts. Yet despite seemingly failing in their problem-solving efforts, PF students significantly outperformed DI students on the well-structured and complex problems on the posttest. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;greater representation flexibility (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instructional structure is designed to constrain or reduce the degrees of freedom in problem-solving activities (Wood, Bruner, &amp;amp; Ross, 1976), thereby increasing the likelihood of novices achieving performance success. Indeed, a vast body of research supports the efficacy of such an approach. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the role of failure in learning and problem solving, much as it is intuitively compelling, remains largely underdetermined and underresearched by comparison (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the role of failure in learning and problem solving, much as it is intuitively compelling, remains largely underdetermined and underresearched by comparison (Clifford, 1984; Schmidt &amp;amp; Bjork, 1992). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our work is grounded in the belief that engaging novices to try, and even fail, at tasks that are beyond their skills and abilities can, under certain conditions, be productive for developing deeper understandings. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE ROLE OF FAILURE IN LEARNING AND PROBLEM SOLVING (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several scholars and research programs have spoken to the role of failure in learning and problem solving (Clifford, 1984). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schmidt and Bjork (1992) reviewed methods used in the training of motor and verbal skills. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the notion of “desirable difficulties” (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;research on impasse-driven learning (Van Lehn, Siler, Murray, Yamauchi, &amp;amp; Baggett, 2003) in coached problem-solving situations provides strong evidence for the role of failure in learning. Successful learning of a principle (e.g., a concept, a physical law) was associated with events when students reached an impasse during problem solving. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impasse means a situation of deadlock.. Quite relevant to Promisingness .. Or the opposite side&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;impasse-driven learning (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van Lehn et al.’s (2003) findings suggest that it may well be more productive to delay that structure up until the student reaches an impasse—a form of failure—and is subsequently unable to generate an adequate way forward. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is differnt for promisingness is it asks students themselves to find the way out, rather than merely allowing them to experience such impasse for later structure or direct instruction. This is very differnt.&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwartz and Martin (2004). In a sequence of design experiments on the teaching of descriptive statistics to intellectually advanced students, Schwartz and Martin demonstrated an existence proof for the hidden efficacy of invention activities when such activities preceded DI (e.g., lectures), despite such activities failing to produce canonical conceptions and solutions during the invention phase. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kapur’s (2008) work on PF adds further weight to the role of failure in learning and problem solving. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kapur examined students solving complex, ill-structured problems without the provision of any external support structures. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kapur (2008) argued that delaying the structure received by students from the ill-structured groups (who solved ill-structured problems collaboratively followed by well-structured problems individually) helped them discern how to structure an ill-structured problem, thereby facilitating a spontaneous transfer of problemsolving skills. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a growing body of research that emphasizes the need to understand conditions under which delaying structure during instruction can enhance learning (e.g., diSessa, Hammer, Sherin, &amp;amp; Kolpakowski, 1991; Lesh &amp;amp; Doerr, 2003; Slamecka &amp;amp; Graf, 1978). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These studies, however, indicate more than simply a delay of instructional structure. They also underscore the presence of desirable difficulties and productive learner activity in solving problems. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this interest in what is present, that is, the features of productive learner activity (even if it results in “failure”), that forms the core of our work. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESIGNING FOR PF (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature provides insight into why providing instructional structure too early in the problem-solving process can be problematic. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, students often do not have the necessary prior knowledge differentiation to be able to discern and understand the affordances of domain-specific representations and methods given during DI (e.g., Schwartz &amp;amp; Martin, 2004; for a similar argument applied to perceptual learning, see Garner, 1974; Gibson &amp;amp; Gibson, 1955). Second, when concepts, representations, and methods are presented in a well-assembled, structured manner during DI, students may not understand why those concepts, representations, and methods are assembled in the way that they are (Anderson, 2000; Chi, Glaser, &amp;amp; Farr, 1988; diSessa et al., 1991; Schwartz &amp;amp; Bransford, 1998). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;designing for PF requires engaging students in a learning design that embodies four core interdependent mechanisms: (a) activation and differentiation of prior knowledge in relation to the targeted concepts, (b) attention to critical conceptual features of the targeted concepts, &amp;copy; explanation and elaboration of these features, and d) organization and assembly of the critical conceptual features into the targeted concepts. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does promisingness require? Probably a favorable epistemic belief that thinks ideas are improbable. Then an understanding of current state of art of community knowledge. And an activation when presented a promising idea.. Add more&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;four core interdependent mechanisms (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What mechanisms could I design for promisingness?&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a design comprising two phases: a generation and exploration phase (Phase 1) followed by a consolidation phase (Phase 2). Phase 1 affords opportunity for students to generate and explore the affordances and constraints of multiple representations and solution methods (RSMs). Phase 2 affords opportunity for organizing and assembling the relevant student-generated RSMs into canonical RSMs. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designs of both phases involved decisions concerning the creation of the activities, the participation structures, and the social surround (see Figure 1). These decisions were guided by the following core design principles to embody the aforementioned mechanisms: 1. Create problem-solving contexts that involve working on complex problems that challenge but do not frustrate, rely on prior mathematical resources, and admit multiple RSMs (mechanisms a and b); 2. Provide opportunities for explanation and elaboration (mechanisms b and c); and 3. Provide opportunities to compare and contrast the affordances and constraints of failed or suboptimal RSMs and the assembly of canonical RSMs (mechanisms b–d). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social surround (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;activity (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participation structures (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGURE 1 The three layers of the productive failure design. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These three levels might also inform my design..&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Generation and Exploration of RSMs The overall design goal of Phase 1 was to afford opportunities for students to generate and explore a wide variety of RSMs for solving novel, complex problems. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the activity: “sweet-spot” calibration of complex problems. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complexity of the problems (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;complex problem scenarios afford multiple RSMs and often require students to make and justify assumptions (Jonassen, 2000; Spiro, Feltovich, Jacobson, &amp;amp; Coulson, 1992; Voss, 1988). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior mathematical resources of students. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affective draw of the problem scenario. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;more engaged and interested in the problem when it was presented in the form of a narrative with dialogue. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a “comic strip” format would have more appeal (e.g., Kapur &amp;amp; Lee, 2009). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the participation structures: enabling collaboration. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because collaborative problem solving has been found to be an enabling mechanism that allows students to share, elaborate, critique, explain, and evaluate shared work (Chi et al., 1988; Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 2003), smallgroup collaboration was used as the participation structure during Phase 1. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in our work, the grouping of students into small groups was not based simply on randomization but on leveraging teachers’ understandings of the social dynamics (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to maximize the likelihood that group members would work well together in their assigned groups (E. G. Cohen, Lotan, Abram, Scarloss, &amp;amp; Schultz, 2002). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the social surround: creating a safe space to explore. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described, the role of the teacher was not to provide any cognitive or content-related support but mainly to manage the classroom and provide affective support as part of setting the appropriate expectations and norms for problem solving. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Consolidation and Knowledge Assembly (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall design goal of Phase 2 was to afford opportunities for students to compare and contrast the affordances and constraints of failed or suboptimal RSMs and the assembly of canonical RSMs. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the activity: examining student-generated and canonical RSMs. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to the issue of efficiency. Whether PF will take significantly more time than DI?&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the participation structures: enhancing engagement. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For teachers largely and self-admittedly accustomed to a DI mode, these facilitation strategies are not easily developed or adopted. Hence, a professional development program was carried out to develop the teachers’ facilitation skills and strategies. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the social surround: creating a safe space to explore. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in PF, teachers set the expectations that the discussion of student-generated RSMs was not to assess them as correct or incorrect. Instead, the expectation set was that the process of coming up with RSMs is an important part of mathematical practice (Thomas &amp;amp; Brown, 2007) and that understanding why and under what conditions some RSMs are better than others is important for developing mathematical understanding (diSessa &amp;amp; Sherin, 2000). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXAMINING THE PF DESIGN IN SINGAPORE SCHOOL CONTEXTS (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiments were conducted with Grade 7 students at three mainstream, coeducational, public schools in Singapore. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the PSLE Math grade and total score as the two dependent variables, a multivariate analysis of variance revealed a significant multivariate effect among the three schools, F(4, 594) = 437.82, p &amp;lt; .001. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing PF With DI (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;describe these designs next and articulate our hypotheses for comparing them (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cycle of lecture, practice/homework, and feedback then repeated itself over the course of the same number of periods as in the PF condition. Thus, the amount of instructional time was held constant for the two conditions. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that the PF design would afford students greater opportunities to activate and differentiate their prior knowledge; attend to, explain, and elaborate upon the critical conceptual features of the concept of average speed; and (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;understand the assembly of these features into the canonical RSMs. Consequently, PF students would be able to construct deeper conceptual understanding of the concept of average speed compared to students in a DI design. A deeper conceptual understanding should result in better performance in solving problems on average speed on the posttest (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n addition, we also expected that because PF students would have generated and explored a variety of RSMs, they would also demonstrate better representational flexibility in solving problems on average speed on the posttest (Ainsworth, Bibby, &amp;amp; Wood, 2002; Lesh, 1999). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quasi-experimental, pre/post design was used in all three schools. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Sources and Analytical Procedures (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process measures for the PF condition. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group work artifacts were examined to determine the number of PF groups that were able to solve to the complex problems successfully. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group/individual performance. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group RSM diversity. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set of RSMs identified in the group work artifacts was used to chunk the group discussion into smaller episodes. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clear transitions in the discussions when a group moved from one RSM (e.g., ratios, trial and error) to another (e.g., algebra). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of nine different RSMs emerged from this analysis. RSM diversity was defined as the number of different RSMs generated by a group. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process measures for the DI condition. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;homework assignment provided a proxy measure for student performance in the DI condition. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 5-item posttest comprised three well-structured problem items similar to those on the pretest, one complex problem item, and one graphical representation item (see Appendix C for an example of each). (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outcome measures for the PF and DI conditions. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three types of items formed the three dependent variables in a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), with pretest score as the covariate. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These debriefing sessions were captured in audio and transcribed. Data from these sessions are used only as corroborating evidence to support the discussion of our findings. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESULTS (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretest (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;no significant difference between the PF and DI classes (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to RSM diversity, findings suggest that PF groups in all three schools were able to generate multiple RSMs for solving complex problems (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis of covariance revealed a significant difference among schools on RSM diversity, F(2, 181) = 3.51, p = .032, partial η2 = .04. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to group and individual performance on the complex problems, findings suggest that in spite of generating multiple RSMs, students were ultimately unable to solve the problems successfully either in groups or individually. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posttest (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interaction between prior knowledge (covariate) and experimental condition (PF vs. DI) was not significant (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MANCOVA (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multivariate main effect of experimental condition was significant in all three schools. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis also suggested a variance within the PF condition (especially in Schools B and C), which forms the next focus of our investigation (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VARIATION WITHIN THE PF CONDITION (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we focus on unpacking variation in the generation and exploration phase (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we examine whether the diversity of RSMs generated by each group relates to the subsequent posttest performance by members of that group. Based on this relationship, we begin to unpack the actual interactions occurring among group members in generating such RSMs. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an examination of the relationship between group RSM diversity and learning outcomes as measured on the posttest across all PF groups (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, a comparison of the effect sizes suggests that the effect of RSM diversity was about 9 times stronger than the pretest and 13 times stronger than the school. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrasting-Case Analysis (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the role of a collaborative activity structure (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the following contrasting-case analysis is to use discussion excerpts from two groups with contrasting levels of RSM diversity and illustrate how these groups additionally differed in their exploration of the RSMs they generated and how this difference in exploration potentially influenced opportunities to attend to critical features of the problem. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two groups, one with high diversity (hereinafter referred to as Group HD) and another with low diversity (hereinafter referred to as Group LD) from School A that contrasted in their RSM diversity, were selected. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing I wish to know is whether these two groups performed differently in pre-test. If so, it may weaken the authors&amp;rsquo; interpretation of the effect of variation of PF.&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selection of contrasting-case groups. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our strategy is to present the contrasting excerpts2 from the two groups followed by an analysis of the contrast. Each excerpt is also accompanied with interpretive comments for each utterance, the mechanisms (a, b, or c) invoked, and the collaboration moves (e.g., proposal, question, evaluation, explanation) made. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring an RSM. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the two groups seemed to be quite different in terms of the mechanisms invoked, which influenced their understanding of the affordances and constraints of the method (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Group LD’s discussion seemed to be focused mainly on computational features of the guess and check method, there was little evidence that members attended to the critical features of the targeted concept; that is, mechanism b was rarely invoked. In contrast, Group HD’s discussion was at a more conceptual level; that is, the group worked out the ratios of the walking and biking speeds and seemed to have realized that the ratio method does not work when the walking and biking speed ratios are different. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Group HD, solution proposals were met with questions, clarification and agreement, followed by evaluation and more questions, leading to explanations and evaluation and then more explanation until shared understanding was established (Utterances 4–13). (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the collaborative pattern in Group LD was mainly one of solution proposal, followed by question, explanation and computation, with disagreements or alternative viewpoints not being taken up substantively for discussion (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the quantitative analysis of RSM diversity in PF groups shows that the greater the number of RSMs generated by a group, the better the posttest performance of the group members (mechanism a). (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the qualitative contrasting-case analysis serves to illustrate how two groups that (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;differed in the number of RSMs they generated additionally seemed to differ in their collaborative understanding of the problem and exploration of the RSMs and how this difference in exploration potentially influenced opportunities to attend to, explain, and elaborate upon the critical features of the concept of average speed (mechanisms b and c). (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENERAL DISCUSSION (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we found that compared to DI, PF seems to engender deeper conceptual understanding without compromising performance on well-structured problems. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, although we found a significant difference among schools in terms of their students’ ability to generate RSMs for solving the novel, complex problems, this difference among the schools had a notably smaller effect size (η2 = .04) than preexisting differences in general ability (η2 = .85) and mathematical ability (η2 = .44) (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we found that RSM diversity was correlated with learning outcomes (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining PF (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSION (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;conditions that maximize performance in the shorter term may not necessarily be the ones that maximize learning in the longer term (Clifford, 1984; Schmidt &amp;amp; Bjork, 1992). (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four possibilities for design emerge. First is the possibility of designing conditions that maximize performance in the shorter term and that also maximize learning in the longer term. Let us call such design efforts designing for productive success. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the concomitant possibility of designing conditions that may well not maximize performance in the shorter term but in fact maximize learning in the longer term. Let us call such design efforts designing for productive failure. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unproductive success—an illusion of performance without learning—as well as unproductive failure. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;negative knowledge&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An expert is someone who knows some of the worst mistakes that can be made in his subject, and how to avoid them. Werner Heisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the term critical principles to cover any sort of knowledge of types of errors (Bickhard 1991a, forthcoming). Critical principles are not positive knowledge -knowledge of what works or what is true. They are negative knowledge -knowledge of what to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical knowledge must be constructed, just like any other knowledge. And critical knowledge is subject to reflection, just like any other knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the construction of knowledge is progressive&amp;ndash;in a negative sense. Culturally or individually, progress means coming to avoid more kinds of errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive knowledge is often overthrown as new sorts of error are discovered ; negative knowledge is more likely to survive (though its survival is by no means certain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, negative knowledge is most important in the long run. Positive knowledge often gets replaced because it fails the tests imposed by new negative knowledge. Meanwhile, the negative knowledge persists : what counts as error changes much less often than what avoids error. When there are changes in negative knowledge, they tend to add to it rather than overturn old conceptions of error. Negative knowledge is the skeleton around which positive knowledge is organized and the base on which further development occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**From our standpoint, expertise largely consists in a vast knowledge of sorts of errors that can occur and that can be made in myriads of specific circumstances within the domain. Non-experts will tend to blunder into such specific, perhaps rare, errors. All too often, that is how experts acquired their knowledge as well. If we want to understand how people become experts, we need to keep negative knowledge and its development at the forefront. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1.1. Negative knowledge in training. Most forms of expertise require extensive teaching or apprenticeship, although neither guarantees attainment of the highest levels. Today negative knowledge rates little attention from teachers or trainers. Positive knowledge gets the spotlight, as might be expected in a culture like ours that is permeated with empiricism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such attitudes notwithstanding, teaching about misconceptions by presentingcountervailing examples and principles can be most useful. For instance, students’ misconceptions in science are a prevalent, persistent, and troubling phenomenon in education (Berliner and Casanova 1987, Brumby 1984, Champagne et al. 1983, Confrey 1990, Novak 1987, Perkins and Simmons 1988). Such misconceptions frequently maintain their hold on students, even after they have thoroughly mastered the standard positive-knowledge curriculum. Explicitly teaching negative knowledge helps students to overthrow such misconceptions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we would argue that the errors human beings make in mastering a
domain are not all avoidable imperfections, slips, or `performance limitations ’ . Instead, the best possible developmental pathway towards expertise necessarily incorporates errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dijksterhuis, A. (2006). On Making the Right Choice: The Deliberation-Without-Attention Effect. Science, 311(5763), 1005–1007. doi:10.1126/science.1121629&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice article reporting on four studies on the &amp;ldquo;Deliberation-Without-Attention&amp;rdquo; hypothesis; that is, simple choices (such as between different towels or different sets of oven mitts) indeed produce better results after conscious thought, but that choices in complex matters (such as between different houses or different cars) should be left to unconscious thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one goal of education is to help people make sound decisions, how educators could draw on this hypothesis to help students engage with unconscious thinking to make decisions? This work is directly linked to &amp;ldquo;promisingness judgments&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;judgments made when working to achieve creative knowledge goals. Should we work to replicate the studies in the promisingness context?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, conscious thought does not always lead to sound choices. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is not always advantageous to engage in thorough conscious deliberation before choosing. On the basis of recent insights into the characteristics of conscious and unconscious thought, we tested the hypothesis that simple choices (such as between different towels or different sets of oven mitts) indeed produce better results after conscious thought, but that choices in complex matters (such as between different houses or different cars) should be left to unconscious thought. Named the ‘‘deliberation-without-attention’’ hypothesis, it was confirmed in four studies on consumer choice, both in the laboratory as well as among actual shoppers, that purchases of complex products were viewed more favorably when decisions had been made in the absence of attentive deliberation. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two reasons why conscious deliberation sometimes leads to poor judgments have been identified. First, consciousness has a low capacity (17, 18), causing choosers to take into account only a subset of the relevant information when they decide (13, 19). Second, conscious thought can lead to suboptimal weighting of the importance of attributes (13–16): We tend to inflate the importance of some attributes at the expense of others, leading to worse choices. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common knowledge holds that thorough conscious thought leads to good decisions and satisfactory choices. Whether purchasing a new car, a desktop computer, or a pair of shoes, people generally believe that serious conscious deliberation increases the probability that they will make the Bright[ choice. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific literature has emphasized the benefits of conscious deliberation in decision making for hundreds of years (2, 3). The idea that conscious deliberation is the ideal (if not always attainable) way to approach a decision forms the backbone of classic (4, 5) as well as contemporary perspectives on decision making (6, 7) and attitude formation (8, 9). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, unconscious thought, or thought without attention, can lead to good choices (13, 14). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second pervasive idea is that the quality of a choice benefits from Bsleeping on it.[ Rather than (or in addition to) thinking consciously, people usually feel that Bunconscious thought[ is useful for making sound decisions. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conscious thought is hypothesized, due to its precision, to lead to good choices in simple matters. However, because of its low capacity, conscious thought leads to progressively worse choices with more complex issues. Unconscious thought (i.e., deliberation without attention) is expected, because of its relative lack of precision, to lead to choices of lower quality. However, the quality of choice does not deteriorate with increased complexity, allowing unconscious thought to lead to better choices than conscious thought under complex circumstances, this latter idea being the kernel of the deliberation-without-attention hypothesis. Quality of choice was operationalized both normatively (studies 1 and 2) as well as subjectively (as postchoice satisfaction, in studies 3 and 4). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study 2. For the second study we made one change (25). Rather than asking for a choice, we asked participants about their attitudes toward each of the four cars. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we formulated the Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT) (21) about the strengths and weaknesses of conscious thought and unconscious thought, that is, of deliberation with and without attention. Two characteristics of conscious and unconscious thought are important in the current context. First, conscious thought is rule-based and very precise (22, 23). Unconscious thought can conform to rules in that it detects recurring patterns, as the literature on implicit learning shows (24). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study 3. In a pilot study, undergraduate students were asked how many aspects of a product they would take into account in the purchase of 40 different products. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study 1. Participants were subjected to a 2 (mode of thought: conscious versus unconscious) 2 (complexity of choice problem: simple versus complex) factorial design (25). All participants read information about four hypothetical cars. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as alluded to earlier, conscious thought suffers from the low capacity of consciousness, making it less suitable for very complex issues. Unconscious thought does not suffer from low capacity. Indeed, it has been shown that during unconscious thought, large amounts of information can be integrated into an evaluative summary judgment (13). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These characteristics of conscious and unconscious thought led us to postulate the Bdeliberation-without-attention[ hypothesis, on the relation between mode of thought or deliberation (conscious versus unconscious) and the complexity and quality of choice. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite was true for the IKEA customers (complex products), in which case unconscious thinkers showed more postchoice satisfaction than conscious thinkers EF(1,25) 0 6.12, P G 0.02^ (Fig. 4). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, in four studies we demonstrated the deliberation-without-attention effect. Conscious thinkers were better able to make the best choice among simple products, whereas unconscious thinkers were better able to make the best choice among complex products. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We regressed the amount of thought and the average number of aspects on postchoice satisfaction. As expected, thinking does not make people more satisfied, nor does complexity (t_s G 1). However, the interaction of the two parameters significantly predicted postchoice satisfaction Et(48) 0 2.13, P G 0.04^. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlations were calculated between amount of thought and postchoice satisfaction for three categories of products: complex, medium, and simple. For products of medium complexity, no correlation was found Er(18) 0 –0.03^; for simple products, a positive correlation was found Er(15) 0 0.57, P G 0.03^; and for complex products, a negative correlation was found Er(16) 0 –0.56, P G 0.03^. As expected, the more people thought consciously about simple products, the more satisfied they were with their purchase. Conversely, the more people thought consciously about complex products, the less satisfied they were with their purchase. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study 4. On the basis of the pilot study to study 3, two shops were selected: one where people generally buy complex products (IKEA, which sells mainly furniture) and one where people generally buy simple products (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We divided participants (Bthinkers[) on the basis of a median-split procedure into those who engaged in much conscious thought (conscious thinkers) and those who engaged in little conscious thought (unconscious thinkers). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, conscious thinkers reported more postchoice satisfaction than unconscious thinkers for Bijenkorf products (simple (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A principal characteristic of the Canadian experience with e-learning is the uniquely Canadian feature of provincial jurisdiction over education. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, any investigation of e-learning in Canada must focus more on specific provincial initiatives in technologically enhanced learning rather than a Canadian overview. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest at the national level in e-learning was driven mainly through increasing concern over the development of Canada’s “education industry.” (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is considerable activity in e-learning in several provinces, while others have very little. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the majority of courses offered in Canadian universities now have at least some component of either World Wide Web content and/or require some communications using e-mail. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these federal initiatives, the provinces maintained their independence and continued to act autonomously, if not at cross purposes. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberta is a Canadian leader in e-learning with Athabasca University, which is Canada’s only open university or single-mode distance delivery institution. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant trends in Canadian e-learning that should be watched include: (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of common standards supporting the interoperability of learning resources in the form of learning objects; The implementation of technical standards and interoperability tools for instructional design and activities; The establishment of learning object repositories with content available in common interoperable formats using XML; The development and implementation of more robust and peoplefriendly learning management and content management systems; The development and implementation of social software providing students with electronic modes for connecting online socially; The continued rapid growth in “blended learning,” the use of e-learning in various forms in traditional universities; The growth in the use of open source applications, open course content, and open access research; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FuturE trEnds in E-LEarning in Canada (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuing growth in the acceptance of “exchange” credits from other universities. Firstand second-year courses are already accepted by universities across Canada. • The growth in the acceptance of Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) as more and more adults change career paths; • The growth in the use of mobile devices for learning, taking advantage of the interoperability of learning objects; • The growth in the use of games for learning, taking advantage of the technical and pedagogical opportunities made available by the video game consoles and applications; • The continued rapid growth of Athabasca University, Canada’s Open University on track to have more students than any other university in Canada (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebben, M., &amp;amp; Murphy, J. S. (2014). Unpacking MOOC scholarly discourse: a review of nascent MOOC scholarship. Learning, Media and Technology, 39(3), 328–345.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This paper unpacks the MOOC scholarly discourse, with critical lenses that are terribly needed. It focuses on publications from 2009 – 2013, which features the transitional moment from cMOOCs to xMOOCs. The search results &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; include 15 papers published during that time. The data analysis is not complicated, showing a growing body of literature, distribution of papers among different journals. The Discussion section is very &lt;strong&gt;impressive&lt;/strong&gt; as it greatly expand the scope of the analysis conducted in this study to discuss various issues related to MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;: Relatively simple analysis, but great discussion. More like a think-piece than an empirical piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: This paper enriches a thought I current have&amp;ndash;MOOC research operating in different world views, in that it taps into different epistemologies reflected in different MOOCs. I&amp;rsquo;ll think more as preparing for a upcoming Doctoral Consortium. It also highlights the importance of &lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt; discourse analysis in the MOOC scholarship &amp;ndash; which could be quite fascinating as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing upon a comprehensive search of nine leading academic databases, this paper examines the initial phase of MOOC scholarship (2009 – 2013), and offers an analysis of these empirical studies that concep- tualizes themes in MOOC scholarship and locates them within a chrono- logical framework. Two key phases of scholarship about MOOCs are identified, each with associated research imperatives and themes. Phase One: Connectivist MOOCs, Engagement and Creativity 2009 – 2011/ 2012. Themes of Phase One include: development of Connectivism as a learning theory, and technological experimentation and innovation in early cMOOCs. Phase Two: xMOOCs, Learning Analytics, Assessment, and Critical Discourses about MOOCs 2012 – 2013. Themes of Phase Two include: the rise of xMOOCs, further development of MOOC peda- gogy and platforms, growth of learning analytics and assessment, and the emergence of a critical discourse about MOOCs. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) owe their heritage to the open edu- cation movement (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methodology (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle of inclusion was confined to MOOCs described as such by the scholars who investigated them. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tabulated numbers of articles, noted authorship, place of publi- cation, author affiliation, and location. We also analysed the number, type, and location of the journals. Following Silverman (2011), we worked induc- tively to identify learning theories, assumptions, research directions, and themes across the literature to establish a conceptual framework for understand- ing the present landscape of MOOC scholarship. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data collection (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles for analysis were drawn from a comprehensive search of nine leading academic databases starting in the year 2002 to 1 July 2013. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The databases searched were: Academic Search Complete, Communication and Mass Media Complete, Directory of Open Access Journals, Education Full Text, ERIC, Google Scholar, MathSciNet, Science Direct, and Web of Science. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Databases were searched for articles with the word, MOOC, in the title, abstract, or content. This process yielded approximately 43 articles from a variety of sources. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process yielded 25 scholarly articles in peer-reviewed academic journals that were directly about MOOCs. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2. List of journals with MOOC scholarship 2009 – 1 July 2013. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology Distance Education Educational Theory Electronic Journal of e-Learning eLearning Papers European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning International Journal on Computer Science and Engineering Open Praxis Research and Practice in Assessment Telecommunications Journal of Australia (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five continents were represented by the lead authors of the 25 articles in the database: 2 from Africa, 1 from Australia, 8 from Europe, 12 from North (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America, and 2 from South America (Table 3). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional fields, online and distance education, and computer science journals have a relatively brief turn-around time from submission through review to publication because their subject matter is rapidly changing. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as MOOCs continue to evolve, the social and cultural implications of MOOCs may increasingly become the focus of humanities and social science research. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liyanagunawardena, Adams, and Williams (2013) identify eight themes apparent in MOOC scholarship. These include: (1) Introductory (explaining aspects of MOOCs), (2) Concept (discus- sion of threats and opportunities of MOOCs in higher education), (3) Case Studies, (4) Educational theory (pedagogical approaches used), (5) Technology (discussion of hardware and software used), (6) Participant focused ((discussion of participants’ experiences), (7) Provider focused (discussion of course crea- tors and leaders), and (8) Other. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to further organize themes in MOOC scholarship and locate them within a chronological framework to help understand this unfolding body of scholarship. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase one: Connectivist cMOOCs, engagement and creativity 2009–2012 (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Connectivist MOOCs emphasized human agency, user participation, and creativity through a dynamic network of connections afforded by online tech- nology. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mackness, Mak, and Williams (2010) identify attributes of Connec- tivism as network principles of diversity, autonomy, openness, and emergent knowledge but suggest that these attributes may be compromised within some MOOC environments. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kop goes on to identify four learning-enhancing types of activities that can occur within cMOOCs: (1) aggregation (access to lots of content resources), (2) relation (reflection on the aggregated content through blogging, discussion boards, and related technology), (3) creation (assignments or expectations that participants would create new ideas, and (4) sharing (of created content with other participants) (Kop 2011, 21). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nt and are well suited for consistently active participants. Early MOOC researchers sought to operationalize the learning theory of Connectivism by building and running cMOOCs with a few researchers (Kop 2011; DeWaard et al. 2011) doubling as both designers and facilitators of the MOOCs under study. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a central dynamic of cMOOCs was participant engagement, unpacking the features of disengagement, often referred to as participant lurking, was the key. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little critique of the limits of Connectivism in this first phase of MOOC research; however, Bell (2011) is the exception. He does not believe Connectivism can always be applied successfully to online teaching, and suggests that Connectivism fits some learning environments better than others. Bell rejects Connectivism as a theory, and argues that it is best under- stood as a phenomenon rather than as a full-fledged theory of learning. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, early MOOC research published in scho- larly journals was focused around five key questions aimed at getting MOOCs right: (1) What is the best way to create a high-quality learning environment for autonomous (self-directed) learners? (2) Are the principles of Connectivism getting realized properly and fully in MOOCs? (3) What is the best way to support autonomous learners in MOOCs (acknowledging the evolving roles of learners and educators)? (4) What are the most effective tools and applications for participants? (5) How can MOOCs, influenced by Connectivism, elucidate the complexity of and chaos experienced by higher education at the moment? (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;profound observation, but for this paper, not grounded in results as the authors did not report related analyses.  (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase two: xMOOCs, learning analytics, assessment, and critical discourse 2012–2013 (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez ( 2012) argues that MOOCs need to be differentiated because they may vary in pedagogical under- pinnings. Rodriguez’s empirical research categorizes MOOCs into two main types: cMOOCs and xMOOCs. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an epistemological point of view, Rodriguez argues that cMOOCs are characterized by generative knowledge, whereas xMOOCs are characterized by declarative knowledge. xMOOCs may be more appropriate for learning where there are clear right and wrong answers, but behaviorist pedagogy is ill suited for critical thinking and the practice of creativity (Rodriguez 2013). On his view, the Connectivist paradigm would seem better positioned to take advan- tage of resources and connections available in the networked global learning environment (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay! (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept and practice of ‘openness’ in MOOCS also gets differentiated between the two MOOC formats by Rodriguez (2013). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictive algorithms and adaptive feedback mechanisms hardwired into MOOCs track, record, and analyze every click a student makes to generate data aimed at understanding the ways in which students learn in MOOCs (McKay 2013). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aim of learning analytics is to correlate student characteristics (age, gender, nationality, etc.) with achievement in MOOC courses. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of learning analytics may accelerate further if edX follows through on plans to make their MOOC databases available to other researchers (Reich 2013). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues explored in this corpus include the ways in which MOOCs can be used to substitute for tra- ditional forms of higher education, and made acceptable as a legitimate form of higher education. Assessment typically focuses on accreditation concerns (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accreditation sounds like a more pivotal heading here. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, most in the assessment community welcome MOOCs as ‘an extre- mely positive development’ (Sandeen 2013, 11) and have high expectations that MOOCs will solve a number of social and educational challenges that have worsened over recent decades. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical discourse about MOOCs (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critiques of MOOCs are being articulated that identify problematics related to MOOC epistemology, pedagogy, and cultural hegemony (Rhoads et al. 2013). For example, the problem of epistemology concerns the narrow view of knowledge employed in some MOOCs that view knowledge as a product to be transmitted to anyone with an internet connection and a computer (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;impoverished understanding of knowledge and, moreover, one that does not acknowledge the inherent relationship between power and knowledge. Fou- cault’s insight that power produces knowledge (because power creates norma- tive understandings), permits us to see how MOOCs, given their influence, may promulgate particular interests, and particular expressions of knowledge over other interests or other expressions of knowledge. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhoades encourages consideration of the effects of ‘an Internet-based knowledge system in which certain disciplines and fields of inquiry become [more dominant while other disciplines and fields become] further marginalized by their lack of adherence to this form of knowing’ (Rhoads et al. 2013, 92). In other words, MOOCs may become a tool to further the relatively narrow goals of academic capitalism such that disciplines that serve the dominant economic order are privileged. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of pedagogy refers to a limited understanding of what consti- tutes empowering teaching. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOOCs are also being critiqued for their linguistic representations that are paradoxical and impenetrable. For example, the discourse of MOOCs, which is characterized by a decontextualization of learning and a decontextualization of technology, paradoxically, contains within it both the possibility of (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;democratized education as well as the reproduction of post-colonial forms of knowledge. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we would suggest that there has been a subtle, but significant shift in the ways in which faculty and students are labeled in MOOC discourse. While the title professor is rarely used, the term instructor or facilitator is fre- quently invoked. This semantic shift may express a diminished importance of perceived knowledge, autonomy, and status on the part of the educational leader. Professor and instructor/facilitator are not equivalent terms. Similarly, in the MOOC discourse, students are frequently not called students, but rather referred to as participants, a linguistic modification which would seem to dis- lodge their primary identity as learners. The import of these and other aspects of MOOC discourse require further critical investigation. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase two of MOOC scholarly literature comprises research trajectories aimed in several different directions: (1) efforts toward the establishment of differentiation among MOOCs with regard to pedagogical underpinnings, (2) development of learning analytics based on student characteristics and behaviors that are recursively applied in MOOCs, (3) advancement of forms of assessment that position MOOCs as legitimate pathways of education, and (4) the rise of a criti- cal discourse about MOOCs and their implications for teaching and learning.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Edelson2002&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edelson, D. C. (2002). Design research: What we learn when we engage in design. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 11(1), 105–121. doi:10.1207/S15327809JLS1101_4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important piece on design research articulating different types of theories in DR, as well as &amp;lsquo;twin intentions/goals&amp;rsquo; of advancing both design theories and domain theories in DR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emerging design research paradigm treats design as a strategy for developing and refining theories. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new wave of research, characterized by iterative design and formative research in complex real world settings, has been variously called design experiments (Brown, 1992; Collins, 1992), design research (Cobb, 2001), and development research (Richey &amp;amp; Nelson, 1996; van den Akker, 1999). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional role of design in educational research has been as a strategy for testing theories. Cobb (2001) (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described by this ideal, the role of design in research is to implement a theory so the theory can be evaluated and, if necessary, refined. This role assumes a fully developed theory that maps directly into design. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the recent literature on design experiments and design research, researchers present a different picture of the role of design in their research (Brown, 1992; Kelly &amp;amp; Lesh, 2000; Richey &amp;amp; Nelson, 1996; van den Akker, 1999). They describe a process in which design plays a critical role in the development of theories, not just their evaluation. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these hypotheses and principles are not detailed enough to determine every design decision. In addition, these guiding principles are not followed slavishly if accumulated evidence, specific circumstances, or informed intuition lead the designers to believe they do not apply. In this way, the design researchers proceed through iterative cycles of design and implementation, using each implementation as an opportunity to collect data to inform subsequent design. Through a parallel and retrospective process of reflection upon the design and its outcomes, the design researchers elaborate upon their initial hypotheses and principles, refining, adding, and discarding—gradually knitting together a coherent theory that reflects their understanding of the design experience. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research has led to both applied (design-oriented) theories and basic theories on topics such as cognition, motivation, and social context. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important characteristic of design research is that it eliminates the boundary between design and research. In the traditional theory-testing paradigm, design and research are distinct processes that happen sequentially. Design takes place first as the implementation of the theory, followed by the evaluation-oriented research. The design process is not regarded as an opportunity for learning. In contrast, design research explicitly exploits the design process as an opportunity to advance the researchers understanding of teaching, learning, and educational systems. Design research may still incorporate the same types of outcome-based evaluation that characterize traditional theory testing, however, it recognizes design as an important approach to research in its own right. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I focus on a different question: What kinds of lessons can we learn from the design process in design research? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHAT WE LEARN WHEN WE ENGAGE IN DESIGN (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These opportunities for learning are the direct result of the specific decisions that must be made in the course of a design. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is a sequence of decisions made to balance goals and constraints. In the course of any design, the design team makes three sets of decisions that determine the results of the process. These are decisions about (a) how the design process will proceed, (b) what needs and opportunities the design will address, and &amp;copy; what form the resulting design will take. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in challenging or innovative design, these decisions can be complex, and as Schon pointed out, interdependent, requiring extensive investigation, experimentation, and iterative refinement on the part of the designers. In these cases, the designers inevitably acquire substantial new understanding. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refer to the three collections of decisions that determine a design outcome: the design procedure, the problem analysis, and the design solution. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean to imply that they exist as such in any actual design nor that design is a neat, rational process of making these decisions (Schon, 1990). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the problem analysis may not be constructed before the design solution, as an idealized view might suggest, but may be developed hand-in-hand. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1995, my colleagues and I on the Supportive Inquiry-Based Learning (SIBLE) Project at Northwestern University have been investigating the design and use of software to foster reflection in extended computer-supported inquiry activities (Loh et al., 2001). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been two types of design products from this research. The first is a software environment called the Progress Portfolio. The Portfolio is a database that allows students to record the process and intermediate products of an investigation, and to annotate, organize, and create presentations from those records. The second design product is a set of curriculum units that incorporate the Progress Portfolio as a support for extended investigations involving computer-based inquiry tools. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have found the voice of teachers in this design process to be particularly valuable. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this example of our research on the Progress Portfolio and reflective inquiry has specific elements that reflect the particular goals of the design research program, it is characteristic of design research in general. The research was undertaken with the twin goals of understanding the process of reflective inquiry and developing software tools with practical utility for supporting that process. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THEORIES FROM DESIGN RESEARCH (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the goal of ordinary design is to use the lessons embodied in a design procedure, problem analysis, and design solution to create a successful design product. Design research retains that goal but adds an additional one, the goal of developing useful, generalizable theories. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of these three elements of design, there is a corresponding type of theory that design research can develop. I call (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these three types of theories domain theories, design frameworks, and design methodologies. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain Theories (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A domain theory is the generalization of some portion of a problem analysis. Thus, a domain theory might be about learners and how they learn, teachers and how they teach, or learning environments and how they influence teaching and learning. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is a theory about the world, not a theory about design per se. As such, it is descriptive, not prescriptive. Design research can contribute to two types of domain theories, context theories and outcomes theories. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A context theory characterizes the challenges and opportunities presented by a class of design contexts. For example, in the Progress Portfolio research, we have been developing a context theory that describes the challenges facing students who are engaging in extended scientific investigations for the first time. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An outcomes theory characterizes a set of outcomes associated with some intervention. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design Frameworks (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A design framework is a generalized design solution. Although domain theories are descriptive, design frameworks are prescriptive. They describe the characteristics that a designed artifact must have to achieve a particular set of goals in a particular context. A design framework is a collection of coherent design guidelines for a particular class of design challenge. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van den Akker (1999) also described design frameworks, which he called substantive design principles, as a distinguishing characteristic of design research. Some prominent examples of design frameworks include: anchored instruction (Cognition &amp;amp; Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1997), for creating meaningful problem contexts for extended problem solving; concept-oriented reading instruction (Guthrie &amp;amp; Alao, 1997), for motivating reading instruction through interest; for conducting embedded performance assessments (Sloane, Wilson, &amp;amp; Samson, 1996); and goal-based scenarios (Schank, Fano, Bell, &amp;amp; Jona, &lt;sup&gt;1993&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1994&lt;/sub&gt;), for creating learning-by-doing software and in-person learning environments. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design Methodologies (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A design methodology is a general design procedure. Like a design framework, it is prescriptive. However, a design methodology provides guidelines for the process rather than the product. A design methodology describes (a) a process for achieving a class of designs, (b) the forms of expertise required, and &amp;copy; the roles to be played by the individuals representing those forms of expertise. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van den Akker (1999) uses the term procedural design principles to describe a design methodology. The creation of design methodologies is common in many design fields, including traditional instructional design (e.g., Gagné, Briggs, &amp;amp; Wager, 1992), as a mechanism for ensuring that the design process addresses all the essential issues, includes all of the necessary expertise, and progresses efficiently. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FROM DESIGN TO DESIGN RESEARCH (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be useful, lessons from design must apply beyond the specific context in which they were learned, and they must serve an audience beyond the designers themselves. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I describe four features that distinguish design research from simple design and their benefits for generating valuable research results. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research driven. For a design research program to yield useful results, it must be informed by prior research and guided by research goals. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systematic documentation. Although it is standard procedure in most engineering disciplines to keep comprehensive records of the design process, there are no such conventions in educational design. Therefore, for most educational designs the only record of the process available for analysis is the design itself. To support the retrospective analysis that is an essential element of design research, the design process must be thoroughly and systematically documented. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formative evaluation. In principle, formative evaluation should be a part of all design, but like systematic documentation, it is often left out because of limited time or resources. Formative evaluation is critical in design research because it can identify inadequacies in the problem analysis, the solution, and the design procedure that cannot be exposed through analytical processes alone. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generalization. The final element of design research is the process of generalization. In this process, the designer–researcher expands his or her focus beyond the current design context to look for generalizations to other contexts. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CERTAINTY IN DESIGN RESEARCH (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike results from the theory-testing tradition, the form of design research I have described here does not lead to results with statistically determined confidence levels. This concern highlights two important contrasts between design research and experimental research. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that the objective of design research is different from traditional empirical research. Therefore, they should not be judged by the same standards. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;goal of design research is the generation of new, useful theories. Thus, two important evaluation metrics for design research are novelty and usefulness. A design research program should yield new theories that have utility for resolving important problems. The point of design research is to generate theories that could not be generated by either isolated analysis or traditional empirical approaches. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second contrast between design research and traditional empirical research is their source of strength. Traditional empirical methods gain their strength from statistical sampling. As others have pointed out, the strength of theories developed through design research comes from their explanatory power and their grounding in specific experiences (Cobb, 2001; Steffe &amp;amp; Thompson, 2000). A design research theory is compelling to the extent that it is internally consistent and that it accounts for the issues raised during the design and evaluation process. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, though the point of this article is to highlight their differences, design research is not, in fact, incompatible with traditional outcome-based evaluations. If the nature of any theory is such that a minimum level of certainty is required before it should be applied, then the theory should be evaluated empirically before it is applied, whether the theory was developed through design research or otherwise. My argument for the usefulness of this method of theory development is not intended to question the usefulness of theory-testing methods. Evaluation of theories is essential, particularly as Cobb (2001) pointed out, for convincing audiences such as administrators and policymakers. However, there are two risks for the educational research community of overemphasizing such evaluative research. First, the pressure to evaluate theories could lead to useful theories being discarded because they were evaluated and found wanting before they could be fully developed. Second, overvaluing evaluative research can lead us as a community to overlook the important contribution made by research approaches that develop, rather than evaluate, theories. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHY DESIGN? (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason for engaging in design research is that it provides a productive perspective for theory development. Design provides a productive focus in three ways. First, the practical demands of design require that a theory be fully specified. If a theory is incompletely specified, it cannot meet the needs of designers. Second, the process of design reveals inconsistencies more effectively than analytical processes. The practical process of applying a theory to construct a design naturally exposes inconsistencies because the theory will provide the designer with conflicting guidance. Third, the goal-directed nature of design provides a natural (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;focus for theory development. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second argument for design research is the usefulness of its results. At its heart, education is a design endeavor. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ultimate goal of educational research is the improvement of the education system, then results that speak directly to the design of activities, materials, and systems will be the most useful result. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third argument for engaging in design research is that design research directly involves researchers in the improvement of education. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hogarth, R. M. (2001). Educating intuition. Chicago, Ill.: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hogarth defines intuition as responses ‘reached with little apparent effort, and typically without conscious effort. They involve little or no conscious deliberation’ (p. 14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hogarth pursues the question of whether we can rely upon our intuition. That is, should we let our intuition guide our decision making? The answer that emerges from the book is not a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’. According to Hogarth, the usefulness of intuition depends on several important variables: the quality of feedback, the nature of the environment, and the corpus of knowledge stored in long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many psychologists, Hogarth argues for a separation between the tacit and the deliberate information-processing systems. Intuition is largely a tacit process, but one of the main points of the book is to show us the advantage of using both systems in a synchronized way. While we have little control over tacit learning processes leading to intuitions, the deliberate system can be used to evaluate the nature of the learning process and to discriminate between good and bad intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hogarth distinguishes between two kinds of environments: ‘wicked’ and ‘kind’. Wicked environments provide false or restricted feedback. On the other hand, kind environments offer clear input on whether the choice made was successful or not.
Since the development of our intuitive capacity is strongly connected to a specific area of competence, intuition is also domain-specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based mainly on his dichotomy between wicked and kind environments, and familiarity with scientific methods, he constructs a stepby-step programme, giving recommendations and exercises on howto improve intuition. In essence, hiseducational programme involves applying a somewhat loose scientific method to the areas where we would like to improve our intuition. The aimis to forma new set of valid intuitions in domains that one values. The method of improvement involves analysing the type of environment in which our intuition
was acquired; trying to alter the nature of the environments we are exposed to fromwicked to kind; and identifying whether an intuitive or explicit judgement best fits the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hogarth also tackles another important issue: the connection between emotion and intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intuition rightly deserves to be studied. The book gives a broad and innovative perspective on the subject matter, and the questions posed in it paves the way for further research. It might be difficult to use the book to improve intuitive reasoning, but those that have a theoretical interest in the concept
will find some interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Aaro Toomela has published two papers in which he critically assesses the contents and potential of activity theory. The first one is titled ’Activity theory is a dead end for cultural-historical psychology’ (Toomela, 2000), the second one ’Activity theory is a dead end for methodological thinking in cultural psychology too’ (Toomela, 2008). According to Toomela, there are five fatal faults in activity theory: 1. It relies on unidirectional instead of a dialectical view of culture- individual relationships. 2. It focuses on analyses of activities without taking into account the individual involved in the activity at the same time. 3. It underestimates the role of signs and the importance of focusing on sign meaning. 4. It approaches mind fragmentally, without understanding the holistic nature of mind. 5. It is fundamentally adevelopmental and therefore not appropriate for understanding emerging phenomena, including mind. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the term ’activity theory’, the two books of Leont’ev available in English (although sold out long ago), my book Learning by Expanding (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;article from 1993 by Cole and Engeström. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUNAWAY OBJECTS (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory is a theory of object-driven activity. Objects are concerns, they are generators and foci of attention, motivation, effort and meaning. Through their activities people constantly change and create new objects. The new objects are often not intentional products of a single activity but unintended consequences of multiple activities. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compatible with Popperian worldview (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present era, we need to understand and deal with what I have called ‘runaway objects’ (Engeström, 2008). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Runaway objects have the potential to escalate and expand up to a global scale of influence. They are objects that are poorly under anybody’s control and have far-reaching, unexpected effects. Such objects are often monsters: They seem to have a life of their own that threatens our security and safety in many ways. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Runaway objects are contested objects that generate opposition and controversy. They can also be powerfully emancipatory objects that open up radically new possibilities of development and well-being. The Linux operating system is a well-known example. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leont’ev’s (1978) well-known dictum was that there is no activity without an object. With runaway objects, we may ask: Are there objects without an activity? Whose object is the global warming, for example? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But which activities take responsibility for such a huge object as global warming? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have often used the representation depicted in Figure 2 to capture the challenge of constructing a shared object between two or more activity systems. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2. Two activity systems and a potentially shared object (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with large runaway objects, the challenge would look more like Figure 3. The are typically numerous activity systems focused on or affiliated with the object. But the object is pervasive and its boundaries are hard to draw. Thus, the positions of the activity systems are ambiguous and they often seem to be subsumed to the object rather than in control of it. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3. Large runaway object and activity systems (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various social movements try to do just that. Organic farming, Wikipedia, open models of scientific research and publishing are examples. Most such attempts fail or remain marginal. A crucial question is: What gives some objects inherent drawing power? (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is aligned with promising ideas (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, a benign runaway object must have intrinsic properties that transcend the limits of utilitarian profit motive. In this sense, a benign runaway object is at the boundary between legitimate and illegitimate, sensible and crazy, work and leisure, technology and art. These properties are experienced in acting on and with the object over a long haul, with persistence and patience, oscillating between intensity and withdrawal. The object must yield useful intermediate products, yet remain an incomplete project. The object must be visible, accessible and cumulable - allowing participants to return time and again. There must be effective feedback from and exchange among the participants acting on the object. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, I will discuss the five themes of this book in the light of the challenges posed by the emergence of runaway objects. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNITS OF ANALYSIS: THIRD GENERATION ACTIVITY THEORY, AND BEYOND (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Engeström, 1996). The first generation built on Vygotsky’s notion of mediated action. The second generation built on Leont’ev’s notion of activity system. The third generation, emerging in the past 15 years or so, built on the idea of multiple interacting activity systems focused on a partially shared object. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4. A possible unit of analysis for examining power relations at work (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolf-Michael Roth and his co-authors (2008) call for the inclusion of sensuous aspects of work into the unit of analysis. They name emotions, identity, and ethico-moral dimensions of action as salient sensuous aspects. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing actions together with their social and material consequences is indeed a promising way to approach emotions and other sensuous aspects of activity empirically. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third generation activity theory expands the analysis both up and down, outward and inward. Moving up and outward, it tackles multiple interconnected activity systems with their partially shared and often fragmented objects. Moving down and inward, it tackles issues of subjectivity, experiencing, personal sense, emotion, embodiment, identity, and moral committment. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is a risk that activity theory is split into the study of activity systems, organizations and history on the one hand and subjects, actions and situations on the other hand. This is exactly the kind of split the founders of activity theory set out to overcome. To bridge and integrate the two directions, serious theoretical and empirical efforts are needed. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t this also a reality in CSCL research? different work at diff levels that rarely meet together? (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Russell (in press) suggests ‘genre as social action’ as a unit of analysis complementary to the unit of activity system. For Russell, genres are classifications of artifacts-plus-intentions. They are links between subjects, tools and objects. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities are mediated by multiple modalities, from bodily movements and gestures to pictures, sounds, tools, and all kinds of signs. Written text is but one of the mediational modalities. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;useful; quotable (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is particularly interesting about genres as systems of typified written communication is their mobility and ability to cross organizational boundaries. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third generation activity theory still treats activity systems as reasonably well-bounded, although interlocking and networked, structured units. What goes on between activity systems is processes, such as the flow of rules from management to workers depicted in Figure 4. Processes are commonly assumed to be relatively straightforward, stepwise movements from point A to point B. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make sense. Highlight the importance of the networked viewpoint. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In social production or peer production, the boundaries and structures of activity systems seem to fade away. Processes become simultaneous, multi-directional and often reciprocal. The density and criss-crossing of processes makes the distinction between process and structure somewhat obsolete. The movements of information create textures that are constantly changing but not arbitrary or momentary. The textures are made up of traces or trails which are both cognitive, ‘in the mind’, and material, ‘in the world’ (Cussins, 1992). Wikipedia is a good example in that every alteration of an entry is automatically stored and retrievable for anyone as a cumulative record of previous versions and alterations. So the constantly moving texture is also multi-layered and historically durable. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#quotable  Combining AT with trace data to uncover complex processes. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have characterized these new forms of activity as ‘wildfire activities’ and ‘mycorrhizae activities’ in which interaction takes the shape of knotworking without a single stable center (Engeström, 2006, 2007a, 2008). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity system models are very appropriate for the analysis of such hubs. The challenge is to integrate such analytical tools with new concepts appropriate for the analysis of trails and mycorrhizae. Perhaps this implies a need for a fourth generation of activity theory. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nice. Analyze hubs vs. trails. Pointing to future direction of AT. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEDIATION AND DISCOURSE (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georg Rückriem (in press) argues that activity theory as it presently exists is captive of the historically passing medium of print and writing. For Rückriem, the whole idea of mediation of specific activities by specific tools and signs misses the point of the ongoing societal and cultural transformation engendered by digital media, especially by Web 2.0. Mediation is an issue of the historically leading or dominant media. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is disagree with Rückriem. I see Rückriem’s insistence on the decisive role of media as a particular form of technological determinism. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweeping technological determinism leaves little room for human agency in concrete activities. Focusing on contradictory objects in specific activities calls for new forms of agency. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do also need new concepts to make sense of Web 2.0. For example the notions of ‘open’ and ‘closed’ have great potential although they remain theoretically underdeveloped for the time being. Perhaps more importantly, digital media make very problematic the Vygotskian distinction between tool and sign. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;? (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When categories are imposed upon people they often become iron cages which reduce and rule out possibilities. Such closed ‘stabilization knowledge’ (Engeström, 2007b) is commonly the result of exclusively empirical generalizations taught in schools as authorized ‘correct knowledge’ (Davydov, 1990). On the other hand, existing social categories can also be turned into discursive tools that generate new, emancipatory meanings when blended with new contents and new categories. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;power (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such transitions from ‘stabilization knowledge’ to ‘possibility knowledge’ are at the core of zones of proximal development. The zone is never an empty space to be (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;simply filled with the new. It is inhabited by previous categories that need to be opened up, challenged and transformed. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In radical transformations aimed at the creation of qualitatively new patterns of activity, opening up and blending existing categories are not enough. What is needed is re-mediation by new theoretical concepts that serve as ‘germ cells’ for expanded horizons of possibilities. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXPANSIVE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will suggest a set of potential mechanisms that may stimulate further work in activity- theoretical studies of development. These mechanisms are (1) living movement, (2) breaking away, (3) double stimulation, (4) stabilization, and (5) boundary crossing. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) In the tradition of activity theory, a key metaphor for development is that of a zone. Often the zone of proximal development is interpreted as a vertical step which leads to a higher stage or level. I find it more useful to think of the a zone as a terrain of activity to be dwelled in and (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;explored, not just a stage to be achieved or even a space to be crossed. The zone is explored by moving in it. The movement may take various directions and patterns. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fits well with KB &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;not a vertical step.. but a terrain of activity to be dwelled in and explored&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The dwellers create trails and the intersecting trails gradually lead to an increased capability to move in the zone effectively, independently of the particular location or destination of the subjects. However, the zone is never an empty space to begin with. It has pre- existing dominant trails and boundaries made by others, often with heavy histories and power invested in them. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When new dwellers enter the zone, they both adapt to the dominant trails and struggle to break away from them. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Breaking away from a pre-existing trail or terrain requires expansive agency. This can be achieved by employing external cultural artifacts that are invested with meaning and thus become powerful mediating signs that enable the human being to control his or her behavior from the outside. This is the mechanism of double stimulation. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) New trails and intersections are marked, stabilized and made durable mainly in three ways, namely by means of critical conflicts, by means of authority, and by means of reification into artifacts and conceptualizations. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formation and execution of authority is an obvious source of stability, yet it is an issue barely touched by activity theorists thus far (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Boundary crossing occurs because human beings are involved in multiple activities and have to move between them. A school student must move from home to school to peer culture and back home. Boundary crossing also happens between collective activity systems and organizations, in partnerships and mergers but also in espionage and hostile takeovers. Boundary crossing provides material for double stimulation. It requires negotiation and re-orchestration. It is the most obvious aspect of the horizontal or sideways dimension of development. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;better conceptualize boundary crossing? (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These five mechanisms partly overlap the conceptual framework of expansive learning (Engeström, 1987, 2001). Obviously breaking away is closely connected to facing and resolving contradictions in the different steps of a cycle of expansive learning. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much research and theorizing in developmental psychology that is compatible with the idea of development as ’breaking away and opening up’. What is missing is sustained research programs that would integrate the psychological, institutional and societal aspects of development, not only observationally and retrospectively but also proactively and by means of interventions. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#GAP (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development happens – and should be studied - in the forging of the future in politically and affectively loaded everyday discursive actions, decisions and change efforts. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AGENCY AND COMMUNITY (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authority is foundational for the sustained existence of a community – yet, as Taylor (in press) points out (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my recent book From Teams to Knots (Engeström, 2008), I try to capture something of the historical evolution of authority by means of a condensed table (Table 1). (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1. A historical sketch for conceptualizing authority, agency, and community (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiation is a central coordinating mechanism of the distributed agency required in knotworking within social production. Negotiation is required when the very object of the activity is unstable, resists attempts at control and standardization, and requires rapid integration (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of expertise from various locations and traditions. Negotiation is more than an instrumental search for a singular, isolated compromise decision. It is basically a construction of a negotiated order (Strauss, 1978) in which the participants can pursue their intersecting activities. As Firth (1995, p. 7) put it, “in quite implicit ways, negotiation activity implicates the discourse process itself, revolving around such things as acceptability of categories used to describe objects or concepts, and the veridicality of facts, reasons or assessments.” Putnam (1994, p. 339- 340) takes a step further and points out that successful negotiations tend to transform the dispute, not just reach an instrumental end. “By transforming a dispute, I refer to the extent that a conflict has experienced fundamental changes as a result of the negotiation. Fundamental changes might entail transforming the way individuals conceive of the other person, their relationship, the conflict dilemma, or the social-political situation. &amp;hellip;In the transformative approach, conflicts are no longer problems to be resolved; rather, they are opportunities to create a new social reality, a new negotiated order, a different definition of a relationship, or a transformed situation.” (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;important notes about &lt;strong&gt;negotiation&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social production, such as the Open Source software movement or Wikipedia, is dependent on constant, publicly accessible critical commentary and peer review. When peer review becomes reciprocal, open and continuous, it actually coincides with Putnam’s notion of transformative negotiation. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authority and agency are closely related. In agentic actions, we gain authority and become authors of our lives. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hese challenges may be characterized by means of the notion of relational agency (Edwards, in press). It seems clear that individuals engaged in multi-agency collaboration aimed at the creation of a new activity need to nourish and manifest relational agency in order to achieve, as a collective, the expansive agency necessary for the accomplishment of radical transformations. Relational agency and expansive agency are complementary lenses, one focused on the individual, the other focused on the distributed collective. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;words about &lt;strong&gt;agency&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of agency is still in its infancy. We need to link Il’enkov’s (1977) concept of contradiction with Leont’ev’s (1978) concepts of (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;need, object and motive, and these further with concrete manifestations of will and agentive action. In between, there is space for intermediate concepts such as conflict, envisioning, identification, responsibility, experiencing, and committment. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 implies that we are moving toward increasingly open, amoeba-like communities characterized by multi-directional swarming, weak boundaries and no single stable center. If this is the case, authority and agency may also grow in unexpected ways, as multiple simultaenous and interacting ‘minority influences’ (Moscovici, Mugny &amp;amp; van Avermaet, 2008) from the peripheries rather than as a single dominant majority influence from the center. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTERVENTIONS (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, the United States educational authorities have aggressively launched legislation and national guidelines that define the ‘gold standard’ of educational research. The ‘gold standard’ emphasizes the use of randomized controlled trials, the selection of valid control groups, and ‘scalability’ implying large statistical samples and multiple research sites. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between ‘gold standard’ interventions and design experiments seems to be that the former expects the design of the intervention to be complete at the outset while the latter, recognizing the complexity of educational settings, expects the design to proceed through multiple iterations of ‘refinement’. But even design experiments aim at closure and control. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting attack on DBR. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Intervention is an on-going transformational process that is constantly re-shaped by its own internal organisational and political dynamic and by the specific conditions it encounters or itself creates, including the responses and strategies of local and regional groups who may struggle to define and defend their own social spaces, cultural boundaries and positions within the wider power field.” (Long, 2001, p. 27) (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;applies to learning analytics implementation design (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Crucial to understanding processes of intervention is the need to identify and come to grips with the strategies that local actors devise for dealing with their new intervenors so that they might appropriate, manipulate, subvert or dismember particular interventions.” (Long, 2001, p. 233) (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, resistance and subversion are not accidental disturbances that need to be eliminated. They are essential core ingredients of interventions, and they need to have a prominent place in a viable intervention methodology. Melucci (1996) extends this point into a threefold methodological guideline for intervention research. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What we must recognize is that actors themselves can make sense out of what they are doing, autonomously of any evangelical or manipulative interventions of the researcher. (&amp;hellip;) Secondly, we need to recognize that the researcher-actor relation is itself an object of observation, that it is itself part of the field of action, and thus subject to explicit negotiation and to a contract stipulated between the parties. (&amp;hellip;) Lastly, we must recognize that every research practice which involves intervention in the field of actioncreates an artificial situation which must be explicitly acknowledged. (&amp;hellip;) a capability of metacommunication on the relationship between the observer and the observed must therefore be incorporated into the research framework.” (Melucci, 1996, p. 388-389) (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If agency is not a central concern in the methodology, there is something seriously wrong with it. In educational research, one of the few scholars who have taken this seriously is David Olson. “Research in the human sciences, it may be argued, is less designed to dictate what one does than to provide information that agents, both teachers and students, can use in making informed decision s about what to do in the multiple and varied contexts in which they work.” (Olson , 2004, p. 25) (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully appreciate the radical potential of the methodology of double stimulation, we need to reconstruct Vygotsky’s more general conception of intentionality and agency. Vygotsky described this artifact-mediated nature of intentional action as follows. “The person, using the power of things or stimuli, controls his own behavior through them, grouping them, putting them together, sorting them. In other words, the great uniqueness of the will consists of man having no power over his own behavior other than the power that things have over his behavior. But man subjects to himself the power of things over behavior, makes them serve his own purposes and controls that power as he wants. He changes the environment with the external activity and in this way affects his own behavior, subjecting it to his own authority.” (Vygotsky, 1997b, p. 212) (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic examples of culturally mediated intentionality include devices we construct and use to wake up early in the morning. Vygotsky’s examples of voluntary action are mostly focused on individual actors. This must not be interpreted as neglect of collective intentionality. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervention may be defined simply as “purposeful action by a human agent to create change” (Midgley, 2000, p. 113). This definition makes it clear that the researcher does not have a monopoly over interventions. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#quotable (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory takes the subjects, the participants, the local practitoners, very seriously. But it does not assume that the researcher has a magic formula with which he or she can objectively decipher how the participants understand and judge the unfolding events. Instead, the practitioners themselves are asked to look at, comment on and make sense of the researcher’s initial data and provisional analysis. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first chapter of Thinking and Speech (1987), Vygotsky presented the famous contrast between analysis into elements and analysis into units. “In contrast to the term ‘element’, the term ‘unit’ designates a product of analysis that possesses all the basic characteristics of the whole. The unit is a vital and irreducible part of the whole.” (Vygotsky, 1987b, p. 46) (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expansive learning is above all stepwise expansion of the object. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of expansive learning in complex settings requires a longitudinal intervention approach which may be crystallized in the form of three methodological rules (Engeström, Engeström &amp;amp; Kerosuo, 2003): (1) follow the objects of activity in their temporal and socio-spatial trajectories, (2) give the objects a voice by involving the clients or users in dialogues where the object is made visible, articulated and negotiated, (3) expand the objects by organizing intervention sessions and assignments where the producers and clients construct new shared models, concepts and tools to master their objects. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning Analytics Implementation as an expansive learning experience? (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Change Laboratory sessions are a purposeful blend of elements familiar from existing practices and new elements brought in by the researchers. They are designed to serve as microcosms where potentials of co-configuration and knotworking can be experienced and experimented with. “A microcosm is a social testbench and a spearhead of the coming culturally more advanced form of the activity system. &amp;hellip;the microcosm is supposed to reach within itself and propagate outwards reflective communication while at the same time expanding and therefore eventually dissolving into the whole community of the activity.” (Engeström, 1987, p. 277-278) (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure allows for the collection of rich longitudinal data on the micro-interactions and (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cognitive processes involved in expansive learning as the participants make visible their work, moving between actions and activity, between the past, the present, and the envisioned future. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my tentative conclusion was: ‘We need intermediate runaway objects which are less spectacular and more inviting.’ This is indeed a task for activity theory: Bring together the big and the small, the impossible and the possible, the future-oriented activity-level vision and the here-and-now consequential action. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engeström, Y., &amp;amp; Sannino, A. (2011). Discursive manifestations of contradictions in organizational change efforts: A methodological framework. Journal of Organizational Change Management, 24(3), 368–387. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1108/09534811111132758&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1108/09534811111132758&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This paper clarifies the concept of contradiction in activity theory and introduces a methodology for identifying contradictions reflected in discourse of an organization. &amp;ldquo;Four types of discursive manifestations, namely dilemmas, conflicts, critical conflicts, and double binds, could be effectively identified in the data.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: This introduced approach could be combined with NLP techniques. It seems directly applicable to analysis of promisingness judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new methodological framework for the identification and analysis of different types of discursive manifestations of contradictions. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on the dialectical tradition of cultural-historical activity theory. The methodological framework is developed by means of analyzing the entire transcribed corpus of the discourse conducted in a change laboratory intervention consisting of eight sessions and altogether 189,398 words. Findings – Four types of discursive manifestations, namely dilemmas, conflicts, critical conflicts, and double binds, could be effectively identified in the data. Specific linguistic cues were a useful first level of approaching the different types of manifestations. Critical conflicts and double binds were found to be particularly effective lenses on systemic contradictions. Research limitations/implications – The paper points to the need for theoretical and conceptual rigor in studies using the notion of contradiction. Further empirical testing of the framework is needed and may lead to more refined or alternative categories. Practical implications – Dynamics of different organizational change interventions may be effectively analyzed and compared with the help of the framework. Originality/value – The paper presents an original, empirically-tested methodological framework that may be a valuable resource for analyzes of contradictions driving organizational change. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contradictions are often mentioned as a significant factor behind organizational change. However, the meaning of the term contradiction is commonly left vague and ambiguous. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, in current organizational literature and research, contradictions tend to be watered down in three interrelated ways. First, they are not theoretically defined; instead they are equated with a number of other terms, the exact meaning of which is left vague. Second, contradictions are depicted ahistorically, as a universal feature of organizations, without embedding them in the socioeconomic formation of capitalism. Third, contradictions are commonly presented merely as constellations of competing priorities which need to be combined or balanced. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, we will address the following questions in this paper: how well does our proposed framework of discursive manifestations work in the analysis of data from an organizational change intervention? What kinds of dynamics can be found among the four kinds of discursive manifestations in a longitudinal intervention? How might (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the framework of discursive manifestations serve as a tool for identifying and elaborating organizational contradictions? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialectical contradictions (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Wilde (1989, p. 102) points out, dialectical contradictions are different from the contradictions described in the principle of non-contradiction. Dialectics deals with systems in movement through time. The elements of a dialectical contradiction relate to each other within the moving structure, historically. A dialectical contradiction refers to a unity of opposites, opposite forces or tendencies within such a moving system (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least since Benson’s (1977) and Heydebrand’s (1977) early papers, many if not most of the authors in organizational studies who use the notion of contradiction either explicitly or implicitly refer to dialectical contradictions. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our own concept of contradiction stems from Marxist dialectics (Marx, 1990). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, contradiction is a foundational philosophical concept that should not be equated with paradox, tension, inconsistency, conflict, dilemma or double bind. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, contradictions are historical and must be traced in their real historical development. The primary contradiction of capitalism resides in every commodity, between its use value and (exchange) value (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, developmentally significant contradictions cannot be effectively dealt with merely by combining and balancing competing priorities. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on inner contradiction requires that we analyze the concrete historical system within which the contradiction takes shape; dealing only with external contradictions means escaping this crucial theoretical challenge. For analysis of inner contradictions at the level of organizations, we need a theoretical model of the systemic “anatomy” of organization. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present context, the idea of “thirdness” refers to the generation of novel mediating models, concepts and patterns of activity that go beyond and transcend the available opposing forces or options, pushing the system into a new phase of development. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we will focus on discursive manifestations of contradictions. In organizational life in general, and in change efforts and interventions in particular, contradictions are to an important extent manifested and constructed in patterns of talk and discursive action with the help of which actors try to make sense of, deal with and transform or resolve their contradictions (Engestro ̈m, 1999; Taylor and Van Every, 2011). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discursive manifestations of contradictions (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hatch (1997) analyzes managers’ ironically humorous remarks as constructions of contradiction. She point out that “ironic remarks taken in context allow us to pinpoint aspects of experience that are constructed as contradictory by those producing or responding to the remark” (Hatch, 1997, p. 278). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the framework of activity theory, Engestro ̈m (2008) analyzed discursive disturbances in the work of a television production team specialized in live broadcasts of professional bowling contests. Disturbances were defined as deviations from the normal scripted course of events in the work process, interpreted as symptoms or manifestations of inner contradictions of the activity system in question. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production team used a variety of ways to deal with the disturbances, but not a single instance of open conflict or innovation attempt was found. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis led to the conclusion that a pressing inner contradiction was developing between the expected higher ratings and revenues (demanded new outcome of the activity) on the one hand and the existing stable instruments and rules of the activity (“There is only one way to cover bowling, and what we do is right”) on the other hand. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will discuss four types of discursive manifestations of contradictions, namely dilemmas, conflicts, critical conflicts, and double binds. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dilemmas” are traditionally studied in social psychology as means for understanding processes of decision making, moral reasoning, social representations and ideologies. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dilemma is an expression or exchange of incompatible evaluations, either between people or within the discourse of a single person. It is commonly expressed in the form of hedges and hesitations, such as “on the one hand[&amp;hellip;] on the other hand” and “yes, but”. In ongoing discourse, a dilemma is typically reproduced rather than resolved, often with the help of denial or reformulation. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Conflicts” take the form of resistance, disagreement, argument and criticism. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vuchinich (1990) found five formats of conflict termination, namely submission, dominant third-party intervention, compromise, stand-off, and withdrawal. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Critical conflicts” are situations in which people face inner doubts that paralyze them in front of contradictory motives unsolvable by the subject alone. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Double binds” (Bateson, 1972; Sluzki and Ransom, 1976) are processes in which actors repeatedly face pressing and equally unacceptable alternatives in their activity system, with seemingly no way out. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This impossibility is commonly expressed with the help of desperate rhetorical questions of the type “What can we do?” A double bind is typically a situation which cannot be resolved by an individual alone. Thus, a discursive elaboration of a double bind typically involves an attempt at a transition from the individual “I” to the collective “we”, such as “we must”, “we have to,” loaded with a sense of urgency. The resolution of a double bind requires practical transformative and collective action that goes beyond words but is often accompanied with expressions such as “let us do that”, “we will make it.” (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may think of the analysis of contradictions in discourse data as similar to the peeling of an onion (Figure 1). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manifestation Features Linguistic cues Double bind Facing pressing and equally unacceptable alternatives in an activity system: Resolution: practical transformation (going beyond words) “we”, “us”, “we must”, “we have to” pressing rhetorical questions, expressions of helplessness “let us do that”, “we will make it” Critical conflict Facing contradictory motives in social interaction, feeling violated or guilty Resolution: finding new personal sense and negotiating a new meaning Personal, emotional, moral accounts narrative structure, vivid metaphors “I now realize that[&amp;hellip;]” Conflict Arguing, criticizing Resolution: finding a compromise, submitting to authority or majority “no”, “I disagree”, “this is not true” “yes”, “this I can accept” Dilemma Expression or exchange of incompatible evaluations Resolution: denial, reformulation “on the one hand[&amp;hellip;] on the other hand”; “yes, but” “I didn’t mean that”, “I actually meant” (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table I. Types of discursive manifestations of contradictions (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a high frequency or heavy concentration of some cues in some parts of the discourse may in itself be an indication of something important that is not fully captured by looking only at the actual manifestations. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervention and data (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate and examine the potential of this conceptual framework, we will analyze data from an organizational change intervention conducted in 2008 and 2009 with the management group of municipal home care for the elderly in the City of Helsinki. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort was made in 2008-2009 by means of a change laboratory intervention (Engestro ̈m, 2007). The change laboratory is a method for developing work practices by the practitioners in dialogue and debate among themselves, with their management, with their clients, and – not the least – with the interventionist researchers. It facilitates both intensive, deep transformations and continuous incremental improvement. The idea is to arrange on the shopfloor a room or space in which there is a rich set of representational tools available for analysis of disturbances and for constructing new models of the work activity. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change laboratory sessions began with the viewing and dicussion of a series of videotaped interview excerpts and service encounters from the field. These led to a preliminary attempt to analyze the situation in historical and systemic terms, and to examine critically recent solutions implemented in Sweden and the UK. Starting with the third session, the work was focused on the design of the service palette, first its general structure, then its substantive contents and textual formulations. In the eighth session, the participants discussed the experiences gained in testing the service palette in practice. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linguistic cues for discursive manifestations of contradictions (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify rudimentary linguistic cues in a large corpus of discourse, the cues need to be simple and unambiguous, preferably so that they can be picked up by a computer program, even with the help of the “find” function of MS Word. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dilemmas, we identified the occurrences of the word “but” (in Finnish, “mutta”). For conflits, we identified the occurrences of the word “no” (in Finnish, “ei”); we purposefully excluded all other linguistic forms of the basic negative. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For critical conflicts, we could not determine a rudimentary linquistic cue comparable to “but” and “no”. Critical conflicts are by their very nature personal, and they are expressed by means of emotionally and morally charged accounts. The common linguistic characteristic of such accounts is their narrative structure accompanied by vivid metaphors. There seems to be no simple way to identify them, so we did it by careful reading of the corpus. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For double binds, we identified the occurences of rhetorical questions, that is, questions expressed without expecting an answer. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we first picked up all question marks in the corpus, then read the associated utterances carefully to identify rhetorical questions. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantitative results of this step of our analysis are presented in Table II. In the table, the numbers in parentheses represent the average frequency of the given cue per minute in the data. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, the “but” expressions are consistently fairly frequent across the sessions. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the frequency of negative “no” expressions is consistently high through the sessions, more than twice the relative frequency of the “but” expressions. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, narrative structures peppered with vivid metaphors are extremely rare in the data. This may indicate that this type of management context, combined with the Finnish cultural heritage of not showing one’s emotions, does not favor the explication and elaboration of critical conflicts. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the frequency of rhetorical questions is quite high in the first two sessions but drops radically after that, to practically disappear in the last three sessions. This may indicate a presence of aggravated double binds at the beginning of the process. Conceivably the double binds may have been set aside, perhaps even partially transcended or resolved, in the ensuing design efforts oriented toward the generation of a new pattern of practice. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tentative observations may be solidified or refuted in the next step of the analysis (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dilemmas and conflicts (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 38 dilemmas and 41 conflicts in our data. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dilemmas and conflicts are very commonly associated with whole clusters of several “buts” and “nos”, so a one-to-one correspondence is not to expected. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The occurrence of conflicts confirms the observation tentatively made on the basis of the cues: this intervention was all through a conflictual process. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the repeated dilemmas in our data had to do with the tension between the proclaimed services officially available on the one hand and the actualy limited or missing capacity to provide those services on the other hand. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recurring dilemma was that between the official principle of equally and comprehensively competent home care workforce on the one hand and the realization that many of the home care workers were in fact not competent (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;s excerpt as dilemma, not as a double bind. There were three kinds of conflicts in our data, namely: (1) those between the standpoint of a home care manager and the perceived standpoint of the researchers; (2) those between the standpoints of two or more home care managers; and (3) those between the standpoint of a home care manager and an the perceived standpoint of authorized text, rule or practice. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical conflicts and the primary contradiction in home care (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personal agony stems from the fact that the manager has also nursing competence and understands substantively the medical need of the client, yet as a maneger and “gatekeeper” she cannot accept the need and offer the services the client would want. Thus, the conflict is not between the manager and the client, it is between the manager as nurse and the manager as gatekeeper. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two critical conflicts are both related to the primary contradiction between use value and exchange value in home care work. The foundational purpose and use value of home care is help. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A home care manager is torn between two opposite but mutually dependent motives: to provide help and to contain costs. This primary contradiction is experienced as personal conflict between one’s role as a helper and one’s role as a bureaucrat. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From double binds to secondary contradictions (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the double binds in our data, one core theme stood out above the others. This was the theme of reduction and fragmentation of services to separate minimum chores vs the principle of holistic assessment, care and activation of the client. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, additional three double binds were focused on the closely related theme of making clients passive vs finding, supporting and activating their own resources. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two other themes represented by two double binds each, namely the need for coordination and overview of services vs the prevalence of low-level tasks of “dirty work” in the current practice, and the need to get the client committed to her care vs existing tools that exclude the client from joint negotiation. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core theme of the double binds indicates that secondary contradictions in current home care stem from an object split into two poles. The home care pole consists of fragmented tasks of routine maintenance of the client’s life (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client’s pole consists of the old person’s life resources and threats. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These life needs generally do not fit into the list of necessary tasks to be peformed by the home care worker. In everyday practice, there is a deep gap and constant struggle between the to poles of the object. This contradiction is indicated with the help of the horizontal lightning-shaped arrow in Figure 2. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two poles of the object are mediated by actions. In the discourse of the home care managers, three distinct spheres of action may be identified. The sphere of execution of standard chores dominates home care work. It tends to marginalize and exclude the two other spheres. The first one of these marginalized spheres of action is the coordination of services, the handling of “the totality in a manageable way” in the words of home care manger 7 above. The other one is the activation of clients’ resources. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives rise to these contradictions? Cost containment seems to be the prime source (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the top manager actually spelled out the historical tendency of the neoliberal (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new public management that has strongly influenced the City of Helsinki over the past ten years. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious next step is to conduct comparative analyzes between multiple Change Laboratories or similar organizational change interventions. Especially, the rudimentary linguistic cues, the outermost layer of the methodological onion (Figure 1), may take a quite different shape if a particular social language (Bakhtin, 1982) dominates in an organization. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, analyzes of the dynamic movement and evolution of different types of manifestations and their various combinations or strings over time will benefit from the use and testing of theoretical models of organizational transformation. Within activity theory, the theory of the stepwise cycle of expansive learning (Engestro ̈m, 1987; Engestro ̈m et al., 2007; Engestro ̈m and Sannino, 2010) is an obvious framework for such analyzes. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used critical conflicts and double binds as windows into systemic contradictions in the activity system under scrutiny. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a discursive identification of systemic contradictions is in itself only a hypothesis, to be tested and revised in practical transformative actions. Concrete studies on agentic uses and resolution efforts of contradictions in organizational change efforts are sorely needed. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engeström, Y. (2000). Activity theory as a framework for analyzing and redesigning work. Ergonomics, 43(7), 960–974. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1080/001401300409143&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/001401300409143&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: Engeström expands on the notion of &lt;strong&gt;knotworking&lt;/strong&gt; in this article, in comparison with the 1993 article. This is especially relevant to critical moments of knowledge creation. A bit surprising there has been not much uptake of this concept in KB research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of constant co-configuration is also interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural ±historical activity theory is a new framework aimed at transcending the dichotomies of microand macro-, mental and material, observation and intervention in analysis and redesign of work. The approach distinguishes between short-lived goal-directed actions and durable, object-oriented activity systems. A historically evolving collective activity system, seen in its network relations to other activity systems, is taken as the prime unit of analysis against which scripted strings of goal-directed actions and automatic operations are interpreted. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity systems are driven by communal motives that are often di cult to articulate for individual participants. Activity systems are in constant movement and internally contradictory. Their systemic contradictions, manifested in disturbances and mundane innovations, o er possibilities for expansive developmental transformations. Such transformations proceed through stepwise cycles of expansive learning which begin with actions of questioning the existing standard practice, then proceed to actions of analyzing its contradictions and modelling a vision for its zone of proximal development, then to actions of examining and implementing the new model in practice. New forms of work organization increasingly require negotiated `knotworking’ across boundaries. Correspondingly, expansive learning increasingly involves horizontal widening of collective expertise by means of debating, negotiating and hybridizing di erent perspectives and conceptualizations. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knotworking as an historical challenge (p. 13)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of knot refers to rapidly pulsating, distributed and partially improvized orchestration of collaborative performance between otherwise loosely connected actors and activity systems. A movement of tying, untying and retying together seemingly separate threads of activity characterizes knotworking. The tying and dissolution of a knot of collaborative work is not reducible to any specific individual or fixed organizational entity as the centre of control. The centre does not hold. The locus of initiative changes from moment to moment within a knotworking sequence. Thus, knotworking cannot be adequately analyzed from the point of view of an assumed centre of coordination and control, or as an additive sum of the separate perspectives of individuals or institutions contributing to it. The unstable knot itself needs to be made the focus of analysis. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise and proliferation of knotworking is associated with ongoing historical changes in work and organizations. Victor and Boynton’s (1998) concept of coconfiguration is particularly interesting from the point of view of knotworking. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But co-configuration work takes this relationship up one levelÐit brings the value of an intelligent and &lt;code&gt;adapting’ product. The company then continues to work with this customer±product pair to make the product more responsive to each user. In this way, the customisation work becomes continuous. Unlike previous work, co-configuration never results in a&lt;/code&gt;finished’ product. Instead, a living, growing network develops between customer, product, and company. (Victor and Boynton 1998: 195) (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of co-configuration is `customer intelligence’. To achieve it, a company will have continuously to configure its products and services in interaction with the customer. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, knotworking may be seen as the emerging interactional core of co-configuration. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, there are six criteria of co-configuration: (1) adaptive product or service; (2) continuous relationship between customer, product/service and company; (3) ongoing configuration or customization; (4) active customer involvement; (5) multiple collaborating producers; and (6) mutual learning from interactions between the parties involved. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knotworking is related to the rise of temporary groups (Meyerson et al. 1996). However, temporary groups are understood as one-time formations created for the purpose of completing a task with a clear deadline. Knotworking, on the contrary, is a longitudinal process in which knots are formed, dissolved, and re-formed as the object is co-configured time and time again, typically with no clear deadline or fixed end point. In temporary groups, the centre still firmly rests in a definable, bounded group. In knotworking, the centre does not hold. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @cheung2008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheung, K. K. F., Jong, M. S. Y., Lee, F. L., Lee, J. H. M., Luk, E. T. H., Shang, J., &amp;amp; Wong, M. K. H. (2008). FARMTASIA: an online game-based learning environment based on the VISOLE pedagogy. Virtual Reality, 12(1), 17–25. doi:10.1007/s10055-008-0084-z&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clippings&#34;&gt;Clippings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual interactive student-oriented learning environment (VISOLE) is a game-based constructivist pedagogical approach that encompasses the creation of an online interactive world modeled upon a set of interdisciplinary domains, in which students participate as ‘‘citizens’’ to take part cooperatively and competitively in shaping the development of the virtual world as a means to construct their knowledge and skills. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FARMTASIA is the first online game designed using the VISOLE philosophy, encompassing the subject areas of biology, government, economics, technology, production system and natural environment. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to our exploratory educational study, we show evidentially that positive perceptions and an advancement of subjectspecific and interdisciplinary knowledge appeared among the students who participated in VISOLE learning with FARMTASIA (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly speaking, the VISOLE approach encompasses the creation of an online interactive world modeled upon a set of interdisciplinary domains, in which students participate as ‘‘citizens’’ to take part in shaping the development of this virtual world. With teachers’ facilitation (scaffolding and (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;debriefing) and a sophisticated multi-learner game-play simulation context, the students are empowered to cooperatively and competitively learn from their near real-life experiences in the virtual world (the game), and finally construct knowledge and skills by their own. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distinguished features of FARMTASIA include realistic simulation models developed with the help of subject domain experts, mini-games, interaction among players, virtual synchronization of asynchronous game play, and full logging of user behavior to facilitate case studies and analyses sessions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 A closer look on VISOLE (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VISOLE is a three-phase pedagogical approach with a combination of Multi-disciplinary Scaffolding (Phase 1), Online Game-based Learning (Phase 2) and Just-in-time and Summative Debriefing (Phase 3). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of Phase 3 interleaves with activities in Phase 2. In this phase, the teacher(s) closely monitor the progress of the students’ development of the virtual world in the backend, and look for and try to act on ‘‘debriefable’’ moments to ‘‘lift’’ the students out of particular situations in the game and empower them to reflect and generalize their gained knowledge and skills, that is, to transform their game-play experiences into learning experiences. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘‘Wise Genie’’, one of the game characters who will occasionally appear in the virtual world to give some advice or hints (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, every student (hereafter interchangeable with the term ‘‘player’’) acts as a ‘‘farm manager’’ to individually run a farm, which is composed of a cropland, an orchard as well as a rangeland. Each of them competes for financial gain and reputation with other three ‘‘farm managers’’ (players) who are also at the same time running their own farm somewhere nearby in the virtual world (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of FARMTASIA follows three vital principles. The first one is to make the game as realistic as possible so that players can learn in a near-real life environment that enables situated learning (Lave and Wenger 1991) to occur. The second one is to inject challenge, curiosity, control, fantasy, competition, cooperation and recognition elements to arouse the players’ intrinsic motivation (Malone 1980) so that they will go on to constructively learn and acquire various knowledge and skills with the game. The third one is to make easy for teacher(s) to conduct various VISOLE facilitation tasks. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the game-play period (around 2 weeks), the players have to formulate various investment and operational strategies to output both high quality and quantity farm products to the market in order to make money. Nevertheless, the richest may not be the final winner, as the final reputation of the players in the virtual world, governed by good public policies, is also a vital and critical judging criterion, which is determined upon their practices on sustainable development and environmental protection. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Special game-play design and features in FARMTASIA (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dilemmas (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1.1 Scientific models (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geographical model is in charge of four-seasoned climate, which alternates temperature, rainfall, wind-speed and humidity against a year in the virtual world (see Fig. 3). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;always keep an eye on the context (temperature and rainfall etc.) in the virtual world in order to make just-in-time actions (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both botanical and biological models are adopted in simulating how the crops and livestock evolve in the game (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sudden events will randomly happen in the virtual world (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an economic model is also adopted to deal with the exchange of toils, farm products and revenues in the game. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1.3 Mini-games (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mini-games serve for two main purposes. The first one is to make FARMTASIA to be more fun, pleasurable and challenging; the second one is that the players’ performance in the mini-games will contribute to how well the relevant activities are carried out in their own farm. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1.4 Game-play control (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplicity (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mini-games are competitive in nature, in which players compete for better scores. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2 Teacher console in FARMTASIA (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the VISOLE teacher can view the proceedings of each student in the virtual world by making use of the teacher console which re-transforms the gameplay logging stored in the game server into students’ gameplay histories and presents them in Gantt chart format, see Fig. 8a. By clicking on the ‘‘blocks’’ appeared in the Gantt chart, the teacher can entirely replay all students’ actions in the game even in the form of ‘‘video’’ playback, see Fig. 8b. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 An exploratory study on FARMTASIA (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.1 Students’ subject-specific and interdisciplinary knowledge (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2 Students’ perceptions (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;students were generally positive towards this game. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly, this paper trim the widely used AACES from 22 items to 9 items and further checked the revised instrument&amp;rsquo;s validity and reliability and predictive strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study subjects the AACES to a rigorous examination. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a three-dimensional structure of attitude with three factors, Enjoyment of Learning, Perceived Importance, and Intrinsic Value. A substantial number of the AACES items were judged extraneous, and a nine-item Revised Attitude Toward Continuing Education Scale (RAACES) was constructed. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitudes Toward Continuing Education Scale (AACES) (Darkenwald &amp;amp; Hayes, 1988; Hayes &amp;amp; Darkenwald, 1990) is one instrument purported to be a valid and reliable scale to measure attitudes toward adult education (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the AACES was introduced more than 10 years ago, a rigorous and independent replication and assessment of the scale’s factor structure and psychometric properties has not been published. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;criticized by Schwab (1980) more than two decades ago, the paucity of welldeveloped psychometric instruments frequently leads researchers to use whatever instruments are available. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of the AACES drew on Rokeach’s (1968; Rokeach &amp;amp; Kliejunas, 1972) two-attitude theory of attitude toward a psychological object and attitude toward the situation in which the object is encountered (Darkenwald &amp;amp; Hayes, 1988; Hayes &amp;amp; Darkenwald, 1990). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first analysis, published in IJLE (Darkenwald &amp;amp; Hayes, 1988), the authors reported a factor analysis that yielded five factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 prior to rotation. Because the first unrotated factor with an eigenvalue of 7.2 was dominant, the authors declared the scale to be unidimensional. They further stated, “To double-check the foregoing evidence of unidimensionality, two, three, four and five factor oblique and orthogonal factor analyses were computed. None yielded conceptually meaningful results” (p. 199). In summary, the authors reported that their analyses failed to confirm Rokeach’s (1968; Rokeach &amp;amp; Kliejunas, 1972) theoretical two-attitude model and attitude toward continuing education was unifactorial. Unfortunately, the authors and the editors and reviewers of IJLE failed to recognize that the reported factor analysis results actually confirmed AACES to be multifactorial. In contradiction with recognized interpretations of eigenvalues (see, e.g., Comrey &amp;amp; Lee, 1992), the authors interpreted the presence of a number of eigenvalues greater than 1.0 to be inconsequential when they claimed that the scale was one-dimensional (p. 202). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their second report, published in AEQ, Hayes and Darkenwald (1990) (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-factor solution thought to best fit the data was arrived at by orthogonal rotation, and the factors were labeled Enjoyment of Learning Activities (7 items), Importance of Adult Education (9 items), and Intrinsic Value of Adult Education (5 items). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both published reports on the development of AACES, the authors ignored prior evidence indicating that attitudes toward adult education were most likely multifactorial. The widely published work of Boshier (see Boshier &amp;amp; Collins, 1985) on the EPS, which has its origins in Houle’s (1961) hypothesized tripartite conceptualization of motivational orientations (the same research cited by the developers of AACES to ground their research in existing adult education literature), confirms a six-factor model of motivational orientations. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study incorporated two objectives. The first objective was to implement a rigoroustestoftheAACES’factorstructureusingtheconfirmatoryfactoryanalytic technique developed by Jöreskog (1969). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second objective was to examine the predictive validity of the AACES using the more powerful approach of structural equation modeling. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were 458 adult learners enrolled in a variety of adult education programs offered by a western Canadian university and other adult education agencies (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESULTS (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measurement Models for Attitudes and Participation Behavior (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results obtained indicated that psychometric refinement of the three subscales was needed with regard to factor content and the number of items. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it was concluded that the five-item index formed an adequate measurement model for a single construct of adult education participation behavior. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having established the superiority of the three-factor model, the analysis focused on a search for an adequate measurement model for the construct of attitude within the AACES item pool. In modifying the AACES, items were deleted one at a time based on modification indices (MI) that pointed to individual items having either a complex loading pattern or being correlated with measurement error. An item with a complex loading pattern, or a passenger item, is an item with a high factor loading on the primary factor as well as a high loading on at least one other secondary factor. Items were discarded from the scale one at time, with the item having the largest MI on at least one secondary factor being selected for deletion. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, more than 90% of attitudinal variations measured on the modified scale could be explained by the three-factor structure of attitudes generated from the nine-item instrument. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PREDICTIVEVALIDITYOFTHERAACES (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess the predictive validity of the three-attitudinal constructs of the RAACES, we used a structural equation modeling technique to examine the relationship between attitudes and participation behavior (PBI). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the three attitude factors, we think that Enjoyment of Learning reflects an affect component, whereas Perceived Importance and Intrinsic Value of Adult Education reflect beliefs and values held about adult education (Hayes &amp;amp; Darkenwald, 1990). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 presents this causal model of attitude and participation behavior with estimates of the structural coefficients for the overall sample. All the path coefficients obtained were statistically significant (p &amp;lt; .05), and the fit of the model to the data was acceptable, χ2(69) = 592.39, p &amp;lt; .01; GFI = .86, CFI = .71. Almost 90% of the variance and covariance of the measures on attitude and participation were explained by the model. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results also indicate that participation in adult education functioned effectively as a construct, with 14% of its variance attributable to the assessed attitudes toward continuing education. Participation behavior was directly influenced by Enjoyment of Learning (.37), which in turn was almost equally affected by Perceived Importance and Intrinsic Value of Adult Education, their path coefficients being .39 and .36, respectively. Although the impact of Intrinsic Value on Enjoyment of Learning was moderate (.36), it had a much stronger influence on Importance of Adult Education (.74). In summary, the results obtained demonstrate that all three factors of adult attitude toward continuing education have significant and interpretable influences on participation behavior. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APPENDIX&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revised Adult Attitudes Toward Continuing Education Scale Items&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing education is mostly for people with little else to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I dislike studying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful people do not need continuing education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am fed up with teachers and classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money spent on continuing education for employees is money well spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my education would make me feel better about myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoy educational activities that allow me to learn with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing education is an important way to help people cope with changes in their lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing education helps people make better use of their lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoyment of learning: 2, 4, 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance: 3, 1, 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrinsic value: 9, 6, 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People commonly misinterpret social learning analytics as social network analysis. This article addresses this misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the perspective from that of the institution gathering data about learners in order to inform organisational objectives, to that of providing new tools for the learner and teacher, drawing on experience from the learning sciences with the intention of understanding and optimizing not only learning but also the environments in which it takes place. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we propose that Social Learning Analytics (SLA) can be usefully thought of as a subset of learning analytics, which draws on the substantial body of work evidencing that new skills and ideas are not solely individual achievements, but are developed, carried forward, and passed on through interaction and collaboration. A socio-cultural strand of educational research demonstrates how language is itself one of the primary tools through which learners construct meaning, and its use is influenced by the aims, feelings and relationships of their users, all of which shift according to context &lt;a href=&#34;as will be seen, discourse and context are two foci of the SLA we propose&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. Another strand of research emphasises that learning cannot be understood by focusing solely on the cognition, development or behaviour of individual learners; neither can it be understood without reference to its situated nature [4, 5]. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this paper cites numerous examples of related work in context. Instead, it groups a range of pre-existing and new tools and approaches to form the basis of a coherent set. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4 Innovationdependsonsocialconnection (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a succinct synthesis of the literature, Hagel, et al. [13] argue that social learning is the only way in which organisations can cope with the unprecedented turbulence they now face. They invoke the concept of ‘pull’ as an umbrella term to signal some fundamental shifts in the ways in which we catalyse learning and innovation, and argue that the world is changing so rapidly that useful knowledge/understanding (in contrast to data or information) is rarely well codified, indexed or formalized, while socially transmitted knowledge is growing in importance as a source of timely, trustworthy insight. This leads them to highlight quality of interpersonal relationships, tacit knowing, discourse and personal passion as key capacities to foster, as we move in business from mere transactional relationships, to building and sustaining more meaningful relationships. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Social learning network analytics (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social network analysis investigates ties, relations, roles and network formations, and a social learning network analysis is concerned with how these are developed and maintained to support learning [15]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now introduce five categories of analytic whose foci are driven by the implications of the drivers reviewed above. The first two categories are inherently social, while the other three can be ‘socialized’, ie. usefully applied in social settings: (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• social network analytics — interpersonal relationships define social platforms • discourse analytics —language is a primary tool for knowledge negotiation and construction • content analytics — user-generated content is one of the defining characteristics of Web 2.0 • disposition analytics — intrinsic motivation to learn is a defining feature of online social media, and lies at the heart of engaged learning, and innovation • context analytics — mobile computing is transforming access to both people and content. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2 Social learning discourse analytics (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational success and failure have been related to the quality of learners’ educational dialogue [24]. Social learning discourse analytics can be employed to analyse, and potentially to influence, dialogue quality. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercer and his colleagues distinguished three social modes of thinking used by groups of learners in face-to-face environments: disputational, cumulative and exploratory talk [25-28]. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics researchers have built on this work to provide insight into textual discourse in online learning [29, 30], providing a bridge to the world of social learning analytics. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2 Social learning disposition analytics (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learners who are prepared to learn and are open to new ideas have the potential to make good use of these resources and tools. A well established research programme has identified, theoretically, empirically and statistically, a seven-dimensional model of learning dispositions, termed ‘learning power’ [38]. These dispositions can be used to render visible the complex mixture of experience, motivation and intelligences that make up an individual’s capacity for lifelong learning and influence responses to learning opportunities &lt;a href=&#34;p. 4&#34;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOCIALIZED LEARNING ANALYTICS (p. 4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1 Sociallearningcontentanalytics (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Content analytics’ is used here as a broad heading for the various automated methods used to examine, index and filter online media assets for learners. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These analytics may be used to provide recommendations of resources tailored to the needs of an individual or a group of learners. This is a very fast-moving field, and the state of the art in textual and video information retrieval tools is displayed annually in competitions such as the Text Retrieval Conference [see 33 for a review]. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a social learning perspective, three elements of disposition analytics are particularly important. Firstly, they draw learners’ attention to the importance of relationships and interdependence as one of the seven key learning dispositions. Secondly, they can be used to support learners as they reflect on their ways of (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;perceiving, processing and reacting to learning interactions. Finally, they play a central role in an extended mentoring relationship. This type of relationship has an important role in online social learning, especially when learning is informal and not teacher-led. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.3 Sociallearningcontextanalytics (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Context analytics’ are the analytic tools that expose, make use of or seek to understand these contexts. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.1 Implementingsociallearningnetwork analytics (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• identifying disconnected students • identifying key information brokers within a class • indicating the extent to which a learning community is developing within a class &lt;a href=&#34;p. 5&#34;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social learning network feedback for a group or moderator will seek to use what is known about effective group structure and dynamics and feed this back for reflection [51]. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2 Implementing social learning discourse analytics (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key characteristics of exploratory dialogue include challenge, evaluation, reasoning and extension. Initial research suggests that these are signaled in forum interaction by key words and phrases [29]. For example: ‘alternative’, ‘but if’ and ‘I don’t believe’ suggest challenge; ‘good point’, ‘important’ and ‘how much’ suggest evaluation; ‘next step’, ‘it’s like’ and ‘relates to’ suggest extension, and ‘does that mean’, ‘my understanding’ and ‘take your point’ suggest reasoning. Figure 1 shows how a visualization of these elements of dialogue could be presented to learners, together with recommendations. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CONCLUSION Social learning analytics make use of data generated by learners’ online activity in order to identify behaviours and patterns within the learning environment that signify effective process. The intention is to make these visible to learners, to learning groups and to teachers, together with recommendations that spark and support learning. In order to do this, these analytics make use of data generated when learners are socially engaged. This engagement includes both direct interaction – particularly dialogue – and indirect interaction, when learners leave behind ratings, recommendations or other activity traces that can influence the actions of others. Another important source of data consists of users’ responses to these analytics and their associated visualizations and recommendations (p. 9)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article examines five common misunderstandings about case-study research: (a) theoretical knowledge is more valuable than practical knowledge; (b) one cannot generalize from a single case, therefore, the single-case study cannot contribute to scientific development; &amp;copy; the case study is most useful for generating hypotheses, whereas other methods are more suitable for hypotheses testing and theory building; (d) the case study contains a bias toward verification; and (e) it is often difficult to summarize specific case stud- ies. This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of a greater number of good case studies. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conventional Wisdom About Case-Study Research (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case Study. The detailed examination of a single example of a class of phe- nomena, a case study cannot provide reliable information about the broader class, but it may be useful in the preliminary stages of an investigation since it provides hypotheses, which may be tested systematically with a larger number of cases. (Abercrombie, Hill, &amp;amp; Turner, 1984, p. 34)1 This description is indicative of the conventional wisdom of case-study research, which if not directly wrong, is so oversimplified as to be grossly misleading. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the conventional view, a case and a case study cannot be of value in and of themselves; they need to be linked to hypotheses, following the well-known hypothetico-deductive model of explanation. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually found, with the help of Campbell’s later works (e.g., Campbell, 1975) and other works like them, that the problems with the conventional wisdom about case-study research can be summarized in five misunderstandings or oversimplifica- tions about the nature of such research: Misunderstanding 1: General, theoretical (context-independent) knowledge is more valuable than concrete, practical (context-dependent) knowledge. Misunderstanding 2: One cannot generalize on the basis of an individual case; therefore, the case study cannot contribute to scientific development. Misunderstanding 3: The case study is most useful for generating hypotheses; that is, in the first stage of a total research process, whereas other methods are more suitable for hypotheses testing and theory building. Misunderstanding 4: The case study contains a bias toward verification, that is, a tendency to confirm the researcher’s preconceived notions. Misunderstanding 5: It is often difficult to summarize and develop general propo- sitions and theories on the basis of specific case studies. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These five misunderstandings indicate that it is theory, reliability, and valid- ity that are at issue; in other words, the very status of the case study as a scien- tific method. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Role of Cases in Human Learning (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phenomenological studies of human learning indicate that for adults, there exists a qualitative leap in their learning process from the rule-governed use of analytical rationality in beginners to the fluid performance of tacit skills in what Pierre Bourdieu (1977) called virtuosos and Hubert Dreyfus and Stuart Dreyfus (1986) called true human experts. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common to all experts, however, is that they operate on the basis of inti- mate knowledge of several thousand concrete cases in their areas of exper- tise. Context-dependent knowledge and experience are at the very heart of expert activity. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only because of experience with cases that one can at all move from being a beginner to being an expert. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured if it is good enough for Harvard, it is good enough for me, and I suggest others might reason like this, including whole institutions of learning. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this idea conventional too? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concrete experiences can be achieved via continued proxim- ity to the studied reality and via feedback from those under study. Great dis- tance to the object of study and lack of feedback easily lead to a stultified learning process, which in research can lead to ritual academic blind alleys, where the effect and usefulness of research becomes unclear and untested. As a research method, the case study can be an effective remedy against this tendency. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second main point in connection with the learning process is that there does not and probably cannot exist predictive theory in social science. Social science has not succeeded in producing general, context-independent theory (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for predictive theory, universals, and scientism, the study of human affairs is, thus, at an eternal beginning. In essence, we have only specific cases and context-dependent knowledge. The first of the five misunderstand- ings about the case study—that general, theoretical (context-independent) knowledge is more valuable than concrete, practical (context-dependent) knowledge—can therefore be revised as follows: Predictive theories and universals cannot be found in the study of human affairs. Concrete, context-dependent knowledge is, therefore, more valuable than the vain search for predictive theories and universals. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases as “Black Swans” (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view that one cannot generalize on the basis of a single case is usually considered to be devastating to the case study as a scientific method. This sec- ond misunderstanding about the case study is typical among proponents of the natural science ideal within the social sciences. Yet even researchers who are not normally associated with this ideal may be found to have this view- point. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on the case one is speaking of and how it is chosen. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, Galileo’s experimentalism did not involve a large random sample of trials of objects falling from a wide range of randomly selected heights under varying wind conditions and so on, as would be demanded by the thinking of the early Campbell and Giddens. Rather, it was a matter of a single experiment, that is, a case study, if any experiment was conducted at all. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards the relationship between case studies, large samples, and dis- coveries, W. I. B. Beveridge (as quoted in Kuper &amp;amp; Kuper, 1985) observed immediately prior to the breakthrough of the quantitative revolution in the social sciences: “More discoveries have arisen from intense observation than from statistics applied to large groups” (p. 95). This does not mean that the case study is always appropriate or relevant as a research method or that large random samples are without value (see also the Conclusion section below). The choice of method should clearly depend on the problem under study and its circumstances. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be mentioned that formal generalization, whether on the basis of large samples or single cases, is considerably overrated as the main source of scientific progress. Economist Mark Blaug (1980)—a self- declared adherent to the hypothetico-deductive model of science—has demonstrated that although economists typically pay lip service to the hypothetico-deductive model and to generalization, they rarely practice what they preach in actual research. More generally, Thomas Kuhn (1987) has shown that the most important precondition for science is that researchers possess a wide range of practical skills for carrying out scientific work. Gen- eralization is just one of these. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wissenschaft) means literally “to gain knowledge.” (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting! Connecting with our discussions earlier on what does it mean to be scientific. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balanced view of the role of the case study in attempting to generalize by testing hypotheses has been formulated by Eckstein (1975): Comparative and case studies are alternative means to the end of testing theo- ries, choices between which must be largely governed by arbitrary or practi- cal, rather than logical, considerations (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eckstein here used the term theory in its “hard” sense, that is, comprising explanation and prediction. This makes Eckstein’s dismissal of the view that case studies cannot be used for testing theories or for generalization stronger than my own view, which is here restricted to the testing of theory in the “soft” sense, that is, testing propositions or hypotheses. Eckstein showed that if predictive theories would exist in social science, then the case study could be used to test these theories just as well as other methods. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popper himself used the now famous example “all swans are white” and proposed that just one observation of a single black swan would falsify this proposition and in this way have general significance and stimulate further investigations and theory building. The case study is well suited for identifying “black swans” because of its in-depth approach: What appears to be “white” often turns out on closer examination to be “black.” (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can correct the second misun - derstanding—that one cannot generalize on the basis of a single case and that the case study cannot contribute to scientific development—so that it now reads, One can often generalize on the basis of a single case, and the case study may be central to scientific development via generalization as supplement or alter- native to other methods. But formal generalization is overvalued as a source of scientific development, whereas “the force of example” is underestimated. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategies for Case Selection (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because this misunderstanding has been revised as above, we can now correct the third misunderstanding as follows: The case study is useful for both generating and testing of hypotheses but is not limited to these research activities alone. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 summarizes various forms of sampling. The extreme case can be well-suited for getting a point across in an especially dramatic way, which often occurs for well-known case studies such as Freud’s (2003) “Wolf- Man” and Foucault’s (1979) “Panopticon.” In contrast, a critical case can be defined as having strategic importance in relation to the general problem. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases of the “most likely” type are especially well suited to falsification of propositions, whereas “least likely” cases are most appropriate to tests of verification. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final strategy for the selection of cases is choice of the paradigmatic case. Kuhn (1987) has shown that the basic skills, or background practices, of natural scientists are organized in terms of “exemplars,” the role of which can be studied by historians of science. In a similar manner, scholars such as Clifford Geertz and Michel Foucault have often organized their research on specific cultural paradigms: A paradigm for Geertz (1973) lay, for instance, in the “deep play” of the Balinese cockfight, whereas for Foucault (1979), European prisons and the “Panopticon” are examples. Both instances are examples of paradigmatic cases, that is, cases that highlight more general characteristics of the societies in question. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, concerning considerations of strategy in the choice of cases, it should be mentioned that the various strategies of selection are not necessar- ily mutually exclusive. For example, a case can be simultaneously extreme, critical, and paradigmatic (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do Case Studies Contain a Subjective Bias? (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Bacon (1853) saw this bias toward verification not simply as a phenomenon related to the case study in particular but also as a fundamental human characteristic. Bacon expressed it like this, The human understanding from its peculiar nature, easily supposes a greater degree of order and equality in things than it really finds. When any proposition has been laid down, the human understanding forces everything else to add fresh support and confirmation. It is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human understanding to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than negatives. (p. xlvi) (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacon certainly touched on a fundamental problem here, a problem that all researchers must deal with in some way. Charles Darwin (1958), in his auto- biography, described the method he developed to avoid the bias toward verification: I had &amp;hellip; during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable ones. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do the author&amp;rsquo;s arguments run such risks as well? Enough understanding of bigger N studies? (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are often seen as less rigorous than are quantitative, hypothetico-deductive methods. Even if such criticism is useful, because it sensitizes us to an impor- tant issue, experienced case researchers cannot help but see the critique as demonstrating a lack of knowledge of what is involved in case-study research. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;case study has its own rigor, different to be sure, but no less strict than the rigor of quantitative methods. The advantage of the case study is that it can “close in” on real-life situations and test views directly in relation to phenom- ena as they unfold in practice. According to Campbell (1975), Ragin (1992), Geertz (1995), Wieviorka (1992), Flyvbjerg (1998, 2001), and others, researchers who have conducted intensive, in-depth case studies typically report that their preconceived views, assumptions, concepts, and hypotheses were wrong and that the case material has compelled them to revise their hypotheses on essential points. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geertz (1995) said about the fieldwork involved in most in-depth case studies that “The Field” itself is a “powerful disciplinary force: assertive, demanding, even coercive” (p. 119). (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the experiences cited above, it is falsification, not verification, that characterizes the case study. Moreover, the question of subjectivism and bias toward verification applies to all methods, not just to the case study and other qualitative methods. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one, thus, assumes that the goal of the researcher’s work is to under- stand and learn about the phenomena being studied, then research is simply a form of learning. If one assumes that research, like other learning processes, can be described by the phenomenology for human learning, it then becomes clear that the most advanced form of understanding is achieved when researchers place themselves within the context being studied. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point of view, the proximity to reality, which the case study entails, and the learning process that it generates for the researcher will often consti- tute a prerequisite for advanced understanding. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case study contains no greater bias toward verification of the researcher’s preconceived notions than other methods of inquiry. On the contrary, experi- ence indicates that the case study contains a greater bias toward falsification of preconceived notions than toward verification. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Irreducible Quality of Good Case Narratives (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case studies often contain a substantial element of narrative. Good narra- tives typically approach the complexities and contradictions of real life. Accordingly, such narratives may be difficult or impossible to summarize into neat scientific formulae, general propositions, and theories (Benhabib, 1990; Mitchell &amp;amp; Charmaz, 1996; Roth, 1989; Rouse, 1990; White, 1990). This tends to be seen by critics of the case study as a drawback. To the case- study researcher, however, a particularly “thick” and hard-to-summarize nar- rative is not a problem. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa Peattie (2001) explicitly warned against summarizing dense case studies: “It is simply that the very value of the case study, the contextual and interpenetrating nature of forces, is lost when one tries to sum up in large and mutually exclusive concepts” (p. 260). (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite of summing up and “closing” a case study is to keep it open. Here I have found the following two strategies to work particularly well in ensuring such openness. First, when writing up a case study, I demur from the role of omniscient narrator and summarizer. Instead, I tell the story in its diversity, allowing the story to unfold from the many-sided, complex, and sometimes conflicting stories that the actors in the case have told me. Sec- ond, I avoid linking the case with the theories of any one academic special- ization. Instead, I relate the case to broader philosophical positions that cut across specializations. In this way, I try to leave scope for readers of different backgrounds to make different interpretations and draw diverse conclusions regarding the question of what the case is a case of. The goal is not to make the case study be all things to all people. The goal is to allow the study to be different things to different people. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein shared this skepticism. According to Gasking and Jackson (1967), Wittgenstein used the following metaphor when he described his use of the case-study approach in philosophy: In teaching you philosophy I’m like a guide showing you how to find your way round London. I have to take you through the city from north to south, from east to west, from Euston to the embankment and from Piccadilly to the Marble Arch. After I have taken you many journeys through the city, in all sorts of directions, we shall have passed through any given street a number of times— each time traversing the street as part of a different journey. At the end of this you will know London; you will be able to find your way about like a born Lon- doner. Of course, a good guide will take you through the more important streets more often than he takes you down side streets; a bad guide will do the oppo- site. In philosophy I’m a rather bad guide. (p. 51) (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach implies exploring phenomena firsthand instead of reading maps of them. Actual practices are studied before their rules, and one is not satisfied by learning about only those parts of practices that are open to public scrutiny; what Erving Goffman (1963) called the “backstage” of social phe- nomena must be investigated, too, like the side streets that Wittgenstein talked about. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labov and Waletzky (1966) wrote that when a good narrative is finished, “it should be unthinkable for a bystander to say, ‘So what?’” (pp. 37-39). Every good narrator is continually warding off this question. A narrative that lacks a moral that can be independently and briefly stated, is not necessarily pointless. And a narrative is not successful just because it allows a brief moral. A successful narrative does not allow the question to be raised at all. The narrative has already supplied the answer before the question is asked. The narrative itself is the answer (Nehamas, 1985, pp. 163-164). (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is correct that summarizing case studies is often difficult, especially as con- cerns case process. It is less correct as regards case outcomes. The problems in summarizing case studies, however, are due more often to the properties of the reality studied than to the case study as a research method. Often it is not desir- able to summarize and generalize case studies. Good studies should be read as narratives in their entirety. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate, however, that the revision of the five misunderstandings about case-study research described above should not be interpreted as a rejection of research that focuses on large random samples or entire popula- tions, for example, questionnaire surveys with related quantitative analysis. This type of research is also essential for the development of social science, for example, in understanding the degree to which certain phenomena are present in a given group or how they vary across cases. The advantage of large samples is breadth, whereas their problem is one of depth. For the case study, the situation is the reverse. Both approaches are necessary for a sound development of social science. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the sharp separation often seen in the literature between qualitative and quantitative methods is a spurious one (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an unfortunate artifact of power relations and time constraints in grad - uate training; it is not a logical consequence of what graduates and scholars need to know to do their studies and do them well. In my interpretation, good social science is opposed to an either/or and stands for a both/and on the question of qualitative versus quantitative methods. Good social science is problem driven and not methodology driven in the sense that it employs those methods that for a given problematic, best help answer the research questions at hand. More often than not, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will do the task best. Fortunately, there seems currently to be a general relaxation in the old and unproductive separation of qualitative and quantitative methods. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford-Connors, E., &amp;amp; Paratore, J. R. (2015). Vocabulary Instruction in Fifth Grade and Beyond: Sources of Word Learning and Productive Contexts for Development. &lt;em&gt;Review of Educational Research, 85&lt;/em&gt;(1), 50–91. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;3102&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;0034654314540943&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article provides a comprehensive and balanced review of vocabulary instruction focusing on two aspects: (1) sources of word learning, and (2) productive contexts for vocabulary learning. This review is based upon the notion that word learning is complex, multidimensional, and incremental. As for sources of word learning, it reviews (in-)effectiveness of: wide reading, direct instruction, instruction strategies emphasizing context clues, morphological analysis, awareness of polysemy, and word consciousness. The second part focusing on discussion examines different factors in discussion that facilitate vocabulary learning, the teacher&amp;rsquo;s role, and the importance of teacher orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This review is especially illuminating, recognizing &amp;ldquo;a word as a network&amp;rdquo; and discussion as an important way to contextualize vocabulary learning. In science learning, for instance, it prompt me to challenge the notion that vocabulary as byproduct of science inquiry and think vocabulary growth &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; scientific learning. Intrigued by the role of discourse in vocabulary learning, I would like to explore the distinction between &lt;em&gt;discussion of words&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;discussion of scientific concepts&lt;/em&gt; (the former one is more explored in this review), and the role of social interactions in collaborative vocabulary learning (e.g., spread of a word in a community). Technological design to support discourse would be another factor of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If young people are to succeed in a world that is dominated by ever-changing digital technologies, and accordingly new literacies, and ever-growing competition in a global economy, they will need to acquire and maintain high levels of literacy skill and analytical ability. (p. 50)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at least part of the solution resides in expanding students’ vocabulary knowledge, known to be essential to reading comprehension (Anderson &amp;amp; Freebody, 1981; Beck, McKeown, &amp;amp; Kucan, 2002; Cunningham &amp;amp; Stanovich, 1998; Davis, 1968). Students with large vocabularies demonstrate stronger reading comprehension and score higher on standardized achievement tests than their peers with smaller vocabularies (Stahl &amp;amp; Fairbanks, 1986). Moreover, vocabulary knowledge is closely linked to students’ long-term academic achievement (Cunningham &amp;amp; Stanovich, 1997; National Reading Panel, 2000), and limited vocabulary has been linked to the achievement gap for students of color, English language learners, and students with learning disabilities (Biemiller &amp;amp; Slonim, 2001; Proctor, Carlo, August, &amp;amp; Snow, 2005). (p. 51)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we searched the literature, we noted increasing evidence of positive influences of classroom discussion on students’ text comprehension and learning (e.g., Murphy, Wilkinson, Soter, Hennessey, &amp;amp; Alexander, 2009; Soter et al., 2008) (p. 51)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background for the Study (p. 51)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary’s Connection to Comprehension (p. 51)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact relationship between vocabulary and reading comprehension is not well understood (Harmon, 1998; National Reading Panel, 2000; Pearson, Hiebert, &amp;amp; Kamil, 2007). (p. 51)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nature of Word Learning (p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word knowledge exists as a rich network of information in which words are connected to mental schema, prior experience, and associations with other words, concepts, and ideas. Knowledge of a word thus extends well beyond its definition to include not only the ability to recognize a word but also to instantly access information about it and to create meaning from spoken or written texts. In fact, word knowledge is “primarily procedural rather than declarative, a matter of ‘knowing how’ rather than ‘knowing that’ &amp;hellip; knowing a word means being able to do things with it,” such that “word knowledge is applied knowledge” (Nagy &amp;amp; Scott, 2000, p. 273). (p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of what it means to know a word suggests its development as a gradual process that occurs over time and through an accumulation of experiences and exposures to words and related ideas. (p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single encounters with words, then, likely are not adequate to provide the depth of meaning, conceptual knowledge, and information about usage that permits full ownership (Graves, 2006). (p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dale (1965) represented the multidimensional and incremental nature of word knowledge as four levels or stages of knowing: (a) having no idea of a word’s meaning, (b) having heard it but not knowing its meaning, &amp;copy; recognizing it in context as related to a particular category or idea, and (d) understanding its meaning in a variety of contexts. Paribakht and Wesche (1996) added a fifth stage, suggesting that the ability to accurately use the word in speaking and writing is the ultimate marker of mastery of the word’s meaning. (p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vermeer (2001) likened word knowledge to “nodes in a network” (p. 218), linked across numerous dimensions that include both breadth and depth of knowledge, with denser networks indicating greater knowledge of and about a word. (p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disparities in children’s vocabulary, evident as early as preschool, persist into students’ later elementary and middle school years, with consequences for learning and success in school (e.g., Biemiller &amp;amp; Slonim, 2001; Hart &amp;amp; Risley, 1995; Proctor et al., 2005). (p. 53)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of Beck, McKeown, and their colleagues (Beck, Perfetti, &amp;amp; McKeown, 1982; McKeown, Beck, Omanson, &amp;amp; Perfetti, 1983; McKeown, Beck, Omanson, &amp;amp; Pople, 1985), conducted with younger (fourth-grade) students, helped establish an understanding of instructional conditions that improve vocabulary learning. Through their work, we understand that, at least for younger students, deep vocabulary learning is realized when vocabulary instruction (a) develops both definitional knowledge and understanding of a word’s broad range of semantic connections and related concepts, (b) provides many exposures to target words in multiple contexts (McKeown et al., 1983), and &amp;copy; requires that students justify and explain their reasoning as they make associations among words. (p. 53)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these well-established insights about the qualities of rich instruction that improve vocabulary learning for younger students, this type of instructional approach is not commonplace in middle or secondary school instruction. In fact, teachers often adopt relatively constricted approaches to vocabulary instruction. For instance, in a descriptive study of vocabulary instruction in 23 upper-elementary classrooms, including 308 hours of observation, Scott, Jamieson-Noel, and Asselin (2003) found that teachers spent little time engaging in discussions of word meanings with their students. Instead, the predominant methods of instruction included teachers mentioning words, providing synonyms, and assigning words to look up in the dictionary. In another study, Hedrick, Harmon, and Linerode (2004) surveyed 70 social studies teachers in intermediate and middle school grades; they found that nearly two thirds of the teachers regularly asked students to look up words and definitions as part of a unit of study (p. 53)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in a 4-month descriptive study of six classrooms with fifthand sixth-grade students, Watts (1995) observed a predominance of vocabulary instruction focused on dictionary searches and sentence creation based on definitions. (p. 54)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott and Nagy postulated that definitions offered little learning support because “the language of definitions is in some sense an extreme version of literate language—even more decontextualized, more terse, and less like oral language than most of the written language to which children have been exposed” (p. 187). (p. 54)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, there is currently limited understanding about the most productive approaches for teaching words to students as they advance into middle school and beyond, and although recent studies have begun to address this gap (e.g., Kucan, 2007; Lesaux, Kieffer, Faller, &amp;amp; Kelley, 2010), effective vocabulary instruction with older students continues to be understudied. (p. 54)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 55)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies related to direct instruction of words (p. 62)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies related to direct instruction of words plus strategies (p. 63)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies of discussion-based vocabulary instruction (p. 63)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review is organized within two major strands. The first is sources of word learning. These include (a) wide reading as a pathway to vocabulary knowledge; (b) instruction of word learning strategies, including context clues, morphological analysis, awareness of polysemy, and developing word consciousness; &amp;copy; direct instruction of individual words; and (d) direct instruction plus strategies. The second is the contexts teachers create to support these sources of word learning. This section includes research related to the focus of the discussion (e.g., conceptual vs. skills-based) and to research related to the ways in which teachers orchestrate the discussion. (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources of Word Learning (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide Reading as a Pathway to Vocabulary Knowledge (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide reading provides access to rich language, and it has been shown to have a major impact on students’ vocabulary growth. Through reading, new words are introduced within meaningful contexts and related networks of general knowledge are built. (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for vocabulary to increase through reading, students must read frequently, in significant quantities, and with texts of sufficient complexity to be exposed to new and sophisticated language (Graves, 2006). (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These collective findings suggest that many adolescents do not read in quantities sufficient to have significant impact on their vocabulary growth. (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For students who choose to read, a facet of word learning enabled through wide reading is the opportunity to infer meanings of unfamiliar words from the context provided by adjacent text. However, studies that have investigated context as a source for learning new words have found somewhat mixed results regarding its value as a dependable source of word learning. (p. 68)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, readers’ skill levels strongly influence their abilities to infer word meaning from context. (p. 68)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, despite strong evidence that wide reading contributes to vocabulary development and growth, such outcomes are likely to be realized primarily by (p. 68)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;students who engage in frequent reading of texts with complex and interesting vocabulary, who have strong English language proficiency, and who are capable readers. (p. 69)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instruction of Word Learning Strategies (p. 69)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies of instruction targeted at word learning strategies suggest four essential practices: the use of context clues, morphological analysis, understanding the polysemous nature of words, and developing metacognitive awareness of word meanings. (p. 69)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context clues. (p. 69)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined findings from these studies indicate that explicit instruction in context clues helps readers of all ability levels in defining unfamiliar words (Baumann et al., 2002; Fukkink &amp;amp; DeGlopper, 1998; Goerss et al., 1999). However, students may experience similar success when taught to use other word learning strategies (e.g., morphological analysis) or when taught to pair the use of context clues with morphological analysis (Baumann et al., 2002). (p. 70)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morphological analysis. (p. 70)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students’ ability to engage in morphological analysis becomes increasingly important as they advance in school and the morphological complexity of words in grade-level texts increases (Nippold &amp;amp; Sun, 2008). (p. 70)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagy et al. (2006) analyzed the relationships of students’ morphological awareness, phonological memory, and phonological decoding to reading comprehension, vocabulary, spelling, and decoding of complex words. Using structural equation modeling, data were analyzed for students at three grade levels: &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 183), &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 218), and &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 207). Morphological awareness made “a significant unique contribution at all grade levels” (Nagy et al., 2006, p. 140) to reading comprehension, reading vocabulary, and spelling. (p. 70)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;suggesting that skill in applying such strategies in novel situations develops with age and prior classroom experience. (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking across studies, morphological knowledge aided students in deciphering word meaning, spelling, and comprehension (Nagy et al., 2006), and skill in applying this knowledge increased as students progressed in school (Nippold &amp;amp; Sun, 2008). Morphological analysis provided a valuable tool to help students with and without disabilities unlock word meanings (Harris et al., 2011). When strategies for analysis were taught, students improved both knowledge of words and ability to infer meanings from new words (Baumann et al., 2003). As a whole, these studies also suggest that students can continue to benefit from a focus on morphology, context, and word analysis strategies as they advance in school. (p. 72)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awareness of polysemy. (p. 72)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polysemous words are understood to be “those that have more than one related sense” (Crossley, Salsbury, &amp;amp; McNamara, 2010, p. 575), containing a core meaning, as well as several related senses. (p. 72)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;providing instruction in polysemous words may improve word learning and text comprehension (Nelson &amp;amp; Stage, 2007). (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing word consciousness. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Stahl and Nagy (2006), word consciousness is a “multi-faceted construct” (p. 140) that incorporates students’ awareness of differences between oral and written language, understandings about the effect that a word’s role in a sentence may have on its meaning (syntactical awareness), knowledge of the effects of word parts on meaning (morphological awareness), and an appreciation of word choice. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;results showed that when teachers emphasized comprehension monitoring, developed students’ awareness of the importance of word meaning as a source of text comprehension, and provided explicit instruction in the use of word learning strategies, students’ reading comprehension improved. (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct Instruction of Individual Words (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to instruction of word learning strategies and approaches that build students’ word consciousness, there is widespread agreement that direct instruction of selected, key words improves vocabulary knowledge. (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such instruction may be especially important in disciplinary learning, which typically dominates instruction during later elementary, middle, and secondary school. A meta-analysis by Stahl and Fairbanks (1986) provided convincing evidence that direct instruction of key words has immediate benefit and is tied to improved reading comprehension. (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students’ word knowledge was addressed at three points during the intervention using three measures: Vocabulary Knowledge Scale–Measure of Academic Vocabulary, Vocabulary Levels Test, and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. (p. 75)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is general support for teaching individual words, there are varied approaches to determining words that merit such focused attention. Among the most familiar is Beck et al.’s (2002) identification of Tier Two words, defined as words regularly used and understood by mature language users and whose knowledge supports comprehension and communicative ability across contexts and subject areas. (p. 75)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others have suggested different criteria for selecting words for focused instruction. Biemiller (2003, p. 331) proposed teaching words that students “commonly encounter, rather than uncommon and complex words.” Nagy, Anderson, Schommer, Scott, and Stallman (1989) and Templeton (1992) recommended systematic instruction of words based on morphological characteristics and relatedness across word families. Hiebert (2005) extended this focus on word roots and families to include words that students might know through association with known words, words possessing derivatives that students frequently encounter, and words with multiple meanings. The National Reading Panel (2000, pp. 4–5) (p. 75)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;suggested choosing vocabulary words for instruction that are “derived from content learning materials” and, therefore, conceptually related to the material being taught. Finally, recent attention has been placed on selecting words from the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000) and providing instruction in those words common to disciplinary literacy and across academic texts (Nagy &amp;amp; Townsend, 2012). (p. 76)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct Instruction of Target Words Plus Strategies (p. 76)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multifaceted instruction combining explicit teaching of target words with strategies to promote students’ independence in word recognition and analysis. (p. 76)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of Sources of Word Learning (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A robust body of research that stretches over three decades sheds light on the multiple ways that words are learned. The complex nature of word knowledge demands a comprehensive approach to vocabulary instruction that acknowledges and develops the various facets of knowledge that words represent. In addition to reading widely, positive learning outcomes result from teaching students to identify and use context-based clues for determining the meanings of unfamiliar words in text (Fukkink &amp;amp; DeGlopper, 1998). In addition, morphological analysis (e.g., Baumann et al., 2002; Nippold &amp;amp; Sun, 2008) and attention to polysemy (Nelson &amp;amp; Stage, 2007) have proved useful for determining meanings of unfamiliar words. Combining strategies (e.g., morphological and contextual analysis) improves students’ vocabulary knowledge (e.g., Baumann et al., 2003). As well, strategic approaches that focus on students’ metacognition promote self-efficacy for monitoring comprehension and applying word learning strategies in new contexts (Dole et al., 1995; Lubliner &amp;amp; Smetana, 2005). (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies also affirm the value of direct instruction of target words (Stahl &amp;amp; Fairbanks, 1986; Townsend &amp;amp; Collins, 2009). Rich instruction creates variety in the instructional activities and events where target words are situated, which, in turn, offers students repeated opportunities to hear and use words, authentically. Incorporating direct word instruction with strategic instruction strengthens students’ knowledge about words as well as of words (Carlo et al., 2004; Lesaux et al., 2010). Moreover, these comprehensive instructional approaches are likely to address the multifaceted nature of word knowledge with its related networks of conceptual and semantic associations (Beck et al., 2002). (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productive Contexts for Teaching and Learning Vocabulary (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A discourse-rich approach to instruction is rooted in the work of Vygotsky (1978), who held that language serves as the principal tool for sharing knowledge and creating common understandings. He emphasized the crucial role of language in the development of students’ thinking, or inner language, to enable critical thinking and analysis and argued that thinking is facilitated and enhanced through interactions with a more knowledgeable other within a social community (Resnick, Levine, &amp;amp; Teasley, 1991). (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this theoretical orientation as a backdrop, classroom discussion offers a language-rich context in which to explore words’ meanings and uses and to tie important vocabulary to texts and content. In this way, discussion serves as a setting for the rich instruction known to support students’ word learning. (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we reasoned that an effective discussion about vocabulary, by its very nature, must be situated within a meaningful context. (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion as a Context for Vocabulary Instruction (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study set in three classrooms, Stahl and Vancil (1986) examined semantic mapping with discussion as an instructional approach to increasing sixth-grade students’ (N = 45) knowledge of lesson-related vocabulary. (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students receiving instruction under the first and second conditions (classroom discussion alone or combined with a semantic map) performed better on several posttests of vocabulary learning (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stahl and Clark (1987) investigated students’ acquisition of science vocabulary in four classrooms of fifth graders (N = 69). (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment conditions were labeled as Listening, Called-On, and Ignored. (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On each day, one group was told they would listen to, but not participate in, the class discussion, while the other two groups believed that they might be called on. During the subsequent, whole-class discussions, however, only students in the Called-On group were asked to participate. Instruction included collaboratively completing semantic maps and discussing target words, followed by silent reading of the text, and then a whole-class discussion of the text with additions to the maps. (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each group of students in the Called-On condition, scores on the immediate posttest of vocabulary learning were higher than those of comparison groups; and students in the Listening and Ignored groups scored higher than comparison students on two of the three passages. (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both participation in discussion (i.e., Called-On) and anticipation of participation (i.e., Ignored) led to significantly higher levels of word learning when compared with students in the Listening condition. (p. 79)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher-facilitated student dialogues provided the focus of a small, qualitative study by Harmon (2000) with sixthand seventh-grade students (N = 6) enrolled in developmental reading classes. Data included transcripts of audio-recorded sessions, field notes, researcher observation, and postdiscussion student self-analyses. Students worked in pairs and first read silently, then stopped periodically to discuss unfamiliar words each had identified in his/her reading. As students read and responded, the teacher used a combination of open prompts (e.g., “What gives you that idea?” Harmon, 2000, p. 333) and more specific comments to encourage students to talk about the words within the context of the text. (p. 79)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined results indicate that instructional conversations and classroom discussion provide students with opportunities to hear and use target words in appropriate and authentic contexts (Dixon-Krauss, 2002; Snow et al., 2009), and students’ interactions with each other during discussions seem to facilitate word learning and conceptual understanding (Dixon-Krauss, 2002; Harmon, 2000; Stahl &amp;amp; Vancil, 1986). Furthermore, students’ anticipation of participation in discussion seems to positively affect word learning nearly as much as actual participation (Stahl &amp;amp; Clark, 1987). Common across these studies are focal words drawn from the curriculum, such that students’ talk-based explorations of meaning also lead to deepened comprehension of texts and content. Discussion thus offers both a context and a tool for examining the relationships of words to important ideas and holds potential for improving student learning. (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Teacher’s Role in Productive Discussions (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that discussion has links to learning, and a classroom environment rich in both teacher and student talk has consistently been linked to student achievement at many grade levels and for a diverse range of learners (e.g., Knapp, 1995; Langer, 2001). Increases in amounts of student talk, with corresponding reductions in teacher talk, have also been associated with higher learning outcomes for students (Nystrand et al., 2003). (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions deemed most effective are those in which teachers orchestrate open explorations of content that engage students in critically reasoning and engaging with important ideas (Murphy et al., 2009). Overall, across these large or cross-grade level studies, greater student outcomes are associated with teachers who emphasize (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rich language, critical thinking, and conceptual understanding; connect content to students’ backgrounds and experience; develop students’ content and strategic knowledge; and emphasize instructional coherence through the links they created among instructional activities and within and across lessons and subject areas. (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers’ Orchestration of Discussion (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on an analysis of instances of teacher and student questioning, extended explanations, task-related verbal exchanges, and “reasoning words” (Soter et al., 2008, p. 373), the results showed that the most productive teacherand student-led discussions were framed by the teacher and included extended student talk, open-ended teacher questions, and high levels of teacher uptake. Longer periods of student explanation, prompted through teachers’ questions, resulted in more student reasoning and critical analysis of content. (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar findings are evident in an investigation by Nystrand et al. (2003), in which they examined the relationship among the nature of classroom discourse (e.g., types of questions, presence of uptake, student responses), student variables (e.g., characteristics of students, class size, socioeconomic status), and student learning. Based on an analysis of transcripts from audiotaped whole-class discussions in eighthand ninth-grade English and Social Studies classrooms (N = 200 classrooms), researchers found that dialogic discourse, that is, the “unprescripted exchange of ideas among students and the teacher” (Nystrand et al., 2003, p. 185), correlated with improved student learning. In addition, shifts from monologic (i.e., an emphasis on lecture and student recitation) to dialogic patterns were often preceded by teachers’ authentic questions (i.e., those with several possible answers instead of a single, correct answer). Such questions seemed to open the floor to students’ thinking rather than soliciting a recitation of material from lectures or texts. Furthermore, dialogic episodes were characterized by teachers’ uptake of students’ ideas and “high-level evaluation” (Nystrand et al., 2003, p. 146) in which teachers incorporated students’ responses, either through elaboration or a follow-up question. Finally, dialogic discourse included student questions, a characteristic less frequently found in traditional classroom discussion formats. (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found significant correlations between the nature of teachers’ questions and the level of cognitive challenge and engagement of student responses. For example, teachers’ probing questions pressed students for more explanation of their ideas and included “why” questions as well as “what does that tell us about” questions (Wolf et al., 2005, p. 46). Teachers’ productive queries further asked students to explicitly link their ideas to the text or to contributions from their peers. Teachers’ expectations for text-based evidence also increased cognitive challenge as students sought information to support their opinions. (p. 82)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these studies present a picture of effective teachers’ talk as diverse, flexible, and consisting of an extensive repertoire and variety of talk (Sharpe, 2008; Soter et al., 2008) that supports constructive, content-related interactions with students throughout lessons. Effective teachers’ talk repertoires represent a range of instructional elicitations and responses that build connections for students and help them integrate new information with what is already known (Nystrand et al., 2003; Wolf et al., 2005). In addition, throughout these investigations of content, teachers routinely embed relevant vocabulary, such that students hear words used authentically and in ways related to important content and are presented with opportunities to use relevant words in their talk (Sharpe, 2008). The talk of effective teachers also scaffolds students’ learning by stimulating exploratory talk and critical reasoning about content and engaging students with each other in instructional explorations (Sharpe, 2008; Soter et al., 2008). (p. 82)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of Productive Contexts for Teaching and Learning Vocabulary (p. 82)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language-rich interactions that occur when students and the teacher productively discuss content and grapple with ideas have proven effective as tools that strengthen students’ learning (Nystrand et al., 2003; Soter et al., 2008). (p. 83)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, discussion has proven effective as a context for vocabulary development. Discussion promotes students’ knowledge about words and conceptual understanding by creating a productive setting for exploring words and connecting vocabulary to important discipline-specific concepts (Harmon, 2000; Snow et al., 2009; Stahl &amp;amp; Clark, 1987; Stahl &amp;amp; Vancil, 1986). In addition, discussion promotes dialogic interactions through which students not only negotiate meaning but also authentically explore ideas related to important words; this new knowledge then serves as a cognitive resource for students to use in subsequent academic tasks (Dixon-Krauss, 2002; Stahl &amp;amp; Vancil, 1986). (p. 83)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classroom environments rich in high-quality teacher and student talk promote students’ learning and academic achievement. Such discussions feature authentic, teacher–student dialogic exchanges (Nystrand et al., 2003); they emphasize higher-order thinking and reasoning about content; and they include the development of students’ strategic knowledge (e.g., Langer, 2001). Productive discursive interactions can be facilitated through a range of instructional talk moves with which effective teachers provide scaffolding that engages students productively with content (Dixon-Krauss, 2002; Sharpe, 2008). A broader repertoire of teacher talk moves, including, for example, questioning, elaborating, or speculating, scaffolds students’ participation and offers students models for engaging in academic inquiry (Sharpe, 2008). Variety in teachers’ questioning techniques extends and challenges students’ thinking while encouraging the exploratory talk that supports critical analysis of content (e.g., Nystrand et al., 2003). Moreover, through uptake and revoicing, teachers extend students’ ideas and productively sustain explorations of content (e.g., Wolf et al., 2005). (p. 83)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 83)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the simplistic view of word learning through dictionary definitions that often predominates in classroom instruction (Blachowicz, Fisher, Ogle, &amp;amp; Watts-Taffe, 2006; Hedrick et al., 2004) is largely ineffective for increasing students’ understanding of words. Rather, deep word knowledge emerges over time through productive interactions with authentic texts, tasks, and talk (Beck et al., 2002; Beck, McKeown, &amp;amp; Kucan, 2008; Blachowicz &amp;amp; Fisher, 2000; Graves, 2006; Scott, 2005; Stahl &amp;amp; Nagy, 2006). (p. 83)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is it that highly expert teachers do to prepare students to acquire vocabulary knowledge through reading? Our review led us to categorize findings within the context of two major teaching actions. The first teaching action relates to the sources of word learning teachers lead their students to understand and access. In addition to wide reading, these sources include ability to use context clues, to understand and use the morphological structure of words, to understand and use the polysemous nature of words, and to become conscious of and interested in words all around them. (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second action teachers take relates to the ways they frame classroom discussions to prompt productive explorations and provide the “rich oral language” necessary to build networks of semantic and associative information about words (McKeown et al., 1983; McKeown et al., 1985; Stahl &amp;amp; Vancil, 1987). Exploring words and their meanings through discussions of classroom texts and content anchors students’ developing vocabulary in meaningful contexts with authentic applications and opportunities to experience words in ways that support learning. These explorations also contribute to the development of word consciousness and raise students’ appreciation for and awareness of the communicative power of language (Graves, 2006). It is predominantly through this rich use of language in the classroom that vocabulary comes to life as students interact productively with words and concepts. (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, productive explorations of words through classroom discussion do not occur by happenstance. Rather, they emerge through a teacher’s deep knowledge and careful orchestration and use of a repertoire of talk moves that prompt their students to think about, talk about, and use vocabulary to develop deeper understanding of important concepts and ideas within the texts they read and the world around them. (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;research suggests that discussions as contexts for word learning are relatively uncommon (Scott et al., 2003). Moreover, many teachers view themselves as largely inconsequential in the quality of discussions; instead, they attribute productive discourse as resulting more from luck or timing than from a teacher’s knowledge and discursive skill (Adler et al., &lt;sup&gt;2003&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2004&lt;/sub&gt;). It seems that, at this point, many teachers lack a deep understanding of the teacher’ pivotal role in orchestrating productive classroom talk. (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implications for Future Research (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Common Core State Standards (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, we must focus attention on identifying the types of preservice and in-service education that will help teachers understand the complexity of word knowledge and, in turn, to acquire and learn to flexibly use the repertoire of talk moves that engender productive discussions about words and the important conceptual knowledge that words represent.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthesizing the literature around the general topics of vocabu- lary instruction, classroom discourse, and teacher talk, this review provides a comprehensive and critical examination of instruction that supports vocab- ulary learning in older students with a particular focus on practices that promote productive discussions of content. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, according to the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP, 2013) report, the percentage of eighth-grade students achieving reading proficiency has increased slightly (from 30% in 2011 to 32% in 2013), the overall result is the same: Only one third of those tested comprehend text proficiently. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a large gap remains between minority and nonminority students (NAEP, 2013). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alvermann (2001, p. 4) argued that “basic level literacy is insufficient in today’s world (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If young people are to succeed in a world that is dominated by ever-changing digital tech- nologies, and accordingly new literacies, and ever-growing competition in a global economy, they will need to acquire and maintain high levels of literacy skill and analytical ability. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students with large vocabularies demonstrate stronger reading comprehension and score higher on standardized achievement tests than their peers with smaller vocabularies (Stahl &amp;amp; Fairbanks, 1986). Moreover, vocabulary knowledge is closely linked to students’ long-term aca- demic achievement (Cunningham &amp;amp; Stanovich, 1997; National Reading Panel, 2000), and limited vocabulary has been linked to the achievement gap for students of color, English language learners, and students with learning disabilities (Biemiller &amp;amp; Slonim, 2001; Proctor, Carlo, August, &amp;amp; Snow, 2005). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;increasing evi- dence of positive influences of classroom discussion on students’ text comprehen- sion and learning (e.g., Murphy, Wilkinson, Soter, Hennessey, &amp;amp; Alexander, 2009; Soter et al., 2008), and we wondered to what extent classroom discussion also exerted an influence on vocabulary learning (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set our sights on students in Grades 5 through 12 for two reasons. First, researchers have identified that literacy learning of young ado- lescents as an area in need of greater attention (e.g., Biancarosa &amp;amp; Snow, 2004). Second, as students advance through the grades, the texts they are expected to read increase in both concept density and linguistic complexity. As a result, both knowing words and also knowing how to derive meanings of unfamiliar words has more importance in achieving text understanding, thus helping realize a level of reading proficiency that will prepare students for success in and out of school. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We next examine the nature of word learning, with a focus on what it means to know a word. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background for the Study (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary’s Connection to Comprehension (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact relationship between vocabulary and reading comprehension is not well understood (Harmon, 1998; National Reading Panel, 2000; Pearson, Hiebert, &amp;amp; Kamil, 2007). Although vocabulary is recognized as a predictor of reading comprehension, it also develops as a result of reading (RAND Reading Study Group, 2002). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second proposes that gen- eral knowledge of the world supports both vocabulary and text comprehension, with all three connected through mental schema (e.g., Anderson &amp;amp; Freebody, 1981). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth suggests that the relationship of vocabulary to reading compre- hension is likely bidirectional and reciprocal, with comprehension and vocabulary influencing each other recursively, and with both connected to reading volume (Nagy, 2005). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In undertaking this review, we considered these hypotheses not as competing theories but as evidence of an intricate network of skills, knowledge, and cogni- tive processes that are multidirectional, reciprocal, and that, at different points in time and in different contexts, exert more or less influence on each other. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nature of Word Learning (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word knowledge exists as a rich network of information in which words are connected to mental schema, prior experience, and associations with other words, concepts, and ideas. Knowledge of a word thus extends well beyond its definition to include not only the ability to recognize a word but also to instantly access information about it and to create meaning from spoken or written texts. In fact, word knowledge is “primarily procedural rather than declarative, a matter of ‘knowing how’ rather than ‘knowing that’ &amp;hellip; knowing a word means being able to do things with it,” such that “word knowledge is applied knowledge” (Nagy &amp;amp; Scott, 2000, p. 273). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;its development as a gradual process that occurs over time and through an accumulation of experi- ences and exposures to words and related ideas (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dale (1965) represented the multidimensional and incremental nature of word knowledge as four levels or stages of knowing: (a) having no idea of a word’s meaning, (b) having heard it but not knowing its meaning, &amp;copy; recognizing it in context as related to a particular category or idea, and (d) understanding its mean- ing in a variety of contexts. Paribakht and Wesche (1996) added a fifth stage, suggesting that the ability to accurately use the word in speaking and writing is the ultimate marker of mastery of the word’s meaning. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagy and Scott (2000) further explained dimensions of word knowledge as incrementality, that is, word learning is a process that occurs in small steps; poly- semy, that is, the same word can have different meanings or similar, but nuanced, meanings; multidimensionality, that is, word knowledge includes various forms, including spoken, written, grammatical function, location with other words, rela- tionships to other words, frequency of use, and conceptual meaning (Nation, 1990); interrelatedness, that is, connectedness to other words, categories, con- cepts, and ideas; and heterogeneity, that is, those aspects of word knowledge that influence what one knows about the word. Vermeer (2001) likened word knowl- edge to “nodes in a network” (p. 218), linked across numerous dimensions that include both breadth and depth of knowledge, with denser networks indicating greater knowledge of and about a word. Word knowledge is thus far more than simple labels or definitions but rather a deep network that holds crucial (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;connections to language development and growth in general knowledge. When viewed together, these multiple dimensions illumine the complexity of word knowledge and suggest not only its influence on reading comprehension but also its fundamental role in general knowledge acquisition. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;given the significant differences in vocabulary knowledge that children bring to the classroom. Disparities in children’s vocabulary, evident as early as preschool, persist into students’ later elementary and middle school years, with consequences for learning and success in school (e.g., Biemiller &amp;amp; Slonim, 2001; Hart &amp;amp; Risley, 1995; Proctor et al., 2005). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of Beck, McKeown, and their colleagues (Beck, Perfetti, &amp;amp; McKeown, 1982; McKeown, Beck, Omanson, &amp;amp; Perfetti, 1983; McKeown, Beck, Omanson, &amp;amp; Pople, 1985), conducted with younger (fourth-grade) students, helped establish an understanding of instructional conditions that improve vocabulary learning. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;deep vocab- ulary learning is realized when vocabulary instruction (a) develops both defini- tional knowledge and understanding of a word’s broad range of semantic connections and related concepts, (b) provides many exposures to target words in multiple contexts (McKeown et al., 1983), and &amp;copy; requires that students justify and explain their reasoning as they make associations among words. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this type of instructional approach is not commonplace in middle or secondary school instruction. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common practices identified by these studies do little to increase students’ vocabulary, and an instructional focus on definitional information may actually lead to misinterpretations about word meaning. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott and Nagy postulated that definitions offered little learning support because “the language of definitions is in some sense an extreme version of literate language—even more decontextualized, more terse, and less like oral language than most of the written language to which children have been exposed” (p. 187). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Reading Panel (2000) acknowledged that although we have a fairly well-devel- oped understanding of the various facets of vocabulary knowledge, little is known about the instructional contexts that support its growth, especially after fifth grade. As a result, there is currently limited understanding about the most produc- tive approaches for teaching words to students as they advance into middle school and beyond, and although recent studies have begun to address this gap (e.g., Kucan, 2007; Lesaux, Kieffer, Faller, &amp;amp; Kelley, 2010), effective vocabulary instruction with older students continues to be understudied. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our investigation, then, centered on the question, What are the instructional practices and classroom con- texts that improve the vocabulary knowledge of young adolescent and adolescent students? (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we searched Academic OneFile, Education Full Text, and ERIC databases for investigations (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the key words vocabulary instruction and adoles- cent, our search of Academic OneFile yielded 33 results, Education Full Text yielded 288, and ERIC generated 23 results. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms classroom discourse and vocabulary yielded a total of 1,141 studies from these databases, but when we added adolescent or middle school as additional search terms, the results fell closer to 300. A search of the three databases using the key words and phrases teacher talk, vocabulary, and adolescent yielded 146 results. We next searched the same three databases on the terms vocabulary instruction and classroom discourse. This combination of terms yielded 63 studies. We also searched with a combination of vocabulary instruction and teacher talk, which resulted in 35 studies. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we accepted only studies from peer-reviewed journals. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we included both quantitative and qualitative research designs (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also elimi- nated studies with a focus on teaching English as a foreign language. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to contextualize the findings, we included meta-analyses and noted them as such in our review. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these restrictions applied, 33 studies remained. Among the included stud- ies, 28 focused on vocabulary development and/or vocabulary instruction; of these, 21 were quantitative or mixed-methods designs, 4 were qualitative, and 3 were meta-analyses (Table 1). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This review is qualitative rather than quantitative. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review is organized within two major strands. The first is sources of word learning. These include (a) wide reading as a pathway to vocabulary knowledge; (b) instruction of word learning strategies, including context clues, morphological analysis, awareness of polysemy, and developing word consciousness; &amp;copy; direct instruction of individual words; and (d) direct instruction plus strategies. The sec- ond is the contexts teachers create to support these sources of word learning. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources of Word Learning (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide Reading as a Pathway to Vocabulary Knowledge (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In studies with students in Grades 4, 5, and 6 ( N = 134), Cunningham and Stanovich (1991) demonstrated that the quantity of students’ reading signifi- cantly contributed to growth in both vocabulary and overall knowledge. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for vocabulary to increase through reading, students must read fre- quently, in significant quantities, and with texts of sufficient complexity to be exposed to new and sophisticated language (Graves, 2006). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These col- lective findings suggest that many adolescents do not read in quantities sufficient to have significant impact on their vocabulary growth. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, readers’ skill levels strongly influence their abilities to infer word meaning from context. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion that characteristics of the focal and adjacent words, and of the readers, themselves, may render the text-based context an inconsistent source for acquiring vocabulary is further supported by evidence from Swanborn and deGlopper’s (1999) meta-analysis of 20 incidental word learning studies. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results indicated the probability of learning a particular word’s meaning based on a single encounter with it in context to be around 15%, with low-ability and younger readers demonstrating far greater difficulty inferring meaning than high- ability and older readers. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, despite strong evidence that wide reading contributes to vocabulary development and growth, such outcomes are likely to be realized primarily by (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;students who engage in frequent reading of texts with complex and interesting vocabulary, who have strong English language proficiency, and who are capable readers. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent sections, we explore studies of instruction and classroom practices that promote vocabulary growth. We have organized these studies in two groups: those that examine instruction of word learning strategies and those that examine direct instruction of target words. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instruction of Word Learning Strategies (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies of instruction targeted at word learning strategies suggest four essential practices: the use of context clues, morphological analysis, understanding the polysemous nature of words, and developing metacognitive awareness of word meanings. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fukkink and DeGlopper (1998) conducted a meta-analysis of 12 studies focused on improving students’ skill in deriving word meaning from context while reading. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaches to instruction varied among five types: (a) teaching students to identify context clues, (b) using cloze tasks to increase students’ awareness of related language found in the text and surrounding novel words, c) teaching strategies to infer word meaning, (d) focusing on definitional approaches to develop a general schema of a word’s meaning, (e) and practice-only conditions in which students practiced exercises but without other instruction. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with a mean effect size of .43 for these treatment groups. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined findings from these studies indicate that explicit instruction in con- text clues helps readers of all ability levels in defining unfamiliar words (Baumann et al., 2002; Fukkink &amp;amp; DeGlopper, 1998; Goerss et al., 1999). However, students may experience similar success when taught to use other word learning strategies (e.g., morphological analysis) or when taught to pair the use of context clues with morphological analysis (Baumann et al., 2002). (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morphological analysis. Students’ ability to engage in morphological analysis becomes increasingly important as they advance in school and the morphologi- cal complexity of words in grade-level texts increases (Nippold &amp;amp; Sun, 2008). (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morphological awareness made “a signifi- cant unique contribution at all grade levels” (Nagy et al., 2006, p. 140) to reading comprehension, reading vocabulary, and spelling. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking across studies, morphological knowledge aided students in decipher- ing word meaning, spelling, and comprehension (Nagy et al., 2006), and skill in applying this knowledge increased as students progressed in school (Nippold &amp;amp; Sun, 2008). Morphological analysis provided a valuable tool to help students with and without disabilities unlock word meanings (Harris et al., 2011). When strate- gies for analysis were taught, students improved both knowledge of words and ability to infer meanings from new words (Baumann et al., 2003). As a whole, these studies also suggest that students can continue to benefit from a focus on morphology, context, and word analysis strategies as they advance in school. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awareness of polysemy. Polysemous words are understood to be “those that have more than one related sense” (Crossley, Salsbury, &amp;amp; McNamara, 2010, p. 575), containing a core meaning, as well as several related senses. Awareness of words’ polysemous nature is a metalinguistic skill that improves students’ abil- ity to derive meaning in academic work. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combination, studies reviewed thus far suggest three important understand- ings about words that contribute to discerning word meanings. Direct instruction in context clues is effective for raising students’ awareness of the meaning of unfamiliar words, both as an independent strategy and in combination with other strategies. In addition, morphological awareness makes an important contribution to students’ vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension; ability to use morphological analysis seems to develop as students progress in school (Ram et al., 2013; Wysocki &amp;amp; Jenkins, 1987) and, therefore, may be of particular benefit to students beginning in the late elementary and middle grades where texts typi- cally contain longer and more complex words and convey more abstract ideas (e.g., Nagy et al., 2006; Nippold &amp;amp; Sun, 2008). Furthermore, providing instruc- tion in polysemous words may improve word learning and text comprehension (Nelson &amp;amp; Stage, 2007). (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing word consciousness. According to Stahl and Nagy (2006), word consciousness is a “multi-faceted construct” (p. 140) that incorporates students’ awareness of differences between oral and written language, understandings about the effect that a word’s role in a sentence may have on its meaning (syntactical awareness), knowledge of the effects of word parts on meaning (morphological awareness), and an appreciation of word choice. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, they were subject to the naturalistic classroom con- ditions and potentially variable instruction of the teachers who implemented the interventions (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct Instruction of Individual Words (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is widespread agreement that direct instruc- tion of selected, key words improves vocabulary knowledge. Such instruction may be especially important in disciplinary learning (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stahl and Fairbanks (1986) provided convincing evidence that direct instruction of key words has immediate benefit and is tied to improved reading comprehension. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is general support for teaching individual words, there are var- ied approaches to determining words that merit such focused attention. Among the most familiar is Beck et al.’s (2002) identification of Tier Two words, defined as words regularly used and understood by mature language users and whose knowledge supports comprehension and communicative ability across contexts and subject areas. In this approach, focal words are selected according to the cur- ricular and text content and needs of the students in the classroom. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others have suggested different criteria for selecting words for focused instruc- tion. Biemiller (2003, p. 331) proposed teaching words that students “commonly encounter, rather than uncommon and complex words.” (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiebert (2005) extended this focus on word roots and families to include words that students might know through association with known words, words possessing derivatives that students frequently encounter, and words with multiple meanings. The National Reading Panel (2000, pp. 4–5) (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;suggested choosing vocabulary words for instruction that are “derived from con- tent learning materials” and, therefore, conceptually related to the material being taught. Finally, recent attention has been placed on selecting words from the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000) and providing instruction in those words common to disciplinary literacy and across academic texts (Nagy &amp;amp; Townsend, 2012). (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct Instruction of Target Words Plus Strategies (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several recent studies have combined direct teaching of focal words with strat- egy instruction to increase students’ knowledge of target words and strengthen their abilities to independently determine the meaning of unfamiliar words. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multifaceted instruc- tion combining explicit teaching of target words with strategies to promote stu- dents’ independence in word recognition and analysis. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of Sources of Word Learning (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A robust body of research that stretches over three decades sheds light on the multiple ways that words are learned. The complex nature of word knowledge demands a comprehensive approach to vocabulary instruction that acknowledges and develops the various facets of knowledge that words represent. In addition to reading widely, positive learning outcomes result from teaching students to iden- tify and use context-based clues for determining the meanings of unfamiliar words in text (Fukkink &amp;amp; DeGlopper, 1998). In addition, morphological analysis (e.g., Baumann et al., 2002; Nippold &amp;amp; Sun, 2008) and attention to polysemy (Nelson &amp;amp; Stage, 2007) have proved useful for determining meanings of unfamiliar words. Combining strategies (e.g., morphological and contextual analysis) improves stu- dents’ vocabulary knowledge (e.g., Baumann et al., 2003). As well, strategic approaches that focus on students’ metacognition promote self-efficacy for moni- toring comprehension and applying word learning strategies in new contexts (Dole et al., 1995; Lubliner &amp;amp; Smetana, 2005). (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies also affirm the value of direct instruction of target words (Stahl &amp;amp; Fairbanks, 1986; Townsend &amp;amp; Collins, 2009). Rich instruction creates variety in the instructional activities and events where target words are situated, which, in turn, offers students repeated opportunities to hear and use words, authentically. Incorporating direct word instruction with strategic instruction strengthens stu- dents’ knowledge about words as well as of words (Carlo et al., 2004; Lesaux et al., 2010). Moreover, these comprehensive instructional approaches are likely to address the multifaceted nature of word knowledge with its related networks of conceptual and semantic associations (Beck et al., 2002). (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productive Contexts for Teaching and Learning Vocabulary (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related line of research in vocabulary instruction has focused on discussion as a productive context for vocabulary teaching and learning. A discourse-rich approach to instruction is rooted in the work of Vygotsky (1978), who held that language serves as the principal tool for sharing knowledge and creating common understandings. He emphasized the crucial role of language in the development of students’ thinking, or inner language, to enable critical thinking and analysis and argued that thinking is facilitated and enhanced through interactions with a more knowledgeable other within a social community (Resnick, Levine, &amp;amp; Teasley, 1991). (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;classroom discussion offers a language-rich context in which to explore words’ meanings and uses and to tie important vocabulary to texts and content. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given what we have learned about the development of deep knowledge of word meanings and, in particular, the need for students to explore word meanings within a broad semantic context of the word, we reasoned that an effective discus- sion about vocabulary, by its very nature, must be situated within a meaningful context. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion as a Context for Vocabulary Instruction (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n a study set in three class- rooms, Stahl and Vancil (1986) examined semantic mapping with discussion as an instructional approach to increasing sixth-grade students’ (N = 45) knowledge of lesson-related vocabulary. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students receiving instruction under the first and second conditions (classroom discussion alone or combined with a semantic map) per- formed better on several posttests of vocabulary learning, with no significant dif- ferences between the two groups, than did students who worked with semantic maps alone. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stahl and Clark (1987) investigated students’ acquisition of science vocabulary in four classrooms of fifth graders (N = 69). (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;students also demonstrated significantly higher concept learning than comparison students. Students were also compared across treatment groups, with significant differences in word learning found among them, as measured by the sentence anomaly test: both participation in discussion (i.e., Called-On) and anticipation of participation (i.e., Ignored) led to significantly higher levels of word learning when compared with students in the Listening condition. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snow et al. (2009) studied effects of a 24-week program for middle school stu- dents focused on developing students’ academic vocabulary through discussions of high-interest topics. Five new focal words, taken from the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000), were introduced each week (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;target word learning of treatment group students sur - passed that of control group students with effect sizes ranging from .33 to .56. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dixon-Krauss (2002) undertook a “mediation model design” (p. 310) for vocabulary instruction in two ninth-grade English classes (N = 43). (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students’ knowledge of target words was stronger after the second lesson series in which words were emphasized in context. The number of focal words students used in their writing decreased but their appropriate uses of vocabulary words increased. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher-facilitated student dialogues provided the focus of a small, qualitative study by Harmon (2000) with sixth- and seventh-grade students (N = 6) enrolled in developmental reading classes. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout these teacher-facilitated discussions, students used a variety of strategies to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or to connect the word to (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the text. Working together, some students consulted the immediate textual context or made connections to personal experiences or the more general story line to grapple with possible word meanings. Other students relied more heavily on teacher prompts and guidance to try to explain the word’s meaning and to clarify its relationship to the story. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harmon concluded that discussions supported students’ sharing of these various strategies and encouraged metacognitive approaches to word meaning, but with varying levels of skill. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion thus offers both a context and a tool for examining the relationships of words to important ideas and holds potential for improving student learning. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Teacher’s Role in Productive Discussions (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence of their effectiveness, discussions as contexts for word learn- ing are relatively uncommon in the classroom (Scott et al., 2003). (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is limited information to guide teachers in how to engage students or facilitate these conversations about vocabulary in productive ways. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a classroom environment rich in both teacher and student talk has consistently been linked to student achievement at many grade levels and for a diverse range of learners (e.g., Knapp, 1995; Langer, 2001). (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;others have noted that quality of the classroom talk trumps quantity; thus, it is not so much how much students talk as what they talk about that seems to drive the effectiveness of these discursive environments. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions deemed most effective are those in which teachers orchestrate open explorations of content that engage students in critically reasoning and engaging with impor- tant ideas (Murphy et al., 2009). (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite these important understandings, there is substantial variability in the effectiveness with which teachers facilitate discussions (Adler, Rougle, Kaiser, &amp;amp; Caughlan, &lt;sup&gt;2003&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2004&lt;/sub&gt;; Soter et al., 2008). (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers’ Orchestration of Discussion (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer periods of student explanation, prompted through teachers’ ques- tions, resulted in more student reasoning and critical analysis of content. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nystrand et al. (2003), in which they examined the relationship among the nature of classroom discourse (e.g., types of questions, presence of uptake, student responses), student variables (e.g., characteristics of students, class size, socioeconomic status), and student learning. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;researchers found that dialogic discourse, that is, the “unprescripted exchange of ideas among students and the teacher” (Nystrand et al., 2003, p. 185), correlated with improved student learning. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, dialogic episodes were characterized by teachers’ uptake of students’ ideas and “high-level evaluation” (Nystrand et al., 2003, p. 146) in which teachers incorporated students’ responses, either through elaboration or a follow-up question. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolf et al. (2005) examined the relationship between teacher talk and the rigor of classroom discussions. They rated rigor on the basis of instruction and discussion that required students to grapple with ideas (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found signifi- cant correlations between the nature of teachers’ questions and the level of cogni- tive challenge and engagement of student responses. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a case study, Sharpe (2008) described the kinds of talk used by an experi- enced middle school teacher to scaffold students’ participation in historical inquiry (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transcript analysis indicated that the teacher used questioning and “low control” moves (Wood, 1992), like speculating and suggesting, that encouraged students to generate mul- tiple ideas about the topic and increased “prospectiveness” (i.e., exploratory talk that promoted hypotheses about events and people of that time period; Sharpe, 2008, p. 138). (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these studies present a picture of effective teachers’ talk as diverse, flexible, and consisting of an extensive repertoire and variety of talk (Sharpe, 2008; Soter et al., 2008) that supports constructive, content-related inter- actions with students throughout lessons. Effective teachers’ talk repertoires rep- resent a range of instructional elicitations and responses that build connections for students and help them integrate new information with what is already known (Nystrand et al., 2003; Wolf et al., 2005). (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of Productive Contexts for Teaching and Learning Vocabulary (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language-rich interactions that occur when students and the teacher productively discuss content and grapple with ideas have proven effective as tools that strengthen students’ learning (Nystrand et al., 2003; Soter et al., 2008). (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, discussion has proven effective as a context for vocabulary devel- opment. Discussion promotes students’ knowledge about words and conceptual understanding by creating a productive setting for exploring words and connect- ing vocabulary to important discipline-specific concepts (Harmon, 2000; Snow et al., 2009; Stahl &amp;amp; Clark, 1987; Stahl &amp;amp; Vancil, 1986). In addition, discussion promotes dialogic interactions through which students not only negotiate mean- ing but also authentically explore ideas related to important words; this new knowledge then serves as a cognitive resource for students to use in subsequent academic tasks (Dixon-Krauss, 2002; Stahl &amp;amp; Vancil, 1986). (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such discussions feature authentic, teacher–student dialogic exchanges (Nystrand et al., 2003); they emphasize higher-order thinking and reasoning about content; and they include the develop- ment of students’ strategic knowledge (e.g., Langer, 2001). (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a range of instructional talk moves with which effective teachers provide scaffolding that engages students productively with content (Dixon-Krauss, 2002; Sharpe, 2008). A broader repertoire of teacher talk moves, including, for example, questioning, elaborating, or speculating, scaf- folds students’ participation and offers students models for engaging in academic inquiry (Sharpe, 2008). (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;t is clear that vocabulary is a complex construct with connections to many aspects of language development and general knowledge growth. As such, the simplistic view of word learning through dictionary definitions that often predominates in classroom instruction (Blachowicz, Fisher, Ogle, &amp;amp; Watts-Taffe, 2006; Hedrick et al., 2004) is largely ineffective for increasing students’ understanding of words. Rather, deep word knowledge emerges over time through productive interactions with authentic texts, tasks, and talk (Beck et al., 2002; Beck, McKeown, &amp;amp; Kucan, 2008; Blachowicz &amp;amp; Fisher, 2000; Graves, 2006; Scott, 2005; Stahl &amp;amp; Nagy, 2006). (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second action teachers take relates to the ways they frame classroom dis- cussions to prompt productive explorations and provide the “rich oral language” necessary to build networks of semantic and associative information about words (McKeown et al., 1983; McKeown et al., 1985; Stahl &amp;amp; Vancil, 1987). Exploring words and their meanings through discussions of classroom texts and content anchors students’ developing vocabulary in meaningful contexts with authentic applications and opportunities to experience words in ways that support learning. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to address the multidimensionality of what it means to know a word (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;research suggests that discus- sions as contexts for word learning are relatively uncommon (Scott et al., 2003). (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead, they attribute productive discourse as resulting more from luck or timing than from a teacher’s knowledge and discursive skill (Adler et al., &lt;sup&gt;2003&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2004&lt;/sub&gt;). It seems that, at this point, many teachers lack a deep under- standing of the teacher’ pivotal role in orchestrating productive classroom talk. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various measures  were  collected  at  pre  and  posttests  including  epistemological  beliefs,  conceptual-change  questions  and  online  discourse  and  reflection.  Results  indicated  that  experimentalstudents made more gains than comparison students on both conceptual and epistemologicalmeasures.  Epistemological  beliefs  and  knowledge-building  reflection  were  correlated  withscience learning; regression analyses indicated that knowledge-building reflection and inquirycontributed to conceptual change over and above prior knowledge and epistemological beliefs. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considerable  debates  and  interests  have  now  been  given  to  examining  cognitive  and  socio-cultural perspectives of learning (Anderson, Reder &amp;amp; Simon, 1997) and conceptual change (Mason, 2007). Traditionally, conceptual  change  has  been  viewed  from  the  cognitive  perspective  emphasizing  cognitive  conflict  (Posner,Strike,  Hewson  &amp;amp;  Gertzog,  1982),  ontological  shifts  (Chi,  Slotta  &amp;amp;  de  Leeuw,  1994)  and  epistemologicalcommitment in knowledge restructuring (Vosniadou &amp;amp; Brewer, 1987). Currently, conceptual change has been examined from the socio-cultural perspective emphasizing enculturation of practice and discursive interactions and social construction of knowledge in the science classroom (Scott, Asoko &amp;amp; Leach, 2007). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent  research  on  intentional  conceptual  change  emphasizes  the  role  of  learner’s  intentions, epistemological beliefs, motivation, and agency in knowledge restructuring (Sinatra &amp;amp; Pintrich, 2003). It also points to the need to design learning environments that encourage learners to integrate goal-directed strategies and to develop metaconceptual awareness for intentional conceptual change. A major related strand that has attracted much attention examines epistemological beliefs or beliefs about the nature of knowledge, knowing and learning (Hofer &amp;amp; Pintrinch, 2003). Increased research evidence has shown how these beliefs can facilitate or constrain student understanding, reasoning, thinking, and science learning. For example, research indicated that a belief about knowledge as certain and simple was negatively correlated with conceptual change learning from refutational text. Students’ immature beliefs about learning and knowledge are related to difficulties in their  conceptual  understanding  (Qian  and  Alvermann,  2000).  Students  who  hold  more  sophisticated epistemological beliefs are more likely to consider conflictual and controversial information; epistemological beliefs  have  been  shown  as  a  major  predictor  of  argumentation  (Mason  &amp;amp;  Scirica,  2006).  For  example, Stathopoulou and Vosniadou (2007) examined the relationships between physics-related epistemological beliefs and physics conceptual understanding amongst 10th grade students. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas it is now recognized that cognitive and situated perspectives are to be integrated (Mason, 2007; Vosniadou, 2007), less attention has been given to how learning environment can be designed to bridge these two perspectives, and how to foster epistemological change and metaconceptual awareness mediated by collective discursive practice. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on knowledge building has shown how the approach can help restructure scientific discourse,foster  deep  understanding,  and  enhance  inquiry-based  scientific  understanding  (e.g.,  Caswell  and  Bielaczyc,2001; Lee, Chan &amp;amp; van Aalst, 2006; van Aalst &amp;amp; Chan, 2007). Hakkarainen (2004) analysed young students’written productions in Physics posted to CSILE’s database, and indicated that they engaged in epistemic agencyand  pursed  explanation-driven  inquiry  and  some  of  them  moved  towards  theoretical  scientific  explanation.Zhang et al (2007) examined socio-cognitive dynamics examining epistemic agency of students in advancingtheir science knowledge for 5th and 6th grade students. Vosniadou and Kollias (2003) employed KnowledgeForum  to  foster  the  development  of  discourse  and  students’  ideas,  beliefs,  and  metaconceptual  awareness. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the role of knowledge building in fostering conceptual andepistemological  changes  in  the  context  of  Grade  10  chemistry  students  collaborating  onKnowledge  Forum  in  a  Hong  Kong  classroom. The  following  research  questions  were  addressed:  (1)  What  were  the  effects  of  knowledge building on science learning and conceptual change? (2) What was the nature of epistemological beliefs, and what were the effects of knowledge building on epistemological change? And (3) What characterized students’ engagement on Knowledge Forum, and what were the relationships among epistemological beliefs, knowledge-building process and conceptual change? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;method-p-2&#34;&gt;Method (p. 2)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study employed a quasi-experimental pre-posttest research design. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epistemological  Beliefs  Questionnaire.  A  questionnaire  of  28  items  was  designed  based  on  earlierwork  for  elementary  school  science  students  (Conley  et  al.,  2004). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptual-Change Questions.  A  paper  and  pencil  test  was  administered  to  both  classes  to  identifyconceptual  difficulties,  and  to  assess  students’  knowledge  structures  and  understanding  of  the  concepts  ofelectrochemistry. The instrument consisted of open-ended items, multiple-choice and true/false items followedby  giving  reasons  for  the  choices. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructional design followed earlier studies using knowledge building in Hong Kong classroom(Lee et al., 2006). A four-phase instructional design was used: (a) Developing a collaborative culture wherestudents  were  asked  to  put  ideas  to  the  public;  (b)  Knowledge-building  inquiry:  Knowledge  Forum  wasintroduced  and  students  engaged  in  posing  problems,  making  conjectures  and  hypotheses,  co-constructingexplanations, comparing different theories and explanations; &amp;copy; Deepening and Rise-Above: students deepenedtheir  understanding  using  rise-above  notes  and  synthesized  their  understanding;  and  (d)  alignment  ofassessment:  students  wrote  reflections  and  e-portfolios  identifying  and  capturing  their  own  and  communityprogress in knowledge building in their discourse. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results-p-3&#34;&gt;RESULTS (p. 3)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;differences-of-science-learning-and-conceptual-change-for-groups-p-3&#34;&gt;Differences of Science Learning and Conceptual Change for Groups (p. 3)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both  classes  showed  decreases  and  the Knowledge Forum students showed more decreases in several misconceptions. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge building students outperformed the comparison students on conceptual change scores in electrochemistry. Analyses of students’ pretest and posttest examination questions indicated no differences. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An independent sample t-test on pretest scores indicated no differences at pretest. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;differences-of-epistemological-change-for-groups-p-4&#34;&gt;Differences of Epistemological Change for Groups (p. 4)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the  experimental  students  had  significantly  more  changes  than comparison  students  (t  (77)  =  4.75,  p&amp;lt;.01)  on  overall  scores.  Further  analyses  indicated  that  significant differences  were  found  on  certainty-source  (t  (77)  =  4.47,  p&amp;lt;.01),  and  development  (t  (77)  =  5.48,  p&amp;lt;.01)indicating that Knowledge Building students made more changes from viewing knowledge as simplistic towards complex notions; and from seeing knowledge as static towards knowledge as extendable. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;relationships-among-epistemological-beliefs-knowledge-building-and-conceptualchange-p-5&#34;&gt;Relationships among Epistemological Beliefs, Knowledge Building and ConceptualChange (p. 5)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlations indicated that epistemological beliefs were significantly correlated with several pre and postscience learning measures (rs = .27 to .34, p&amp;lt;.05) suggesting that EB is linked to science learning. Significant correlation were also observed between knowledge building reflection(metaconceptual awareness) with pretest epistemological beliefs (r = .33, p&amp;lt;.05) and with post EB development(rs = .36, p&amp;lt;.05). These findings suggest that students with more sophisticated beliefs are more likely to engagein  deeper  reflection.  Further,  there  were  significant  correlations  between  knowledge  building  reflection  andinquiry with conceptual change learning (rs =. 39-.46, p&amp;lt;.05). These finding indicate some positive correlationsamong epistemological beliefs, metaconceptual awareness (reflection) and conceptual change. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also examined epistemological belief as dependent variables to examine what would contribute to its change. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that pretest epistemological beliefs was a significant predictor(R = .51) explaining 26% of variance. We found that the quantitative knowledge-forum collaboration indexcontributed to posttest EB over and above pretest beliefs. Students who participated on Knowledge Forum with high collaboration activities (notes read, notes linked, and keywords) appeared to shift more tosophisticated beliefs over and above pretest beliefs. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results indicated that prior conceptual-based scores was a significant predictor (R =.48)that explains 23% of variance of posttest conceptual scores. When knowledge-building reflection was added tothe analyses, multiple R increased to .58 that explains another 10% of variance with significant change. Whenepistemological beliefs were added, there were no increased variances explained. These findings indicate thatover and above prior knowledge, metaconceptual reflection on Knowledge Building contributed to conceptualchange. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;discussion&#34;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findingssupport  the  increased  emphasis  on  social  construction  of science knowledge,  and  specifically  it  supports  thenotion  that  collective  knowledge  building  mediated  by  Knowledge  Forum  have  positive  effects  on  learningscience (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;experimental students now tend to view knowledge not as discrete facts but complex knowledge that does notonly reside in external authority but can be constructed and derived from multiple sources. The findings alsosuggest  that  knowledge-building  students  are  more  likely  to  hold  the  view  that  knowledge  is  not  static  butchangeable and extendable over time. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such  beliefs  seemed  highly  consistent  with  the  kinds  of  beliefs  to  be  fostered  in  a  collaborative knowledge-building community – When students work together to construct new understanding, they would be able  to  see  knowledge  as  constructed  collaboratively  and  that  knowledge  can  be  advanced,  improved  and extended.  There  is  considerable  work  on  roles  of  epistemological  beliefs  in  science  learning  (e.g.,  Hofer &amp;amp; Pintrinch, 2003). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We extended earlier research to conceptualchange  for  high-school  students  in  a  complex  domain  of  electrochemistry;  we  examined  conceptual  changemore  systematically  designing  tasks  that  tapped  students’  misconceptions. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results are consistent with earlier research on knowledge building discourse in elementary students’ scientific understanding (Hakkarainen, 2004; Zhang et al., 2007). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For  epistemological  change,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  extent  to  which  students  engaged  in Knowledge  Forum  collaborative  activity  (reading  and  linking  more  notes)  contributed to  belief  change. It  is possible that students who read more and made more links and references to others’ notes might see knowledge as more complex and extendable. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings  suggest  the  important  role  of  knowledge-building  process  contributing  to  deep  conceptual understanding. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epistemological  beliefs  were  correlated  with  several measures of preand post-test exam and conceptual-change question scores. We also found that students with more  sophisticated  beliefs were  engaged  in  deeper  reflection  and  inquiry.  These patterns  are  consistent  with current research on roles of epistemological beliefs on learning and conceptual change (e.g., Mason &amp;amp; Scirica, (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clippings&#34;&gt;Clippings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game-Like Learning (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;knowledge: as noun and verb (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory of learning in many schools today is based on what I would call the “content fetish” (Gee 2004). The content fetish is the view that any academic area (whether physics, sociology, or history) is composed of a set of facts or a body of information and that the way learning should work is through teaching and testing such facts and information. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“know” is a verb before it is a noun, “knowledge” (Barsalou 1999a, 1999b; Bereiter and Scardamalia 1993; Clark 1997; Glenberg 1997; Glenberg and Robertson 1999; Lave and Wenger 1991; Rogoff 1990). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any actual domain of knowledge, academic or not, is first and foremost a set of activities (special ways of acting and interacting so as to produce and use knowledge) and experiences (special ways of seeing, valuing, and being in the world). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fruitful patterns or generalizations in any domain are those that are best recognized by those who already know how to look at the domain and how the complex variables at play in the domain interrelate with each other. This is precisely what the learner does not yet know. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An interesting comment KB will not agree with.&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as we have already said, simply turning learners loose to engage in the domain’s activities won’t work either, because newcomers don’t know how to start, where to look for the best leverage, and which generalizations to draw or how long to pursue them before giving them up for alternatives. Of course, we can hardly expect learners to reinvent for themselves domains that took thousands of people and hundreds of years to develop. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paradox has lead some educators, over the last few years, to search for what I would call “post-progressive pedagogies”; that is, pedagogies that combine immersion with well-designed guidance (e.g., Brown 1994; Lehrer 2003; Lehrer and Schauble 2005; Martin 1990). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;good video games and related types of simulations can play in learning inside and outside schools (e.g., Barab et al. 2005; Barab et al. in press; Gee 2003a, 2005; Jenkins and Squire 2004; Shaffer 2007; Squire 2005, 2006; Steinkuehler 2004, 2006). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will point out that the dilemma we discussed earlier – between knowledge as information and knowledge as activity and experience – is related to another dilemma familiar from recent research on cognition: the dilemma between general, abstract, and verbal understandings, on the one hand, and situated understandings, on the other. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A situated understanding of a concept or word implies the ability to use the word or understand the concept in ways that are customizable to different specific situations of use (Brown, Collins, and Dugid 1989; Clark 1989, 1993, 1997; Gee 2004). A general or verbal understanding implies an ability to explicate one’s understanding in terms of other words or general principles but not necessarily an ability to apply this knowledge to actual situations. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in cognitive science has shown, for example, that it is perfectly possible to understand Newton’s laws as formulas, realizing their deductive capacities in a general way, but not be able to actually draw these deductions and apply them to a concrete case in actual practice to solve a real-world problem (Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser 1981; Gardner 1991). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all human understandings are, in reality, situated. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verbal and general understandings are top-down. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situated understandings generally work in the other direction; understanding starts with a relatively concrete case and gradually rises to higher levels of abstraction through the consideration of additional cases. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;knowledge as activity and experience before knowledge as facts and information (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the possibility that what we might call “game-like” learning through digital technologies can facilitate situated understandings in the context of activity and experience grounded in perception (Games-to-Teach Team 2003; Gee 2003a; McFarlane, Sparrowhawk, and Heald 2002; Squire 2003).

&lt;p&gt;Andy diSessa’s (2000) work is a good example, in science education, of building on and from specific cases to teach situated understandings. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DiSessa has successfully taught children in sixth grade and beyond the algebra behind Galileo’s principles of motion by teaching them a specific computer programming language called Boxer. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students write into the computer a set of discrete steps in the programming language. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the program starts running, the student will see a graphical object move one meter per second repeatedly, a form of uniform motion. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student can keep elaborating the program and watch what happens at every stage. In this process, the student, with the guidance of a good teacher, can discover a good deal about Galileo’s principles of motion through his or her actions in writing the program, watching what happens, and changing the program. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an embodied way, tied to action, how a representational system that is less abstract than algebra or calculus (namely, the computer programming language, which is actually composed of a set of boxes) “cashes out” in terms of motion in a virtual world on the computer screen (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DiSessa does not actually refer to his work with Boxer as game-like learning, though some people pushing the design of actual games for learning have been inspired, in part, by his approach to learning and science education (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supercharged! (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurt Squire and his colleagues (Squire et al. 2004; see also Jenkins, Squire, and Tan 2003; Squire 2003) have worked on a computer game called Supercharged! to help students learn physics. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an electromagnetism simulation game developed in consultation with MIT physicist John Belcher by the Games-to-Teach project at MIT (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;placing charged particles and controlling a ship that navigates by altering its charge. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game play consists of two phases: planning and playing. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each level contains obstacles common to electromagnetism texts. These include points of charge, planes of charge, magnetic planes, solid magnets, and electric currents. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squire et al. (2004) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, the experimental group outperformed the control group on conceptual examination questions. Post-interviews revealed that both experimental and control students had improved their understanding of basic electrostatics. However, there were some qualitative differences between the two groups. The most striking differences were in students’ descriptions of electric fields and the influence of distance on the forces that charges experience. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the teachers came to realize that students were initially playing Supercharged! without a good deal of critical reflection on their play. The teachers then created log sheets for their students to record their actions and make predictions, which reinforced the purpose of the activity and encouraged students to detect patterns in their play. Later, the teachers provided even more structure, using the projector to display game levels, encouraging the class to interpret the events happening onscreen and make predictions about how they thought the simulation would behave. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Spectrum Warrior (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a plethora of people today who want to make “serious games” for learning (for more information, see www.seriousgames.org or www. educationarcade.org). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good commercial games are more or less forced to incorporate good principles of learning (Gee 2003a). Today’s video games are long, complex, and hard – and avid players would not have it any other way. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;deep learning involves, first and foremost, activity and experience, not facts and information. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large body of facts that resist out-ofcontext memorization and rote learning comes free of charge if learners are immersed in activities and experiences that use these facts for plans, goals, and purposes within a coherent knowledge domain (Shaffer 2004). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;simply turning learners loose to engage in the domain’s activities won’t work either. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our schools are still locked into endless and pointless battles between “traditionalism” and “progressivism,” between overt teaching and immersive learning, between skill-and-drill and activities, as though these were the only two alternatives. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many good commercial video games are based on a theory of learning I will call “distributed authentic professionalism,” a theory that resolves our paradox quite nicely (see also Shaffer 2004, 2007). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Spectrum Warrior (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this game is ideologically laden. It carries messages, beliefs, and values about war, warfare, terrorism, cultural differences, the U.S. military, and the role of the United States and its army in the modern, global world. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Spectrum Warrior has its origins in a U.S. Army training simulation, but the commercial game retains only about 15% of what was in the Army’s simulation (Buchanan 2004, 150). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Spectrum Warrior teaches the player (yes, it is a teacher) how to be a professional soldier. It demands that the player think, value, and act like one to “win” the game. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These additional skills are a version of the professional practice of modern soldiers – the professional skills of a soldie (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;soldier commanding a dismounted light infantry squad composed of two teams. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everything about your squad &amp;hellip; is the result of careful planning and years of experience on the battlefield. Respect that experience, soldier, since it’s what will keep your soldiers alive” (p. 2). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtual characters in the game (the soldiers in the squads), on the one hand, and the real-world player, on the other hand, control different parts of the domain of professional military expertise. We get the whole domain only when we put their knowledge together. The knowledge is distributed between them. A human being (the player) shares knowledge with a virtual reality (the soldiers). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game only works when the two different bits are put together – thought about and acted on – as a whole by the player who uses the virtual soldiers as smart tools or resources (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player is also scaffolded by some quite explicit instruction given “just in time, (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learner is not left to his or her own devices to rediscover the foundations of a professional practice that took hundreds of years to develop. Our paradox is solved. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“authentic professionalism.” Authentic professionals have special knowledge and distinctive values tied to specific skills gained through a good deal of effort and experience (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, professionals welcome challenges at the cutting edge of their expertise (Bereiter and Scardamalia 1993). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will be the values in a KB game?&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What all of these games exemplify, though, is that there is no real learning without some ideology. Adopting a certain set of values and a particular worldview is intimately connected to performing the activities and having the experiences that constitute any specific domain of knowledge. Physicists hold certain values and adopt a specific worldview because their knowledge making is based on seeing and valuing the world in certain ways. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good school-based learning experience that followed the Full Spectrum Warrior model would have to pick its domain of authentic professionalism well, intelligently select the skills and knowledge to be distributed, build in a related value system as integral to learning, and give explicit instruction only (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“just in time” or “on demand.” David Shaffer’s “epistemic games,” one of which we will discuss below, exemplify this approach. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;augmented by reality: madison 2020 (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madison 2020 project (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a game-like simulation that simulates some of the activities of professional urban planners (Beckett and Shaffer 2004; see also Shaffer et al. 2004) (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaffer and Beckett’s game is not a stand-alone entity but is used as part of a larger learning system. Shaffer and Beckett call their approach to gamelike learning “augmented by reality,” because a virtual reality – that is, the game simulation – is augmented or supplemented by real-world activities; in this case, further activities of the sort in which urban planners engage. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the game SimCity, in Shaffer and Beckett’s game, students make landuse decisions and consider the complex results of their decisions. However, unlike in SimCity, they use real-world data and authentic planning practices to inform those decisions. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;based on David Shaffer’s theory of pedagogical praxis, a theory that argues that modeling learning environments on authentic professional practices – in this case, the practices of urban planners – enables young people to develop deeper understandings of important domains of inquiry (Shaffer 2004). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis, however, is not on professions as vocations but as domains of expertise that recruit important ways of knowing and producing knowledge; thus, Shaffer calls his games “epistemic games” (Shaffer 2007). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaffer and Beckett’s Madison 2020 project situated student experience at a micro level by focusing on a single street in their own city (Madison, Wisconsin): (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high school students Shaffer and Beckett worked with had volunteered for a ten-hour workshop (run over two weekend days) focused on city planning and community service. At the beginning of the workshop, the students were given an urban planning challenge: They were asked to create a detailed redesign plan for State Street, a major pedestrian thoroughfare in Madison, a street quite familiar to all of the students in the workshop. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students then watched a video about State Street, featuring interviews with people who expressed concerns about the street’s redevelopment aligned with the issues in the informational packet (e.g., affordable housing). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;students walked to State Street and conducted a site assessment (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MadMod – the “game” in the learning system – allows students to see a virtual representation of State Street. It has two components, a decision space and a constraint table. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As students made decisions about changes they wished to make, they received immediate feedback about the consequences of changes in the constraint table. The constraint table showed the effects of changes on six planning issues raised in the original information packet and the video: crime, revenue, jobs, waste, car trips, and housing. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MadMod functions in Shaffer and Beckett’s curriculum like a game much in the way SimCity does. In my view, video games are simulations that have “win states” in terms of goals players have set for themselves. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the students have certain goals, and the game lets them see how close or far they are from attaining those goals. At the same time, the game is embedded in a learning system that ensures those goals and the procedures used to reach them are instantiations of the professional practices and ways of knowing of urban planners. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better yet, perhaps, Shaffer and Beckett were able to show transfer: Students’ responses to novel, hypothetical urban planning problems showed increased awareness of the interconnections among urban ecological issues. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;assessment: a game example (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;real-time strategy video games (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why shouldn’t learning school subjects be more like playing Rise of Nations? Why shouldn’t assessment work in school the way it does in Rise of Nations?” (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, then, would we need any assessment apart from the game itself? One reason – indeed, a reason Janie herself would – is that Janie might want to know (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the game is very complex, so this won’t be any particular score or grade. What Janie needs is a formative or developmental assessment that can let her theorize her play and change it for the better, and this is what the game gives her. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of any play session in Rise of Nations, the player does not just get the message “you win” or “you lose,” but rather a dozen charts and graphs detailing a myriad of aspects of her activities and strategies across the whole time span of her play (and her civilization’s life). This gives Janie a more abstract view of her play; it models her play session and gets her to see her play session as one “type” of game, one way to play the game against other ways. It gives her a meta-representation of the game and her game play in terms of which she can become a theoretician of her own play and learning. From this information, she does not learn just to be faster or “better”; she (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learns how to think strategically about the game in ways that allow her to transform old strategies and try out new ones. She comes to see the game as a system of interconnected relationships. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janie will see herself compared, at each stage of the game play, with the other players (real people or the computer) in each chart and graph: (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janie uses these charts and graphs – they are part of the game play, part of the fun of the game – to understand where things went right and where they went wrong, where things can be improved and where no change is needed (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can even look at the charts and graphs and conclude, not that there were weaknesses in her performance, but that she won by a certain style and would like now to try another one. This is formative or developmental assessment at its best. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;implications (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, “fair” may not be the right word here, as Pullin has pointed out to me (personal communication). As she points out, “things can be fair; that is, equitably distributed, but offered at a very low level.” (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She prefers the term “meaningful opportunity to learn” rather than “fair opportunity to learn.” (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when students engage in situated learning of the sort discussed here, facts and information eventually “come free” (e.g., Gee 2003a; Shaffer 2007). (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Gasevic2014-ki&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gasevic, D., Kovanovic, V., Joksimovic, S., &amp;amp; Siemens, G. (2014). Where is research on massive open online courses headed? A data analysis of the MOOC Research Initiative. The International Review Of Research In Open And Distributed Learning, 15(5), 134–176.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This review is unique compared to typical literature analysis as it focuses on grant proposals submitted to the MRI initiative. Applying a wide range of analytical techniques, this paper uncovers key themes, leading authors (being cited in proposals), representation of disciplines, status of interdisciplinarity, and the impact of the breadth of coverage (defined by SNA measures of resulting citation networks within clusters of disciplines) on likelihood of being funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;: Unique and interesting analysis tackling on various research questions. Helpful to be considered together with Veletsianos (2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing with the citation network in this paper, is that it treats co-authorship and citation with equal status when constructing networks. A future direction is to decouple them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper reports on the results of an analysis of the research proposals submitted to the MOOC Research Initiative (MRI) funded by the Gates Foundation and administered by Athabasca University. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results revealed the main research themes that could form a framework of the future MOOC research: i) student engagement and learning success, ii) MOOC design and curriculum, iii) self-regulated learning and social learning, iv) social network analysis and networked learning, and v) motivation, attitude and success criteria. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The submissions were dominated by the researchers from the field of education (75% of the accepted proposals). Not only was this a possible cause of a complete lack of success of the educational technology innovation theme, but it could be a worrying sign of the fragmentation in the research community and the need to increased efforts towards enhancing interdisciplinarity. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distance education and online learning have been clearly demonstrated to be an effective option to traditional classroom learning1. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is an exploration of MOOCs; what they are, how they are reflected in literature, who is doing research, the types of research being undertaken, and finally, why the hype of MOOCs has not yet been reflected in a meaningful way on campuses around the world. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we are confident that the conve rsation about how MOOCs and online learning will impact existing higher education can be moved from a hype and hope argument to one that is more empirical and research focused. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public conversation following this MOOC was unusual for the education field where innovations in teaching and learning are often presented in university press releases or academic journals. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research communities have also formed around learning at scale 4 suggesting that while the public conversation around MOOCs may be fading, the research community continues to apply lessons learned from MOOCs to educational settings. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, there are potential insights to be gained into the trajectory of online learning in general by assessing the citation networks, academic disciplines, and focal points of research into existing MOOCs. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOOC Research (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the early research into MOOCs has been in the form of institutional reports by early MOOC projects (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, some peer reviewed articles have explored th e experience of learners (Breslow et al., 2013; Kizilcec, Piech, &amp;amp; Schneider, 2013; Liyanagunawardena, Adams, &amp;amp; Williams, 2013). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We settled on using the MOOC Research Initiative as our dataset. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOOC Research Initiative (MRI) (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific topic areas that the MRI initiative targeted included: i) student experiences and outcomes; ii) cost, performance metrics and learner analytics; iii) MOOCs: policy and systemic impact; and iv) alternative MOOC formats (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Objectives (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we report the findings of an exploratory study in which we investigated (a) the themes in the MOOC research emerging in the MRI proposals; (b) research methods commonly proposed for use in the proposals submitted to the MRI initiative, &amp;copy; demographics (educational background and geographic location) characteristics of the authors who participated in the MRI initiative; (d) most influential authors and references cited in the proposals submitted in the MRI initiative; and (e) the factors that were associated with the success of proposals to be accepted for funding in the MRI initiative. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content Analysis (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both automated a) and manual b) content analyses. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated content analysis of research themes and trends. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;through the use of scientometric methods (Brent, 1984; Cheng et al., 2014; Hoonlor, Szymanski, &amp;amp; Zaki, 2013; Kinshuk, Huang, Sampson, &amp;amp; Chen, 2013; Li, 2010; Sari, Suharjito, &amp;amp; Widodo, 2012) (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among different techniques, t he one based on the word co-occurrence (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;has been gaining the widespread adoption in the recent literature reviews of educational research (Chang, Chang, &amp;amp; Tseng, 2010; Cheng et al., 2014). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we based our analysis approach on the work of Chang et al. (2010) and Cheng et al. (2014). Generally speaking, our content analysis consisted of the three main phases: 1. extraction of relevant key concepts from each submission, 2. clustering submissions to the important research themes, and 3. in- depth analysis of the produced clusters. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For extraction of key concepts from each submission, we selected Alchemy, a platform for semantic analyses of text that allows for extraction of the informative and relevant set of concepts of importance for addressing research objective c, (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allowed us to rank the concepts and select the top 50 ranked (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the concept extraction, we used the agglomerative hierarchical clustering in order to define N groups of similar submissions that represent the N important research themes and trends in MOOC research, as aimed in research objective c. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our representation of each submission was a vector of concepts that appeared in a particular submission (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a large submission-concept matrix where each row represented one submission, and each column represented one concept, while the values in the matrix (MIJ) represented the relevance of a particular concept J for a document I. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we used the popular cosine similarity which is essentially a cosine of the angle θ between the two submissions in the N-dimensional space defined by all unique concepts. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the GAAClusterer (i.e., Group Average Agglomerative) hierarchical clustering algorithm from the NLTK python library (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to assess the produced clusters and select the key concepts in each cluster, we created a concept-graph consisting of the important concepts from each cluster. The nodes in a graph were concepts discovered in a particular cluster, while the links between them were made based on the co-occurrence of the concepts (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content analysis of important characteristics of authors and submissions. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content analysis afforded for a systematic approach to collect data about the research methods and the background of the authors. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, each submission was categorized into one of the four categories (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;qualitative method, which meant that the proposal used a qualitative research method such as grounded theory; 2. quantitative method, which meant that a proposal followed some of the quantitative research methods on data collected through (Likert-scale based) surveys or digital traces recorded by learning platforms in order to explore different phenomena or test hypotheses; 3. mixed-methods, which reflected a research proposals that applied some combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods; 4. other, which comprised of the research proposals that did not explicitly follow any of these methods, or it was not possible to determine from their content which of the three methods they planned to use. (p. 8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;their home discipline and the geographic location (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citation Analysis and Success Factors (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It entailed the investigation of the research impact of the authors and papers cited in the proposals submitted to the MRI initiative (Waltman, van Eck, &amp;amp; Wouters, 2013). In doing so, the counts of citations of each reference and author, cited in the MRI proposals, are used as the measures of the impact in the citation analysis. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citation network analysis – the analysis of s0 -called co-authorship and citation networks have gained much adoption lately (Tight, 2008) – was performed in order to assess the success factor of individual proposals to be accepted for funding in the MRI initiative (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social network analysis was used to address research objective e. In this study, social networks were created through the links established based on the citation and co- authoring relationships, (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actors occupying central networks nodes are typically associated with the higher degree of success, innovation, and creative potential (Burt, Kilduff, &amp;amp; Tasselli, 2013; Dawson, Tan, &amp;amp; McWilliam, 2011). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nodes in the network represent the authors of both submissions and cited references, while links are created based on the co-authorship and citing relations. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more ideally could be a two-mode social network (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a citation network for each cluster separately and analyzed them by the following three measures (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All social networking measures were computed using the Gephi (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 Results (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, there were nine research themes with a sim ilar number of submissions, from 19 (i.e., “Mooc Platforms” research theme) to 40 (i.e., “Communities” and “Social Networks” research themes). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half of the papers from the “Social Networks” research theme moved to the second phase and finally 25% of them were accepted for funding, while none of the submissions from the “Education Technology Improvements” theme was accepted for funding. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the most common research methodology type is mixed research, while the purely qualitative research is the least frequent. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 citation analysis. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows the list of most cited authors, while Table 8 shows the list of most cited papers in the first phase of the MRI initiative. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 success factors. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at the correlations between the centrality measures of citation networks (Table 9) and the second phase acceptance rates. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting approach. Why would they be correlated? (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results confirmed the expectation stated i n the citation analysis section that research proposals with the broader scope of the covered literature were more likely to be assessed by the international review board as being of higher quality and importance. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting interpretation. If the networks were constructed for each cluster, the size of the cluster could be a varialbe as well. Also, the interpretation of diameter/path length could go either way: coverage, or disconnectedness.  (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2 Results (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2 research themes. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research theme 1: engagement and learning success (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main topics in this cluster are related to learners’ participation, engagement, and behavioral patterns in MOOCs. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research theme 2: MOOC design and curriculum (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research theme 3: Self-regulated learning and social learning (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing cognitive (e.g. , memory capacity and previous knowledge), learning strategies and motivational factors, the proposals from this cluster aimed to identify potential trajectories that could reveal students at risk. Moreover, this cluster addressed issues of intellectual property and digital literacy. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research theme 4: SNA and networked learning (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research theme 5: Motivation, attitude and success criteria (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2 research methods. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mixed methods was the most common methodological approach followed by purely quantitative research (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research design.  (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2 demographic characteristics of the authors. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2 citation analysis. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the centre of the network is L. Pappano, the author of a very popular New York Times article “The Year of the MOOC” (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also analyzed citation networks for each research theme independently and extracted common network properties such as diameter, average degree, path and density (Table 17). (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging Themes in MOOC Research (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results also confirmed that social aspects of learning in MOOCs were the most successful theme in the MRI initiative (see Table 9). (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Methods in MOOC Research (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high use of mixed methods is a good indicator of sound research plans that recognized the magnitude of complexity of the issues related to MOOCs (Greene, Caracelli, &amp;amp; Graham, 1989) . (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that most of the proposals planned to use conventional data sources and data collection methods such as grades, surveys on assessments, and interviews. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learning analytic and educational data mining (LA/EDM) (Baker &amp;amp; Yacef, 2009; Siemens &amp;amp; Gašević, 2012) (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the most successful themes (Clusters 3-4 in Phase 2) in the MRI initiative had a higher tendency to use the LA/EDM methods than other themes. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importance of Interdisciplinarity in MOOC Research (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an overwhelmingly low balance between different disciplines (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ould this be a sign of the networks to which the leaders of the MRI initiative were able to reach out? Or, is this a sign of fragmentation in the community? Although not conclusive, some signs of fragmentation could be traced. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learning at scale indicate that the conference was dominated by computer scientists 8. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fragmentation would be unfortunate for advancing understanding of a phenomenon such as MOOCs in particular and education and learning in general, which require strong interdisciplinary teams (Dawson et al., 2014). (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research needs to come up with theoretical underpinnings that will explain factors related to social aspects in MOOCs that have a completely new context and offer practical guidance of course design and instruction (e.g., Clusters 2, 4, and 5 in Phase 2). (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connection with learning theory has also been recognized as another important feature of the research proposals submitted to MRI (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new educational context of MOOCs triggered research for novel course and curriculum design principles as reflected in Cluster 2 of Phase 2. Through the increased attention to social learning, (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is important to note that the majority of the authors of the proposals submitted to the MRI were from North America, followed by the authors from Europe, Asia, and Australia. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the exciting combination of consumption and creation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all video games are rule systems about shapes, movements, and combinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but what would happen if I gave each shape, movement, and combination of shapes in Tetris a meaning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;story elements: actors, actions; states, events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grammar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;games as literacy
  * what&amp;rsquo;s the role of story in games?
  * Casovilia: story doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
  * The primary thing here is the player&amp;rsquo;s production of story elements, not a story per se (like Alucard kills a Sword Lord). But the little events you&amp;rsquo;re doing. A set of acts, and a set of meanings not enough to create a deep story.
  * Video games allows players to have all kinds of choices, but designers cannot prepare every possible choices beforehand. So what makes video games playable is the players make meanings..
  * &amp;ldquo;video games cannot be art.&amp;rdquo; -someone
  * Gee disagrees.
  * The marriage of rules and story elements allows two quite different stories to exist: the Designer&amp;rsquo;s story, and the virtual-real story (player&amp;rsquo;s trajectory through the game).
  * the second one is more important.
  * everyone go through the game differently. the example of killing a lord in a game: different trajectory.
  * the example of WoW when players going back to a place, they thought about before. a personal history. building meanings when playing. personal trajectory. doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in reading books. so players&amp;rsquo; story, own projection of their story important, not the designer of the games.
  * the possiblity of creating a world in which each person&amp;rsquo;s trajectory is important; each person is different, each person lay down a deap past of his own that can be compared or contrasted with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive approaches in games
  * modern psychology: emotional component in thinking
  * give information emotional charge &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; better stored and learning more deeply; emotional attachment
  * the problem of schooling
  * games can trigger emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who is playing the game?
  * virtual and real characters. melding of computer character and person.
  * psychology: people feels go as far as body goes.
  * in games, control is part of deep pleasure.
  * virtual and real have their own skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional experience
  * army game
  * you command soldiers to do things
  * the characters know a lot of things. but you need to make the right command.
  * solders
  * i (player) can start from zero knowledge, to build my professional knowledge by playing. because they know a lot.
  * by the time of getting good at it, i contribute more.
  * constrains.
  * soldiers &amp;lt;-militery experience &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; player
  * share professional expereince
  * start before competence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the good model of helping people develop professional knowledge. but only used in training people to kill.
not killing people, but things like urben planning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three stories:
1. the designer&amp;rsquo;s story
2. the virtual-real story
3. the virtual-real career story&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @piaget1970genetic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piaget&amp;rsquo;s presents a &amp;ldquo;genetic epistemology&amp;rdquo; in that he elaborates how our understanding of knowledge (epistemology) develops in actual people (children) instead of simply as an abstract philosophy based on our adult intuitions about knowledge (the traditional epistemological approach).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jean Piaget, genetic epistemology &amp;ldquo;attempts to explain knowledge, and in particular scientific knowledge, on the basis of its history, its sociogenesis, and especially the psychological origins of the notions and operations upon which it is based&amp;rdquo;. Piaget believed he could test epistemological questions by studying the development of thought and action in children. As a result Piaget created a field known as genetic epistemology with its own methods and problems. He defined this field as the study of child development as a means of answering epistemological questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENETIC EPISTEMOLOGY attempts to explain knowledge, and in particular scientific knowledge, on the basis of its history, its sociogenesis, and especially the psychological origins of the notions and operations upon which it is based. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description that I have given of the nature of genetic epistemology runs into a major problem, namely, the traditional philosophical view of epistemology. For many philosophers and epistemologists, epistemology is the study of knowledge as it exists at the present moment; it is the analysis of knowledge for its own sake and within its own framework without regard for its development. For these persons, tracing the development of ideas or (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the development of operations may be of interest to historians or to psychologists but is of no direct concern to epistemologists. This is the major objection to the discipline of genetic epistemology, which I have outlined here. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current state of knowledge is a moment in history, changing just as rapidly as the state of knowledge in the past has ever changed and, in many instances, more rapidly. Scientific thought, then, is not momentary; it is not a static instance; it is a process. More specifically, it is a process of continual construction and reorganisation. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our problem, from the point of view of psychology and from the point of view of genetic epistemology, is to explain how the transition is made from a lower level of knowledge to a level that is judged to be higher. The nature of these transitions is a factual question. The transitions are historical or psychological or sometimes even biological, as I shall attempt to show later. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Goel2014&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goel, S., &amp;amp; Goldstein, D. G. (2014). Predicting Individual Behavior with Social Networks. Marketing Science, 33(1), 82–93. doi:10.1287/mksc.2013.0817&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, online marketers have predicted behavior at the individual level using variables such as age and sex (demographic targeting), location (geographic targeting), and website usage patterns (behavioral targeting). Today, ad servers can respond to the text of the page being viewed, be it a news story or personal email, and deliver ads on the fly that match page content (contextual targeting). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After so many years of advances, the baseline models for predicting consumer behavior have become strong. Nonetheless, new sources of data will continually beg the question of the degree to which targeting can be improved. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main empirical and theoretical questions we address are how much information there is in the edges of a network and whether that information improves on baseline models for selecting individuals likely to undertake various actions. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a handful of studies in related disciplines have shown that friends of adopters are themselves more likely to adopt, even after controlling for covariates (Bhatt et al. 2010, Hill et al. 2006, Provost et al. 2009). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question this previous research leaves open is whether, in practice, social network targeting is an effective strategy, as the number of people with an adopting contact may be exceedingly small. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess the value of social predictors, we examine individual-level behaviors in three diverse domains comprising 12 distinct outcomes: responding to national advertisements for 10 products and services, participating in an online recreational league with millions of players, and purchasing (off-line and online) from a national department store chain. We treat each domain in turn, and within a domain we test baseline models that range from extremely simple (using social network data or demographic data alone) to strong (adding social network data to models that include demographics as well as individuallevel transactional data). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Response to Advertising (p. 4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis is based on individuals within the Yahoo! communications network, where we establish an edge between all pairs of people who mutually exchanged email or instant messages during a fixed two-month period. Restricting analysis to those individuals with at least one correspondent resulted in a symmetric network of 132 million people and 719 million edges, with a mean of 11 contacts per individual. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest increase was observed for Movie 1, where people whose social contacts clicked on this ad were more than 10 times as likely (1,140%) to click than those without contacts who clicked. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, consistent with past studies (Aral et al. 2009, Bhatt et al. 2010, Hill et al. 2006, Provost et al. 2009), contacts of adopters are themselves more likely than average to adopt, and in at least some of the campaigns we examined, this social signal is quite strong. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 1 indicates, the social signal allows one to construct pools of between 10,000 and 100,000 candidates who are much more likely than average to click, where the size of these pools effectively reflects the number of individuals connected to people who clicked. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we have thus far seen that social data on their own may not be particularly useful for identifying individuals likely to click on ads, it is often the case that social data are not the only resource available for targeting. As a case in point, Yahoo! collects age and sex for each of its registered users and routinely uses this information for ad targeting. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That contacts of those who clicked have relatively high click rates does not in itself imply that social data are valuable for prediction, in part because few people may be connected to individuals who clicked. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many contexts, the central objective is to identify pools of individuals most likely to take action. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thus assess the predictive value of social data via a top-k analysis (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the effectiveness of demographic data to predict clicking on advertisements, do social data substantively improve on demographics in constructing pools of likely adopters? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess the marginal value of social data relative to demographic information, we generate two candidate rankings, one based only on demographic attributes and the other based (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on both demographic and social information. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, of the total candidate set of approximately eight million people, demographic information is generally useful for constructing pools of up to several million individuals that are substantially more likely than average to click. Second, even on top of this baseline, augmenting demographic information with social data often helps to identify pools of between 10,000 and 100,000 (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recreational League Registrations (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retail Purchases (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a relatively small set; consequently, the reach of social targeting strategies may be small. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion and Conclusion (p. 12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to our motivating question, we find that there are a variety of circumstances in which social data are useful for identifying select groups of individuals with relatively high propensities to take various actions, from clicking on advertisements, to registering for a recreational league, to making department store purchases. Across all three domains we study, mere connection to an individual who has previously taken such an action is indicative of a higher than average propensity to act oneself. We also find that social data are not only useful in isolation but also often complement both demographic and behavioral predictors. In particular, social predictors substantially augmented demographic-based candidate selection in the shopping and fantasy football domains. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when detailed transaction data were available—as in the retail domain—we find social data provide almost no marginal benefit. More generally, it seems likely that when enough information is available at the individual level, the marginal value of network data is muted. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, social data seem particularly valuable in situations where a potential target’s social network is known but information about his or her past behavior, and possibly demographic characteristics, is limited. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social data have proven to be widely effective in the examples we study, but there are limits to their benefits. Specifically, when relatively few people undertake a particular action, and when individuals have few contacts, the contacts of these initial actors form (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we note that the marketing literature we have reviewed has focused on the topic of proving, disentangling, or modeling causality in social networks. It may be tempting to conclude from our results that shopping habits or leisure activities are “contagious.” Although social influence likely plays a role in effects we find, establishing such is neither our objective nor justified from our analysis. Nevertheless, whereas the value of social data may concern both influence and homophily, our approach demonstrates that disentangling the two is not necessary for identifying and targeting likely adopters. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Graesser2011&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graesser, A. C., McNamara, D. S., &amp;amp; Kulikowich, J. M. (2011). Coh-Metrix: Providing Multilevel Analyses of Text Characteristics. Educational Researcher, 40(5), 223–234. doi:10.3102/0013189X11413260&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of measures provided by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cohmetrix.com/&#34;&gt;Coh-Metrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two important caveats must be raised before describing the computer analyses of text characteristics. First, computers obviously cannot identify and scale texts on all levels of language, discourse, and meaning. Available computer systems cannot fully comprehend the deep metaphors, literary devices, and historical contexts of Shakespeare’s plays, for example. Some characteristics of texts require humans to provide informed, deep, critical analyses. Second, successful text comprehension involves much more than an analysis of text characteristics alone because prior knowledge, inference mechanisms, and skills of readers are also critically important (Graesser, Singer, &amp;amp; Trabasso, 1994; McNamara et al., in press; Pressley, Wood, Woloshyn, Martin, King, &amp;amp; Menke, 1992; Snow, 2002). (p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional Computer Metrics ofText Ease/Difficulty (p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach to scaling texts is to have a single metric of text ease or difficulty. This is the approach taken by the three most popular metrics, namely Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level or Reading Ease (Klare, 1974–1975), Degrees of Reading Power (DRP; Koslin, Zeno, &amp;amp; Koslin, 1987), and Lexile scores (Stenner, 2006). (p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coh-Metrix Analyses on Multiple Levels of Language and Discourse (p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of a single dimension of text difficulty (p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coh-Metrix was developed to analyze texts on multiple characteristics and levels of language-discourse. The original inspiration in developing Coh-Metrix was to have an automated metric of text cohesion (hence the label Coh-Metrix). (p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flesch-Kincaid metrics (Grade Level and Reading Ease) are based on the length of words and length of sentences. For example, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is computed as 11.8 * Syllables + .39 * Words − 15.59. Word length is measured as the mean number of syllables per word (which is highly correlated with number of letters); sentence length is the mean number of words per sentence. (p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures of Coh-Metrix are aligned with various language-discourse levels proposed in multilevel theoretical frameworks (Graesser &amp;amp; McNamara, 2011; Kintsch, 1998; Snow, 2002). These theoretical frameworks identify the representations, structures, strategies, and processes at different levels of language and discourse. Five levels have frequently been proposed in these frameworks: (1) words, (2) syntax, (3) the explicit textbase, (4) the situation model (sometimes called the mental model), and (5) the discourse genre and rhetorical structure (the type of discourse and its composition). A sixth level of pragmatic communication between speaker and listener, or writer and reader, is often also included, but this level is not tightly connected with text characteristics and will not be addressed in this article. The five levels are elaborated later and in Graesser and McNamara (2011). (p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DRP and Lexile scores relate characteristics of the texts to performance of readers in a cloze task. In the cloze task, the reader receives the text with words left blank and is asked to fill in the words by generating them or by selecting a word from a set of options. A text is at the reader’s level of proficiency if the reader can perform the cloze task at a corresponding threshold of performance (e.g., 75%). (p. 224)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large suite of measures ends up nicely funneling into factors that are aligned with Levels 1–5 of the multilevel theoretical framework (Graesser &amp;amp; McNamara, 2011). It is beyond the scope of this article to specify precisely how each measure is computed. (p. 225)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words (p. 225)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word frequency. Words that occur with a higher frequency in the English language are more familiar to the reader, are processed more quickly, and are linked to richer bodies of world knowledge (Beck et al., 2002; Haberlandt &amp;amp; Graesser, 1985; Perfetti, 2007). Word frequency in Coh-Metrix is computed from multiple corpora of texts that we have documented in Coh-Metrix publications. The logarithm of word frequency is computed because reading times are linearly related to the logarithm of word frequency, not to raw word frequencies (Haberlandt &amp;amp; Graesser, 1985; Just &amp;amp; Carpenter, 1987). (p. 225)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is important to analyze words on multiple characteristics that have relevance to reading development and construction of meaning. (p. 225)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts of speech. Each word is assigned a syntactic part-of-speech category. These syntactic categories are segregated into content words (such as nouns, main verbs, adjectives, adverbs) and function words (e.g., prepositions, determiners, pronouns). (p. 225)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychological ratings. Coh-Metrix measures words on characteristics in an established psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981), a collection of ratings of thousands of words along several psychological dimensions: age of acquisition, meaningfulness, concreteness, imagability, and familiarity. (p. 225)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic content. The semantic content of words is analyzed by semantic categories provided by WordNet (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, &amp;amp; Miller, 1990), a large lexicon with words annotated by experts on linguistic and psychological features. (p. 225)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coh-Metrix computes the relative frequency of each word category (both syntactic and semantic categories, described later) by counting the number of instances of the category per 1,000 words of text. (p. 225)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some syntactic categories have repercussions at deeper levels of comprehension. (p. 225)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-reference. Coh-Metrix tracks different types of word coreference: content word overlap, noun overlap, argument overlap, and stem overlap. (p. 226)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntax (p. 226)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories of syntax assign words to part-of-speech categories (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, conjunctions), group words into phrases (noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases, clauses), and assign syntactic tree structures to sentences (Jurafsky &amp;amp; Martin, 2008). (p. 226)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lexical diversity. Lexical diversity is related to cohesion because a higher number of different words in a text means that new words need to be integrated into the discourse context. The most wellknown lexical diversity index is type-token ratio, but a number of analogous measures are included in Coh-Metrix that control for text length (McCarthy &amp;amp; Jarvis, 2007). (p. 226)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latent semantic analysis. Coh-Metrix measures conceptual overlap between sentences by a statistical model of word meaning called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA; Landauer, McNamara, Dennis, &amp;amp; Kintsch, 2007; Millis, Magliano, &amp;amp; Todaro, 2006). (p. 226)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LSA is a mathematical, statistical technique for representing word and world knowledge, based on a large corpus of texts. The central intuition is that the meaning of a word is captured by the company of other words that surround it in naturalistic documents. Two words have similarity in meaning to the extent that they share similar surrounding words. (p. 226)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentence syntax is easier when there are shorter sentences, fewer words per noun phase, fewer words before the main verb of the main clause, and fewer logic-based words. (p. 226)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Textbase (p. 226)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The textbase consists of the explicit ideas in the text: the meaning rather than the surface code of wording and syntax (Kintsch, 1998; van Dijk &amp;amp; Kintsch, 1983). (p. 226)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;content (i.e., main verbs that signal state changes, events, actions, and processes). (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situation Model (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation model is the subject matter content or the narrative world that the text is describing. In narrative text, this includes characters, objects, spatial setting, actions, events, processes, plans, thoughts and emotions of characters, and other details of the story. In informational text, the situation model is the substantive subject matter being described. (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genre and Rhetorical Structure (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genre refers to the category of text, such as whether the text is narration, exposition, persuasion, or description (Biber, 1988; Pentimonti, Zucker, Justice, &amp;amp; Kaderavek, 2010). (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zwaan and Radvansky (1998) proposed five dimensions of the situation model that apply to narrative text: causation, intentionality (goals), time, space, and protagonists. (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohesion is facilitated by these signaling devices, which clarify and stitch together the actions, goals, events, and states conveyed in the text (Louwerse, 2001). However, if the reader has enough background knowledge about the subject matter, the lack of cohesion devices may not disrupt comprehension and can sometimes improve comprehension by stimulating inferences (McNamara &amp;amp; Kintsch, 1996; O’Reilly &amp;amp; McNamara, 2007; Ozuru et al., 2009). (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coh-Metrix analyzes the extent to which a text is classified as narrative as opposed to informational. Texts cannot always be crisply categorized as one or the other; some have elements of both. (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A break in cohesion occurs when there is a discontinuity on one or more of these situation model dimensions. Whenever such discontinuities occur, it is important to have connectives, transitional phrases, adverbs, or other signaling devices that convey to the readers that there is a discontinuity; we refer to these forms of signaling as particles. Different sets of particles are associated with causal (e.g., because, enable), intentional (in order to, so that), and temporal (before, later) cohesion, although some particles may be applicable to more than one type of cohesion. Cohesion is facilitated by particles that clarify and stitch together the actions, goals, events, and states conveyed in the text. (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coh-Metrix computes the ratio of cohesion particles to the relative frequency of relevant referential (p. 227)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gruzd, A., &amp;amp; Haythornthwaite, C. (2013). Enabling community through social media. Journal of Medical Internet Research, 15(10). doi:10.2196/jmir.2796&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pescosolido [19] has suggested that a network-centered view of health, based on social network principles, can act as a bridge between medical sciences and individual health experience. Her ideas respond to an increasing recognition of the impact of connectivity and experience: “The individual is seen as embedded in an ongoing relational dynamic with sequences of events seen as patterned, contingent and emergent” (p. 196). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an analytical perspective, one of the advantages of taking a social network perspective is that the focus is on what people do with each other rather than the medium or face-to-face context through which they do it. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, friendship may be recognized by pairwise exchange of personal information and emotion, discussion of multiple topics, coparticipation in events, frequent interaction, and the use of multiple media. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic principles of social network analysis are derived from graph theory and consider actors (eg, people, organizations) as nodes in a network, connected by relations (what they do with each other, eg, provide new information, emotional support, resources, and/or services) that form interpersonal ties. The nature and variety of relations define the kind of relationship between actors, such as an acquaintanceship, friendship, learning, or work relationship. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration of connections is all-important in social networks. These structures show how actors are connected over the whole network, and thus what paths and obstacles there are for contact, information, and resource flow. Among popular aspects considered for networks are the positions of individuals (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our online interactions make these patterns more readily observable, and many examples exist now of how such patterns can be made visible, for example, in social network interaction patterns [31], patterns of text changes in wikis [32,33], and information seeking patterns (eg, Google Flu trends), each of which contributes to understanding emergent community network properties [34]. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main goals of our research is to gain a better understanding of how social media–based information and communication technologies, such as Twitter, enable a distributed group of people to form and maintain an online community. In particular, we are interested in the following research questions regarding #hcsmca: 1. Whataccountsfortherelativelongevityofthisparticularonline community? Is it because of the founder’s leadership and continuing involvement, or are there core members who are actively and persistently involved in this community? 2. Whatisthecompositionofthiscommunityingeneral?And,more specifically, does their professional role determine a person’s centrality within this community? This will allow us to understand generally how professional roles affect online conversational dynamics, and more specifically whether this online community is a welcoming place for a wide range of professionals or is, instead, dominated by professionals from a particular group. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

(p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the analysis relied on a type of network called “Name Network” [38]. The Name Network technique examines the content of the messages and connects one person to another if they mention, reply, or repost another person’s tweet [39,40]. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that the #hcsmca community is not fractionated, but rather that participants are all engaged with the single conversational network. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovering Community Leaders (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief examination of the community blog shows that, as expected, the founder of the #hcsmca group is heavily involved in planning and running the community. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three social network measures were used to locate influential individuals in this community: (1) the total number of messages contributed during the studied period, (2) the number of times a person is mentioned or replied to, that is, their @username is used in a post by someone else (in-degree centrality), and (3) the number of times a person mentions or replies to others, that is, an individual uses another person’s @username in a post (out-degree centrality). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prestige and In-Degree Centrality (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the total number of posted messages indicates only the engagement level on the part of an individual rather than the uptake of their contributions by the community. To find out whether personal messages influence others and make them reply or retweet, we examined in-degree centrality (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In examining those on this list other than the founder, we noticed that they have something in common. Most of them have a very active online presence in social media in general, not just in this community. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;online presence in social media in general, not just in this community. They are also very passionate and active commentators on health matters on Twitter. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is a weak, monotonic (nonlinear) positive correlation between the number of followers and the in-degree centrality (Spearman rho=0.23, P&amp;lt;.01). (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation of this could be that by participating in weekly discussions on #hcsmca, these individuals expose their followers to this community through their tweets on this topic (with the #hcsmca hashtag). (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influence and Out-Degree Centrality (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nother group of people who are important within any online community are people who monitor and retweet messages from others. To identify these individuals, we used the out-degree centrality (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong overlap in who is prominent in both the in-degree and out-degree lists. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests a potential method for identifying such accounts in order to exclude them from analyses of social networks: stark differences between in-degree and out-degree centrality may indicate a non-human, or non-community participant within a conversation. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actor Roles (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, we first manually classified each Twitter user in the dataset into one of 11 roles (see Table 4). (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a statistically significant relationship between professional roles and indegree centrality (explaining about 7% of the variance, P=.003, using 5000 permutations), indicating that some professional groups are more influential in this community. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we attempted to determine which professional groups were more or less likely to influence discourse in this group. Based on the average in-degree centralities for each of the 11 professional groups (see Table 5), social media health content providers were the most influential group with an average in-degree centrality of 2.89. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important observation is that although there seems to be a relationship between professional role and in-degree centrality, there is no apparent preferential attachment among people in the same professional group. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This finding was supported by an analysis of variance density test using both the Structural Blockmodel technique (it examines “whether the different classes have significantly different interaction patterns”), and also with the Variable Homophily model (which “assumes that each group or class of actors has a different homophilic tendency” [42]; where homophily is the tendency for connection based on social similarity). Based on this test (run with the 5000 permutations), the professional roles explain only 0.2% of the total variance (P=.005) when run with the Structural Blockmodel and only 0.1% (P&amp;lt;.001) with the Variable Homophily model. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;owever, this example has barely covered the beginnings of potential applications. Some key questions that remain and can form the basis of future work are: How do we implement and measure the impact of social media on health for individual patients and for the general population? What single and/or (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Guo2014-ve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guo, P. J., &amp;amp; Reinecke, K. (2014). Demographic Differences in How Students Navigate Through MOOCs. In Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference (pp. 21–30). New York, NY, USA: ACM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice study exploring demographic differences (age, gender, country origin) among MOOC learners. Interesting findings that many learners skipped a significant portion of course content, navigated in a non-linear manner, etc., pointing to opportunities for future research. However, the interpretations of some results remain debatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents an empirical study of how students navigate through MOOCs, and is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate how navigation strategies differ by demographics such as age and country of origin. We performed data analysis on the activities of 140,546 students in four edX MOOCs and found that certificate earners skip on average 22% of the course content, that they frequently employ non-linear navigation by jumping backward to earlier lecture sequences, and that older students and those from countries with lower student-teacher ratios are more comprehensive and non-linear when navigating through the course. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these findings, we suggest design recommendations such as for MOOC platforms to develop more detailed forms of certification that incentivize students to deeply engage with the content rather than just doing the minimum necessary to earn a passing grade. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
 less consideration on the actual of meaning itself, compared to the educational literature. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we hypothesized that there should be notable differences in how students navigate through the learning content depending on demographics such as age and country of origin. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DIFFERENCES IN ONLINE LEARNING STRATEGIES (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xMOOCs have been criticized for simply replicating traditional lecture-based teaching [2] and not catering to different learning strategies, such as a student’s preference for either a more or less linear structure of instructional content [20]. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in students’ approaches to learning are often described with the help of Witkin’s distinction between field-independent and field-dependent learners [24]. Fieldindependent learners predominantly approach the learning content in an analytic manner, focusing first on details before abstracting from a specific problem. In contrast, fielddependent learners first reason about context before focusing on details [24]. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Field-independent learners are believed to be fairly confident in defining their own learning paths and navigating in non-linear learning environments [9]. They are also often referred to as “explorers”, indicating that they navigate more freely without necessarily following the path suggested by content creators [17]. Field-dependent learners, in contrast, prefer following an externally defined learning path (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis Variables (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demographics (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that, in countries with a higher student-teacher ratio, students are more accustomed to a teacher-centered education and behave more like “observers” than “explorers” [11]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METHODOLOGY (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Set (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation &amp;amp; Intent (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Certificate earned – whether a student earned a certificate of completion or not. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made an anonymized version of our data set and analysis scripts publicly available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pgbovine&#34;&gt;http://www.pgbovine&lt;/a&gt;. net/edX/ so that anyone can reproduce and build upon this paper’s findings. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Grade – Students earn a grade between 0% and 100% depending on their performance on problem sets and exams. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Coverage – The fraction of total learning sequences (lectures, problem sets, and exams) that the student visited. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Discussion forum events – The number of times a student posted to the discussion forum, divided by that student’s total number of courseware access events, which controls for variability in student activity levels. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigation (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quantify the following kinds of non-linear navigation through the course materials: (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Backjumps – The number of times that this student navigated backwards from a learning sequence to another one released earlier in the term (e.g., from Lecture 6 to Lecture 4), divided by the total number of sequences visited by this student. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Textbook events – The number of times that this student accessed the digital textbook associated with the course, divided by the student’s total number of courseware access events. Since the textbook still resides within the edX website but lies outside the main flow of a course, we count textbook events as an instance of non-linear navigation. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we conducted multiple linear regression analyses and report their ANOVA F statistics, p-values, and, when applicable, the unstandardized b coefficients for each independent variable in the regression. For this paper, we do not analyze fine-grained navigation within a learning sequence. We also do not use time as a feature (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FINDINGS (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found that age distributions vary by country. In particular, students from countries with lower student-teacher ratios seem to participate in MOOCs later in life than students from countries with higher student-teacher ratios (i.e., larger class sizes). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that age and country of origin have significant effects on the fraction of sequences that certificate earners cover in all four courses (see Table 4 for a summary of the F statistics). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation &amp;amp; Intent (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age is positively correlated with coverage, even when accounting for other demographic variables (regression coefficients b = .001 − .01, p &amp;lt; .001 for all four courses1). Figure 3 visualizes how older certificate earners cover more of the learning content, with a 10% difference in coverage between the under-20 and the over-50-year-old groups. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coverage (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 4 also shows that a student’s country of origin has a statistically significant effect on their coverage. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certificate-earning students viewed, on average, 67% of the learning sequences in 3.091x, 77% in PH207x, 81% in CS188.1x, and 86% in 6.00x. Thus, students ignore, on average, 22% of the materials in those courses, yet still earn certificates. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 5 shows that certificateearning students from countries with higher student-teacher ratios usually visit fewer learning sequences. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course Navigation Strategy (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that all certificate earners had a common intent – to earn a passing grade – we wanted to understand how they went about doing so, and whether navigation strategies differed by demographic. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;support?&lt;br /&gt;
 The first part of the sentence needs to be warranted. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on backjumps because the ability to go “back in time” to view prior lectures or to re-try old assessments is one key differentiator of MOOCs over traditional residential courses with in-person lectures and exams. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certificate earners in our four courses performed an average of 1.04 backjumps for every learning sequence they visited (sd=0.62). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, students who did not earn certificates performed only 0.3 backjumps per visited sequence (sd=0.4). Thus, certificate earners repeat visiting prior sequences three times as often, presumably to review older content. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinds of backjumps (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each backjump can start and end at either an assessment (i.e., problem set or exam) or a lecture. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students most frequently backjump from an assessment to a lecture, which shows that they might be opportunistically looking up specific information needed to answer assessment questions. The second most prevalent kind of backjump is between two lectures, potentially when students are re-watching old lectures for more in-depth learning. Such lecture-to-lecture backjumps occur significantly less frequently (30% of total backjumps averaged across four courses) than assessment-tolecture backjumps (54% across four courses) (independent ttest, T4.6 = 5.2, p &amp;lt; .01). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student’s country of origin has a significant effect on the proportion of backjumps for three of the courses (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;student-teacher ratio had a negative correlation with backjumps, even controlling for other demographics and grades (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demographics and backjumps (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older certificate-earning students backjump more frequently. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;researchers have previously called “explorers” [17] in that they do not necessarily follow a given path. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital textbook usage (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results in the prior sub-section indicate that older students and those from countries with a low student-teacher ratio perform more backjumps. One possible explanation is that this behavior is emblematic of more independent learning and their preferences for non-linear navigation. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend is further supported by differences in the number of textbook events between demographic subgroups. Textbooks events are another type of non-linear navigation, since the digital textbook for each course is located outside of the main flow of the course materials. Again, a multiple regression analysis showed that older certificate earners access the textbook more frequently (b = .00003 − .0001, p &amp;lt; .001 for all courses). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION AND DESIGN IMPLICATIONS (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that most students navigate through the learning content in a non-linear way. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central limitation of this study is that by just analyzing log data, we cannot directly measure students’ true motivations, engagement, intent for enrolling in a MOOC, or their knowledge gained after passing the course. Coverage of learning sequences, as well as data on their certificates and grades, therefore served as proxies in our analyses. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gutiérrez, K. D., &amp;amp; Penuel, W. R. (2014). Relevance to Practice as a Criterion for Rigor. Educational Researcher , 43(1), 19–23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors argue for a reconceptualization of rigor that requires sustained, direct, and systematic documentation of what takes place inside programs to document how students and teachers change and adapt interventions in interactions with each other in relation to their dynamic local contexts. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They close by describing how this new criterion—“relevance to practice”—can ensure the longevity and efficacy of educational research. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Education Sciences Reform Act in 2002, it called for scientifically based research that would “apply rigor- ous, systematic, and objective methodology to obtain reliable and valid knowledge relevant to education activities and programs” (Pub. L. No. 107-279, p. 116). That same year, the National Research Council (2002) produced a report and Educational Researcher published a related article, “Scientific Culture and Education Research” (Feuer, Towne, &amp;amp; Shavelson, 2002), writ- ten by several of the report’s authors. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, conse- quential research on meaningful and equitable educational change requires a focus on persistent problems of practice, exam- ined in their context of development, with attention to ecologi- cal resources and constraints, including why, how, and under what conditions programs and policies work. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there was and still remains a concern from the field about the narrow set of criteria used to define rigor. Erickson and Gutiérrez (2002) questioned the publications’ call for a “scientific culture” that prescribed and relied primarily on “gold standard” random assignment studies of program effects as the remedy for the failures of education research to offer credible guidance for policy and practice. As we (Erickson &amp;amp; Gutiérrez, 2002) argued then, rigor in studies that aim to draw causal inferences about policies, programs, and prac- tices requires in-depth qualitative research. In particular, scien- tifically rigorous research on what works in education requires sustained, direct, and systematic documentation of what takes place inside programs to document not only “what happens” (cf. National Research Council, 2002) but also how students and teachers change and adapt interventions in interactions with each other in relation to their dynamic local contexts. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a study’s relevance to transforming practice (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As director John Easton (2013) recently noted, through these and other initiatives, IES is “promoting research use, but not in a unidirectional ‘research to practice’ sense but in a more reciprocal ‘practice to research’ pathway” (Easton, 2013, p. 18). This new research program calls for “empirical tinkering” (Morris &amp;amp; Hiebert, 2011) in which partners collaborate “to fine tune programs, interventions or regimens of activities through iterative processes that rely heavily on measurement, quick stud- ies and refinement” (Easton, 2013, p. 18). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these new programs to be successful, relevance to practice must be an explicit criterion for judging the quality of research proposals. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational systems have multiple layers of infrastructure that have accumulated over time and that must be engaged directly if they are to support, rather than obstruct, transformation (Penuel &amp;amp; Spillane, in press). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interventions themselves are contested spaces, filled with tensions and resis- tance from a range of stakeholders. Supporting and engaging more diverse stakeholder engagement in defining the focus of research and development will require researchers and reviewers to rethink the nature of educational interventions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dialectic of “resistance and accommoda- tion” in practice is what Pickering terms “the mangle of practice” (Pickering, 2010, p. 10). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These models do not require researchers to specify ahead of time all the elements of an intervention, since practitioners par- ticipate in design, and implementation data inform an iterative design process that often transforms interventions. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teachers discontinued use of the materials because of perceived policy pressures from within their school or district to adopt different materials and approaches to teaching mathematics. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly relevant dilemma for education research- ers who rely on extramural funding to support their empirical work. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we understand that review panels need criteria to ensure rigorous, systematic examination of an educational problem with a prob- ability of success in its execution. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our view, sustaining nearly any robust intervention will require ongoing work, work of the kind that went into making the SimCalc study a success and the program a good temporary fit to the goals of teachers for their students in the study. This includes work to craft profes- sional development, curriculum, and technology into a coherent “curricular activity system” that could be used in a wide variety of classrooms, work to align this system to standards, and work to support implementation of the system in the field (Roschelle, Knudsen, &amp;amp; Hegedus, 2010). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of mutual adjustment of powerful interventions and local contexts does not end when the research ends, but sus- taining an intervention requires uptake by schools and districts (Coburn, 2003). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, this represents an important advance for the agency, because greater weight is given to the importance of generalization from research findings. The challenges to generalization in education research are many (Berliner, 2002); here we highlight two challenges that strike us as particularly challenging for IES, given the kinds of projects the agency has funded in the past. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires a shift in focus of research and development efforts, away from innovations designed to be implemented with fidelity in a single context and toward cross-setting interventions that leverage diversity (rather than viewing it as a deficit). It also suggests the need to focus some research and development projects on the design of new organizational routines and infrastructures for improvement (Bryk et al., 2011; Penuel &amp;amp; Spillane, in press). It also implies the need for efficacy and effectiveness research that addresses how to make programs work under a wide range of cir- cumstances and for all groups (Bryk, 2009; Bryk et al., 2011). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT. The study focused on analysing the emergence of a progressive-inquiry culture in two CSILE (Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environment) classrooms across a three-year period. A principal feature of this kind of culture is the processing of explanatory knowledge instead of merely factual knowledge. The results of the study indicate that the classroom culture changed over the three years following the introduction of CSILE. The explanatory level of knowledge produced by the students became increasingly deeper in tracking from the first to third year. In one of the classrooms, the children’s levels of explanation reached substantial depth as we pass from year 1 to year 3; here the difference on this temporal variable was large and significant. In this classroom, the students’ inquiry was more and more explicitly focused on construction of their own intuitive explanations, as well as the search for explanatory scientific information. Progress in inquiry culture emerged only through the teacher’s extended efforts to expand students’ practices of progressive inquiry. (p. 199)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem addressed in the study was whether primary school children, collaborating within a computer-supported classroom, can profitably come to participate in a research-like processes of inquiry (i.e. approach the problems being investigated according to deepening levels of explanation rather that being bound with surface phenomena and processing merely factual information). (p. 199)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system provides students with a shared space for building, sharing and discussing of their ideas, whether in written or visual form. (p. 199)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the sustained process of advancing and building knowledge is called progressive inquiry (Hakkarainen, 1998; Hakkarainen &amp;amp; Sintonen, 2002). (p. 200)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there is evidence that participation in an extended process of shared inquiry fosters children’s ability to ask complex questions (Brown &amp;amp; Campione, 1996). (p. 200)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of inquiry and a critical condition of developing conceptual understanding is generation of explanations and theories for the phenomena being investigated (Bruner, 1996; Carey &amp;amp; Smith, 1995; Dunbar &amp;amp; Klahr, 1988; Perkins et al., 1995; Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 1993; Schwartz, 1995). The process of explanation increases understanding by pushing an agent to explicate the consequences of his or her view; it provides new information needed for answering an agent’s why and how questions and achieving his or her cognitive goals. (p. 200)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet students’ own explanations, hypotheses or conjectures do not have a significant role in current educational practices. Through explanation-driven learning, both intuitive and scientific ideas can be made the focus of inquiry (Bereiter, 2002; Scardamalia, 1999). (p. 200)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research evidence indicates that computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is one of the most promising innovations for increasing the quality of education with the help of modern information and communication technologies (Lehtinen, Hakkarainen, Lipponen, Rahikainen &amp;amp; Muukkonen, 1998; Pea et al., 1999; Roschelle &amp;amp; Pea, 1999). This pedagogical approach emphasises the importance of engaging students and teachers in coordinated efforts to build new knowledge and to solve problems together (Dillenbourg, Baker, Blaye &amp;amp; O’Malley, 1996). (p. 201)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose that the agent of progressive inquiry is not an individual, but a knowledge-building community (Bereiter, 2002; Paavola et al., 2002; Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 1999). This kind of community does not usually emerge spontaneously; it needs to be deliberately cultivated. (p. 201)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to the successful implementation of a knowledge-building community appears to be the building of a supporting social infrastructure around the technical infrastructure (Bielaczyc, 2001). Rather than focusing on only the collaborative technology, one has to address the social contexts critical for supporting meaningful implementation and use of technology. (p. 201)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of teacher and tech&lt;br /&gt;
 important comment on the social infrastructure (p. 201)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was based on our position that research on computer-supported collaborative learning cannot be grounded on qualitative discussion of “a few engaging anecdotes or particularly exciting transcripts” (Brown, 1992, p. 173), but systematic study of the epistemological and cognitive nature of inquiries across all participants and a representative selection of situations. (p. 202)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;METHOD (p. 202)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subjects were all of the students in two CSILE classes. During the three-year period analysed, 145 students in total worked with CSILE in one of the groups. (p. 202)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two teachers, whom we shall call Teacher A and Teacher B, corresponding to the two classrooms. (p. 203)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Study Material: The CSILE Database (p. 203)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their written productions from CSILE’s database were analysed through qualitative content analysis (Chi, 1997). For qualitative classification, in order to make a reliable classification of the material possible, CSILE students’ notes were first partitioned into ideas (regarding segmentation of data for content analysis; see Chi, 1997). (p. 204)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epistemological nature of the students’ research questions was analysed by classifying each research question according to whether it was factor explanation-seeking in nature. Why and how questions are typical explanation-seeking questions and cannot be satisfactorily answered without elaborating an explanation. Who, where, when, how many, and some what questions represented fact-seeking questions that can be answered by providing factual information concerning, for example, persons, things, places, times or numbers. (p. 204)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mean level of explanation was analysed across students’ productions representing their intuitive conceptions and scientific information sought by them. Each content idea constructed by the students to answer their research questions was classified using a five-step scale starting from (1) separated pieces of facts to (5) explanation (p. 205)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to analyse a CSILE student’s relation to his or her productions, I analysed whether he or she expressed personal ownership or involvement of their content ideas by using a variable called personalised epistemology. (p. 207)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Level of Explanation Scale (p. 207)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. Explanatory Level of Knowledge Processed Across a ThreeYear Period (p. 208)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A direct discriminant analysis was performed using three variables representing the nature of CSILE students’ knowledge production in biology as predictors of membership in a CSILE group. The predictors were the mean proportion of student-generated explanation-seeking research questions, the mean level of explanation of knowledge produced in biology, and the mean proportion of personalised epistemology. A composite variable of Year and CSILE group (Classroom A, year 1 [A1]; Classroom A, year 2 [A2]; Classroom A, year 3 [A3]; Classroom B, year 1 [B1]; Classroom B, year 2 [B2]; Classroom B, year 3 [B3]) was used as a grouping variable. Three discriminant functions were calculated, with a combined χ2(15) = 207.3, p &amp;lt; 0.000). (p. 209)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Classroom B’s biological study projects focused on factual information and, correspondingly, lower-level fact-seeking questions, across the whole period analysed. In accordance with the focus on explanatory knowledge, inquiry in Classroom A was driven by explanation-seeking questions. (p. 210)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One predictor, namely, the proportion of personalised epistemology, had a loading of 0.79 on the second discriminant function, which partially separates the Classroom A students in year 3 from the two earlier years of the classroom, indicating that the proportion of personalised epistemology in year 3 (M = 0.70) increased substantially from that of year 1 (M = 0.10) and year 2 (M = 0.25); the mean proportion of personalised epistemology did not change in Classroom B, remaining at the 0.10 level during each year examined. (p. 210)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that practices of knowledge production differed substantially between Classrooms A and B. Further, practices of knowledge processing in Classroom A progressively developed from one year to another, as an explanation-oriented process of inquiry had a more and more prominent role. The epistemological nature of knowledge processed by Classroom B, in contrast, did not substantially change; the group focused on processing factual knowledge across the whole period. (p. 211)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. CSILE Experience and Level of Explanation (p. 212)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to analyse the effects of CSILE experience in the context of individual students, the present analysis focused on examining how knowledge was processed by a small group of CSILE students who stayed two years in the classes, and so developed from their first and to their second year of CSILE study. (p. 212)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted in order to analyse differences in the level of explanation between the groups as a function of CSILE experience. The between-subject factor was Group (Ato-A; B-to-B; A-to-B; and B-to-A) and the within-subject factor CSILE experience (one year; two years). The dependent variable was mean level of explanation in biology. (p. 212)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also an interaction effect for Group by CSILE Experience indicating that the effect of CSILE experience was different in each group (F[3, 19] = 12.24, p &amp;lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.66) (see Figure 2). (p. 213)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, the analysis revealed that the mean level of explanation increased as a function of the experience of studying in Classroom A. Simultaneously, however, CSILE students’ culture of inquiry was also changing. In order to analyse relations between individual students’ inquiry and the evolution of CSILE culture as a whole, mean levels of explanation of the students’ inquiry who studied over the two-year period were plotted over the 95% confidence intervals for mean level of explanation in the CSILE groups as a whole (see Figure 3). (p. 213)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that an individual student’s epistemic practices and his or her classroom’s culture of inquiry were reciprocally dependent and co-evolved together. (p. 214)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3. Cultivating Progressive Inquiry Culture Within Classroom A (p. 214)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand Classroom A students’ extraordinary educational achievements, the present investigator interviewed Teacher A. (p. 214)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reported that he had participated in CSILE project from the very beginning and benefited substantially from a close collaboration with researchers (p. 214)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across years, he had perfected a special method of cultivating knowledge-building culture in his class. He reported that an important condition for creating an innovative knowledge building community was that he had a split class of Grade 5 and 6 students: (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would take those 8–10 students to the next year, and they were peer tutors, first, in how the system actually worked but, more importantly, in how the inquiry should go (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher stated that, just like any other teacher, he did not have too much time to read students contributions or to produce his own CSILE notes. In order to solve these constraints, he created a practice that guided the students to interact orally with him and to show what they were doing whenever they wanted to ‘publish’ a note in CSILE (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kb discourse (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had to make a contribution to a database, a significant contribution to a database. There had to be some evidence of thinking or knowledge building in the note. Now, in practice of course, you make allowances for different levels of ability of the student. (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;community knowledge (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Teacher A’s estimation, these kinds of oral knowledge-building discussions took twice as much time as actual working with CSILE. (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of teacher&lt;br /&gt;
 role of teacher and role of tech. Important note that oral discussions happen twice as much. (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns was to encourage students to build on earlier knowledge-building efforts: (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student came to me with four or five theories. I might start off by saying: “What do you think about theories that have gone before. How is yours different from those that have gone before.” A student might respond: “I do not know.” So I could say: “Maybe you could look at them, read them through and see if you agree or whether you [disagree].” (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher of Classroom A described how problems had a more and more important role in his classroom (p. 215)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As classroom processes evolved over time, it became clear to me that you could not have a regular classroom and then, for that 40 minutes, say that “we are going to do some knowledge building”. That was not going to work. So I had to use knowledge-building principles in everything that I did&amp;hellip; . (p. 216)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pervasive knowledge building (p. 216)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within these conditions, the iterative approach of working repeatedly with the same grade level appeared to facilitate progressive changes in pedagogical practices. (p. 216)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DISCUSSION (p. 216)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two CSILE classrooms, the epistemological nature of knowledge processes changed over three years following the introduction of CSILE. In terms of the level of explanation scale, explanations made over a year by the children in their CSILE notes became deeper in tracking from year 1 to year 3. In one of the classrooms, the children’s levels of explanation reached substantial depth as one passes from year 1 to year 3 (p. 216)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that the inquiry of the students in Classroom A was more and more explicitly focused on construction of their own intuitive explanations, as well as searching for explanatory scientific information. (p. 216)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, results of the study revealed that Classroom A students were engaged in a systematic generation of their own explanation-seeking re- (p. 216)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a significant educational achievement. CSILE studies carried out in Finland revealed that only 10% to 20% of research questions spontaneously generated by primary school students were explanation-seeking in nature (Hakkarainen et al., 2002). Although the students in Classroom B produced a significant proportion of explanation-seeking research questions, the scientific information processed by the group was at a substantially lower explanatory level than that of Classroom A. (p. 217)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An examination of the results indicates that the epistemological nature of learning tasks undertaken strongly influenced the nature of students’ process of inquiry. It was characteristic of Classroom A to conduct conceptually-challenging study projects that focused on gaining theoretical understanding of the problems being investigated, whereas Classroom B’s study projects focused on acquiring factual knowledge and empirical generalisations that usually did not go beyond everyday phenomena. (p. 217)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the analysis indicated that knowledge production in Classrooms A and B was not affected by the ability level or gender of the participating students. Evidence for a significant educational achievement was that, regardless of gender or ability level, Classroom A students were able to generate explanation-seeking questions, construct intuitive explanations and introduce explanatory scientific information. (p. 217)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because most of the children stayed in the class for one year only, the main candidates to whom both the significant effects can be attributed are the two teachers (A and B), who were the only persisting elements from year 1 to year 3. (p. 218)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher B, in contrast, appears neither to be equally involved with CSILE projects nor to be engaged in similar efforts of surpassing himself. He did not draw much on research assistance and hence his classroom process reflected his usual approach to instruction, with the CSILE software simply added in. (p. 218)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appeared to be an instance of expansive learning (Engeström, 1987) in which the teacher, with support, reflected on practices of his classroom culture, identified weaknesses and tensions of prevailing practices, and searched for novel opportunities to be pursued in the subsequent year. Creation of a culture of authentic inquiry at the primary level is extremely hard. The present investigation indicates that the current and very advanced practices emerged within Classroom A as a result of deliberate cultural transformation across several years. As pointed out by Feldman, Konold, and Coulter (2000), educational researchers tend to underestimate how much systematic effort and time it takes to transform educational practices. (p. 218)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This position piece articulates how writing is perceived and supported in knowledge building. It presents a thorough discussion of &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; understanding in writing, gaps in writing instruction, and the role Knowledge Building plays in writing (and roles writing plays in knowledge building). It also presents three examples of writing in knowledge building communities, in which roles of teachers and technology are explored. It summarizes some principles for teaching and support writing in knowledge building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing technologization of our society or perhaps, indeed, because of it literacy continues to be one of the principal goals of education. Yet the way in which the goal of literacy development is interpreted in classroom practice too easily becomes reduced to the mastering of ‘basic skills’, as students engage in routine exercises in reading and writing, drawn from textbooks that they have no part in choosing. However, ‘full literacy’ the disposition to engage appropriately with texts of different types in order to empower action, thinking, and feeling in the context of purposeful social activity (Wells, 1990) will never be achieved until students’ interests and purposes become the driving force for the literacy curriculum. This is even more true for students discovering how writing can be an occasion for learning. In this position paper, therefore, we focus on some of the roles that writing can play in developing literacy and learning when it takes place within classroom knowledge building communities. To illustrate our argument, we draw on examples from the classrooms of teacher researcher colleagues. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;models of the writing process proposed and further elaborated by such scholars as Flower &amp;amp; Hayes (1981), de Beaugrande (1984), and Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987). However, with the exception of the latter, this research did not have much connection with classrooms and was premised very largely on a conception of writing as a cognitive-linguistic activity carried out by individuals in isolation from a discourse community of other readers and writers.1 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear feature of these classroom studies, connecting them to much writing undertaken outside educational contexts, is the primary concern with meaning and purposeful communication. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these various kinds of research, both cognitive and social, a number of conclusions can be drawn: • The process of becoming literate is inherently social in nature, even though it is individuals who read and write. Literacy events do not take place in isolation, but in relation to a discourse community of which the reader or writer is, or wishes to become, a member. • Writing is first and foremost concerned with developing a structure of meaning; the specification of what one wants to say becomes clearer and more complete in the actual writing and revising of the text for a particular purpose and audience. • It follows, therefore, that the literate practices and values that individuals develop depend on the purposes for reading and writing that they encounter in home, school and (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;community activities; where these differ, or even more when they are in conflict, the process of becoming literate is rendered increasingly difficult. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing Approaches to Writing in the Classroom (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There certainly have been significant changes, in the last twenty-five years, in the way in which the learning and teaching of writing is approached in the English-speaking world. Emig’s (1971) seminal work on the composing processes of twelfth graders opened a new door for writing researchers. In place of traditional product analysis, they began to explore what goes on in individual writers’ heads while composing. (e.g., Flower &amp;amp; Hayes, 1981, 1984; Bereiter &amp;amp; Scardamalia, 1987), and this, in turn, led to a shift in perspective from a view of writing as a linear process to a recognition of its recursive nature, involving pre-planning and revising as ongoing component activities. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theoretical emphasis on process-oriented writing instruction has, in general, brought about positive changes in teaching practice. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ne of the criticisms has been that, despite the theoretical recognition of writing as a recursive process, it is still the case that, in many classrooms, writing continues to be presented as a linear sequence of planning, pre-writing, writing, revising and publishing. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second criticism has emerged from the focus on the social purposes of writing. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, decisions about how to help students master the ‘technology’ of writing cannot usefully be taken on their own for, as with reading and talking, what students learn about writing will depend upon what they use writing to do. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning and Knowledge Building (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of our approach to learning through inquiry is the notion of ‘the spiral of knowing’ (figure 1), which posits understanding as the goal of learning. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All learning starts from personal experience, as one is currently able to understand it; to this is added information, whether sought out, deliberately provided by others, or picked up incidentally. However, new information does not automatically lead to enhanced understanding; for this to occur, the information needs to be articulated with what is already understood, often involving a degree of transformation in the process. This is achieved through knowledge building, sometimes undertaken solo in ‘inner speech’, but more often in dialogue with others. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, knowledge building is the process through which, by purposefully knowing together, we increase both our individual and our common understanding (Wells, 1999). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing as a Tool for Knowledge Building (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this framework, as it applies in the classroom, writing has a dual role. The process of composing a written text is always potentially an occasion of knowledge building, as the writer attempts to communicate what he or she understands about a topic or situation to an audience of others or to the writer on a future occasion. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as a means of mediating the enhancement of understanding, writing is most powerful when the text already written, or in process of being written, is treated as an object with which the writer dialogues in the effort to improve it. For in transforming the text, one also to some degree transforms one’s own understanding. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opportunity for reciprocal transformation of self and text is the reason for treating writing as one of the most effective means of learning (Langer &amp;amp; Applebee, 1987). Generally, however, this benefit is conceived in terms of the solitary writer. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these latter circumstances, the text in production is indeed an improvable object, and one which engages the joint writers in spoken dialogue about aspects of its creation, ranging from their understanding of the topic, through the selection and organization of the information to include in the light of the intended audience, to the composition of successive sentences and paragraphs. In the process, too, linguistic choices of genre, register, syntax and vocabulary are also involved not to mention spelling and punctuation. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to give substance to these claims, in the following sections we will present some examples of writing functioning as a means of collaborative knowledge building, drawn from the action research carried out by members of DICEP in local schools. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinosaur Schools (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeds and Webs (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When children took home books to read with their parents, she asked the parents to write the children’s reflective comments on Post-it notes and to stick each note on the appropriate page. Then, when several children had read the same book, she planned to discuss the book with them and create a web in which their notes were spatially related in terms of ideas that were connected in some way. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be unusual for six-year-olds to be engaged, as they are here, in considering the relationship between the different themes of a story and providing justifications for their opinions. But what is particularly interesting about the procedure that the teacher has invented is that, by having the children’s comments on different aspects of the story written on small Post-it notes, their ideas do indeed become objects that can be compared, and physically placed in different relationships to each other. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the meta-cognitive talk. They are not used to making these thoughts explicit, and it is exactly this type of talk that moves the conversation beyond discussion of the literal into the more abstract themes of the story. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience of engaging in the use of seeds and webs to respond to literature helped us [the teachers] to grow as learners and to value the understanding that can be gained through literature. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we see the very first attempt in these two classroom communities to use a new genre of written text a web as a means of relating story themes and structures to the the story world and to personal experience. Not surprisingly, the teacher has to provide a considerable amount of supportive scaffolding. In the next example, by contrast, the students are sufficiently familiar with the tool they are using to manage without such teacher support. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;contrast, the students are sufficiently familiar with the tool they are using to manage without such teacher support. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building the Knowledge Wall (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, writing has been thought of as monologic and conversation as dialogic. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE) for exactly this purpose (Scardamalia, Bereiter, &amp;amp; Lamon, 1994) (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Karen Hume read an article describing CSILE and was intrigued by its possibilities for supporting the kind of inquiry-oriented work she promotes in her intermediate level classrooms.5 However, as her school did not have the necessary network of computers, she had to find an alternative, less costly, ’technology’. Her solution was both cheap and very effective. She cleared a large notice-board on one wall of her classroom to serve as the equivalent of the database and waited for an appropriate opportunity to launch her idea. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;technology&lt;br /&gt;
 role of technology empirical example of what to do without access to KF: a wall. this has been tested in many different cases (Idea First in Singapore). (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen saw her opportunity and asked the first student to write his observation and proposed explanation on a Post-it note and pin it to the notice-board. She then invited other students to add their comments and alternative explanations. Within minutes, the first notes were posted and, over the next two days, some 40 more were added to the board, some signed and some anonymous. Arguments for both positions a very large number of reflections, or none at all were initially almost equally forthcoming. However, those who believed there would be no reflections finally succeeded in persuading their opponents through the cogency of the arguments that they used to support their position. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the inauguration of the ‘Knowledge Wall’ and, since then, it has played a central role in many curricular units in Karen’s classroom. Typically, after some initial exploration of the topic, the class brainstorms the questions they think are most worth pursuing. These questions are then posted on the knowledge wall. Students select the questions they are most interested in researching and add their findings, theories and further questions to the knowledge wall as the principal means of pursuing their inquiries. From time to time, whole class discussions are held orally to make connections between the different issues being investigated and to reflect on their significance. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to argue that writing supersedes oral discussion. In all classrooms in which this sort of written discussion occurs, participants also talk with each other about notes already posted and those they are thinking of writing. However, something more is involved when the contribution is made in writing. Unlike speech, writing leaves a record of the activity involved an object that can be returned to at leisure, and then reconsidered and improved through revision or response (Lotman, 1988). (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oral and written&lt;br /&gt;
 why written is important. also corresponds to the importance of technology. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An equally important feature of writing in this mode is that it requires the writer to make the intended point explicit and relevant to the ongoing structure of the discussion. This need for responsivity is much less apparent when writing in essay form for the teacher; however, on the knowledge wall, it is clearly essential for the effectiveness of the contribution. The point about ‘progressive discourse’, as Bereiter emphasizes, is that this is not a solitary, but a collaborative, undertaking: as they write to, and for, each other, “understandings are being generated that are new to the local participants and that the participants recognize as superior to their previous understandings” (Bereiter, 1994, p.9). (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been established through further work on Vygotsky’s (1987) concept of the zone of proximal development, assistance can be provided in a variety of forms and by many kinds of ‘others’. What is essential is that the participants be involved in a joint activity and have goals that are compatible. Although the form of assistance that an ‘expert’ other can give is often beneficial in providing scaffolding that is tailored to the learner’s needs, there is also much to be gained from working with peers on a question to which no-one knows the answer in advance, and where each learns through collaborative knowledge building as they attempt to construct an answer or solution (Wells, 1999). (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have argued, one of the key characteristics of a knowledge building community is purposeful and thoughtful use of language, both spoken and written, as students actively engage in interactive/collaborative activities that involve what we, as well as Langer and Applebee (1987), have called “literate thinking”. Within such a community, writing is used as a tool for learning in many different ways, according to the interests and concerns of community members at particular moments in time. However, for it to serve as a means of building knowledge and increasing understanding, two principles seem to be paramount: • the text serves a purpose in the life of the community and will be responded to accordingly by others who share the authors’ interests; in this sense, the writing is part of an ongoing dialogue, the aim of which is for all concerned to achieve a richer understanding of what is at issue. • within this communicative context, writing is treated as being concerned primarily with discovering and developing meaning in dialogue with the emerging text; issues of structure and lexico-grammar are not neglected, but they are first considered in terms of their function in clarifying meaning and, together with spelling, only secondarily in relation to conventional correctness. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how writing is viewed in KB&lt;br /&gt;
 1) text serves a purpose; 2) being communicative comes the first. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two decades there has been much debate over the relative importance to be given to “process” and “product” in relation to the teaching of writing. However, when students are really interested in the topic they are exploring, and have a real purpose for their writing, this dichotomy ceases to be relevant. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about writing from the perspective outlined here makes it very clear that teachers have a number of important roles to play in helping students to develop as writers. First is the creating of settings and activities in which genuine purposes for writing may develop as well as audiences to whom the writing may be addressed. These features need to be planned so that students will be encouraged to extend their knowledge about the topics or subject matter under investigation and at the same time to appropriate and make their own those written genres that are likely to be required for academic success.8 Second is the provision of advice and instruction for example on register and genre choices offered when they will be most helpful (Atwell, 1987). And third is contingently responsive support to individual students at varying stages in the composition and revision of their texts (Haneda, 1999). (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teacher&amp;rsquo;s role in writing&lt;br /&gt;
 1) setup; 2) advice and instruction — when needed; 3) responsiveness. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we have drawn on the work of students and teachers involved in the Developing Inquiring Communities in Education Project to argue for the value of treating writing, not as an end in itself, but as a tool for knowledge building. In particular, we have drawn attention to the importance of agency the making of deliberate, functional choices as well as working in collaboration with others as criterial features of such communities. As we hope to have shown, when writing is used as a means of knowledge building, not only do students extend their repertoire of writing strategies but the effort they put into creating functionally effective texts plays a significant role in their learning and enhances the development of shared understanding among all those involved.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper we explore various interpretations of the term &amp;ldquo;distributed cognition,&amp;rdquo; then turn our attention to communities grounded in the practice of collaborative knowledge building. We discuss CSILE (Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environments), a technology designed to support contributions to a communal database. Shared responsibility for this community resource extends to aspects of school practice typically handled exclusively by teachers, and engagement in improving and connecting the contents of the database makes the process of knowledge building self-sustaining.

 Was this paper the first one to mention design principles? a precursor of principle-based design? (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;design principles for distributed knowledge building processes. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional notion that cognition resides &amp;ldquo;in the head&amp;rdquo; is currently being challenged by a perspective of cognition as distributed over both individuals and their surrounds. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lave (1988) for example, suggests that the relationship between human thought, human action, and the environment is so tightly interwoven that the mind cannot be studied independently of the culturally organized settings within which people function. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a decade our research has been exploring the implications of distributed cognition for schooling and educational practice. What kinds of distributions facilitate learning? And how can technologies be harnessed to support educationally effective distributed processes? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;distributed cognition&lt;br /&gt;
 Interesting that in this earlier paper distributed cognition is strongly emphasized, whereas self-organization and complex systems are mentioned more nowadays. Wondering how the transition happened and why? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHAT IS DISTRIBUTED COGNITION? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean to say that a group of people know something? And what does the word distributed mean? An investigation of the literature reveals many conflicting responses to these questions. For clarity, we examine the concept of distributed cognition from three perspectives: a situative perspective, a cognitive perspective, and a combined perspective. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed Cognition: A Situative Interpretation (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the situative perspective (Lave, 1988; Lave and Wenger, 1991) claim that much or all of what is learned is tied to the specific situation in which the learning takes place. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is not simply that in-the-head knowledge is selectively tailored to meet the particular needs of each situation, but that the affordances and constraints of a situation are an inseparable part of the cognitive process. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tight binding between in-the-head representations and in-the-world activity suggests that cognition should be viewed as distributed over mind, body, and the surrounds. The term &amp;ldquo;distributed,&amp;rdquo; in this case, does not mean &amp;ldquo;divided up&amp;rdquo; in the sense that candies are distributed to children at a party. Rather it means &amp;ldquo;spread over,&amp;rdquo; much in the same way that weather systems cover a geographical area. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion, the mind, the setting, activity, artifacts, signs, symbols, social processes, and cultural factors comprise a mutually interacting, interdependent, and indivisible system of cognition (Greeno, 1997). Thus, from a sociocultural point of view, individual mental processing is better understood as a complex system involving the individual and the whole personal environment. All cognition is fundamentally situated and distributed. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a complex system of mental processing&lt;br /&gt;
 ‘complex system’ is mentioned here. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important extension of the situative perspective is a line of thinking that focuses almost exclusively on social distributions. Grounded in Vygotskian theory, this approach suggests that knowledge exists in the way that social groups communicate, make use of symbols and tools, and organize their belief systems. Understanding is no longer a process of coming to know the entities and attributes that exist in the world, but one of successfully negotiating the meaning of these objects with others. This is achieved by taking a legitimate role in the ongoing activities of a community and gradually moving to fuller participation (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collins et al. (1989) have begun to investigate the educational ramifications of Vygotskian theory by devising an instructional model called cognitive apprenticeship. At the heart of cognitive apprenticeship is the notion of a &amp;ldquo;zone of proximal development&amp;rdquo; (Vygotsky, 1978)—a zone of cognitive processes that are just beyond the student&amp;rsquo;s immediate capabilities. The idea is that the teacher and student collaboratively work on activities in this zone, with the teacher gradually transferring responsibility for activities to the student as competence develops. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cog appreticeship&lt;br /&gt;
 It seems it will be contrasted with KB later in this paper. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed Cognition: A Cognitive Interpretation (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus is on the individual&amp;rsquo;s internal intellectual structures, with in-the-world activity serving as input to mental processes through the sensory-motor channels. This view is consistent with the situative position, that activity is an important part of learning, but in the cognitive case a strong distinction is made between &amp;ldquo;knowing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;doing&amp;rdquo; rather than viewing the two as completely interdependent and inseparable. Some knowledge is specific to in-the-world situations, while other knowledge is contextually independent (Anderson et al., 1996). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a strictly cognitive perspective, the notion of distributed cognition is ill-defined. If cognition is interpreted as an in-the-head phenomenon, then how can cognition be distributed across people or objects? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, a child can know X (that the Earth is round) and not-X (that everyone walks on the same seemingly horizontal plane) at the same time. Similarly, a researcher may adopt the pragmatic perspective that knowledge and learning are fundamentally situated for some purposes, and in-the-head for other purposes (Cobb, 1994). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;psychological underpinning&lt;br /&gt;
 distributed cognition serve as a psych underpinning of KB? or at least in its early stage? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discourse is dynamic; none of the participants know with absolute certainty where a particular thread will lead or what new ideas will emerge. This co-construction of a progression-of-thought is one interpretation of the phrase &amp;ldquo;distributed cognition&amp;rdquo; from a cognitive point of view. Each person&amp;rsquo;s individual cognitions are continually reorganized in an effort to construct meaning out of the other person&amp;rsquo;s speech acts. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion that there may be different kinds of distributed cognition has been suggested by Salomon (1993) who proposed that there are at least two classes. The first class consists of cognitions that are distributed through shared activity, such as the problem-solving conversation described above. The second class, called off-loading, is the one more commonly used to describe material distributions (although one also can off-load onto other humans). For example, a shopping list supports the cognitive task of remembering what groceries need to be purchased. A calculator helps with arithmetic operations. A folder placed by the door serves as a reminder to bring the folder to work. A car dashboard reduces some of the complexity of driving. And so on. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artifacts mediate cognition, but they do not do cognition (Pea, 1993), and it is not clear in what sense they contain knowledge (see Anderson et al., 1995, for further discussion of this last point). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed Cognition: A Combined Interpretation (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension that exists between the cognitive and situative interpretations is rooted in a disagreement concerning the nature of cognition. The former presupposes a container model (Bereiter and Scardamalia, 1996), in which the mind is viewed as a container for cognition. Situative theory, on the other hand, proposes that cognition emerges when people, objects, and situations combine. Cognition is spread over the entire situation, and it can not be reduced to chunks of cognition that are located in the head or in an object. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed intelligence focuses on situated, moment-by-moment interactions—what people do in their day-to-day lives. It involves planning, inventing artifacts, reorganizing existing artifacts to facilitate future personal and communal activity, and so forth (Pea, 1993). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Pea and Salomon propose theoretical frameworks that interweave individual cognitions with cognitions (or &amp;ldquo;intelligences&amp;rdquo; in Pea&amp;rsquo;s case) that are situationally-based and grounded in activity. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISTRIBUTED COGNITION AND EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the notion that students should take charge of the highest-level regulatory functions of the classroom—functions such as evaluation of progress in understanding, curriculum coverage, and so forth—are still considered the exclusive domain of teachers and curriculum experts. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;regulatory functions/processes&lt;br /&gt;
 interesting that in this earlier paper ‘regulatory functions/processes’ is used instead of ‘cognitive responsibility’. Distribution is emphasized (in addition to collective), and less used in later literature. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater distribution of regulatory processes—including those related to curriculum goals and assessment of progress—havebeen the concern of the CSILE (Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environments) initiative. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Knowledge-BuildingCommunityModel (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a broad sense, a Knowledge-Building Community is any group of individuals dedicated to sharing and advancing the knowledge of the collective. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is defining about a Knowledge-Building Community is not formal association (e.g., &amp;ldquo;Department,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Club,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Company&amp;rdquo;) or physical proximity (although that is often important) but a commitment among its members to invest their resources in the collective upgrading of knowledge. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extended to a classroom setting, the KnowledgeBuilding Community model is different from contemporary school practices in several respects: (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classroom Activity Defined by Advances in Knowledge Rather than Completion of Tasks (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional school tasks may still be involved, but these are now subordiante to engagement in a collaborative research program with the goal of advancing both individual and collective understanding. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like an academic research community, this involves talking to more knowledgeable colleagues, reading relevant resource materials, posing questions, offering theories, conducting experiments, and generally working with peers to make sense of new ideas. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater Access to Distributed Expertise (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a typical classroom of 20-30 students there is a wealth of untapped knowledge and expertise. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Knowledge-Building Community model attempts to solve this problem through technological supports. As networked computer systems make their way into school classrooms, they provide us with opportunities to redesign the kinds of distributions that go on there. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of technology&lt;br /&gt;
 an important point about the role of tech for KB — making distributed expertise easier to support (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;many-to-many&amp;rdquo; form of communication bypasses many of the logistical limitations associated with large group, face-to-face discourse, providing opportunities for distributed processes that would normally not be possible. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but&lt;br /&gt;
 it also brings about a challenge to make sense of, regulate, and advance such a many-to-many discourse. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student-Created Artifacts as Mediators of Distributed Cognition (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the initiating, or designing, end of distributed cognition. The culture of schools, however, is one that de-emphasizes this design process (Pea, 1993). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, they are not likely to be referred to again. Thus, while students go through the motions of creating new artifacts, they fail to reap the benefits of using them as cognitive tools. Rather than &amp;ldquo;teaching for the design of distributed intelligence,&amp;rdquo; as Pea (1993) recommends, schools set up artificial situations that fail to convey the personal and communal advantages of actively distributing knowledge (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this deficiency, student-created artifacts in a Knowledge-Building Community are made available to the entire class. Using a collaborative online environment, each student&amp;rsquo;s ideas are stored as electronic documents in a publicly-accessible database, and can be subsequently used as a foundation for other, more advanced artifacts. In this manner, student work is valued as an intellectual resource for the entire classroom community. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resnick (1991) points out that many efficient systems in nature are of a form in which none of the individual parts manages the activity of the whole. He suggests that people tend to bring a &amp;ldquo;centralized mindset&amp;rdquo; to problems of organization and task completion, and overlook the possibility of building more autonomous, self-organizing systems. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;self-organizing systems&lt;br /&gt;
 mentioned… (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE: Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE (Scardamalia et al., 1989) (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 presents a typical discussion window, with a student&amp;rsquo;s problem represented at the top of the window, and classmate responses recorded in chronological order below. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;problem-centered&lt;br /&gt;
 tech design of CSILE is quite different from KF nowadays. moving from problem-based to the problem field rarely used. What happened?&lt;br /&gt;
 looks much like threaded discussion around a single problem.&lt;br /&gt;
 not clear how links among different notes are drawn. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Database browsing occurs through a &amp;ldquo;Knowledge Map&amp;rdquo; utility which provides a graphical overview of the notes written in a database topic (Fig. 2). Rectangles on the Knowledge Map represent discussions, squares represent graphics, and circles represent text notes. Different colored lines represent different types of connectivity between notes. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESIGNS FOR SUPPORTING DISTRIBUTED PROCESSES (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, we have identified a number of general strategies that seem particularly effective in fostering educationally-beneficial distributed practices. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support Educationally Effective Peer Interactions (p. 12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One goal, therefore, is to develop a framework of social support in the classroom that optimizes the conditions necessary for educationally effective peer relations. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;computer-supported discourse gives all students a voice, and provides time for reflection and revision before an idea is submitted for public scrutiny (Harasim, 1990). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While online discourse may promote equality, it is arguably less conducive to maintaining an optimal level of conflict. Sometimes it produces too little. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Grounding a conversation&amp;rdquo; (Clark and Schaefer, 1989; Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986) is a difficult task across media that lack copresence, visibility, audibility,and simultaneity(Clark and Brennan, 1991). Users of such environments need to invest more effort in formulating their contributions than they would otherwise. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teacher&amp;rsquo;s role?&lt;br /&gt;
 grounding educationally meaningful peer interactions? (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE teachers often discuss collaboration strategies with their class. They encourage students to read and comment upon other people&amp;rsquo;s work. And they illustrate effective and ineffective ways of disagreeing and criticizing. For instance, teachers might write sample sentence starters on the blackboard (e.g., &amp;ldquo;I really like your idea, but I wonder if &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;). Students copy these down in their notebooks, and then refer to them during their CSILE sessions. The goal, of course, is not to avoid student disagreement or argumentation but to maintain a balance between too much and too little conflict. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate Different Forms of Discourse (p. 13)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE teachers try to be sensitive to the different strengths of faceto-face conversation and online discourse, and look for effective ways of combining the two in the classroom. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teacher&amp;rsquo;s role (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or instance, they may encourage groups of students to gather together around a common computer and coconstruct notes. Or, they orchestrate classroom activities so that in-person conversations are more likely to make their way into the database, (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, their conversations &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; into the database &amp;hellip; ; otherwise it would be lost/shared in a sense to just the few rather than the community of learners. (Cedar Rapids Iowa, U.S.) (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also role of technology (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus Students on Communal Problems of Understanding (p. 14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to come to a shared understanding places greater demands on students to clarify ideas, refine theories, answer each other&amp;rsquo;s questions, and negotiate meaning with one another. One of the ways that the CSILE interface provides affordances for problem-centered discourse is through its discussion facility (Figs. 1, 3). Any class member may start a discussion by recording a personal problem of understanding in the &amp;ldquo;problem area&amp;rdquo; of the note. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;embodied design&lt;br /&gt;
 principle embodied in tech design. in this case, problem-based learning. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion environment also contains a special branching feature that allows students to create subdiscussions as they develop more specific queries (Fig. 4). Miyake (1986) noticed in a study of people trying to understand the functioning of a sewing machine that participants learned in an iterative fashion. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions inspire new explanations, and explanations, in turn, inspire more questions. The resultant cascade of discussions is visible to students on the Knowledge Map as a web of interrelated notes. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some teachers report that it is sometimes difficult to keep students focused on making advances on their (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;communal problems. Many students find it easier to study broad topic areas than to find answers to specific problems. As one CSILE teacher explains: (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do spend quite a bit of time with individualsasking them what problem they&amp;rsquo;re working on when they&amp;rsquo;re doing their research. The answer often is, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m working on energy&amp;rdquo; (for example), so I take that opportunity to redirect them to a problem which they are trying to solve. I explain to them how difficult it is to find information related to a specific problem and how they will have to consult many sources before they are likely to be successful. It&amp;rsquo;s another attempt to move them away from the model of source material determining the direction of research, rather than the problem determining the direction of research. (Teacher, Toronto Ontario) (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of teacher&lt;br /&gt;
 focusing students on problems. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the teaching task is not simply one of supporting distributed processes, but is also a matter of focusing distributions in the direction of sustained collaborative inquiry by relating individual activity to pressing communal problems. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote Awareness of Participants&amp;rsquo; Contributions (p. 16)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an attitude that CSILE teachers continually try to change by highlighting interesting student work and encouraging database exploration. For students to take advantage of their classmates&amp;rsquo; knowledge productions they have to know that those resources exist. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teacher&amp;rsquo;s role (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several facilities have been constructed to promote awareness and exploration of CSILE notes. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage Students to Build on Each Other&amp;rsquo;s Work (p. 18)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teacher&amp;rsquo;s role (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE teachers place a great emphasis on making connections with other students. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers, for their part, encourage students to take up each other&amp;rsquo;s ideas, conjectures, and queries, and extend them through online discourse. Their goal is not simply to encourage collaboration and the efficient distribution of resources, but also for students to view their ideas as useful communal artifacts. This is consistent with the notion that students come to appreciate the personal and social advantages of designing distributed intelligence into their environment (Pea, 1993). (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasize the Work of the Community (p. 18)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;more successful CSILE teachers have adopted the strategy of focusing students on advancing the class&amp;rsquo;s knowledge. The reason for this is twofold. First, by placing the individual&amp;rsquo;s work in the context of a larger group mission, the teacher illustrates that the learner&amp;rsquo;s own writings have value that extends beyond assessment. Second, by trying to make advances on what the group knows collectively, the student must first learn what the group already knows—and that process leads to a deeper understanding of the content and deeper appreciation of peer contributions. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXTENDING KNOWLEDGE-BUILDING COMMUNITIES (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our objective in identifying design principles is to clarify means for engaging students in processes of knowledge advancement. This requires a significant reconceptualization of classroom operations. It is not enough to carry out just one or two of the above approaches—rather, it requires the coming together of many new practices. Such dramatic changes can be difficult to make. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;implementation of principles&lt;br /&gt;
 interesting comment that this is hard to achieve at once. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most novice CSILE users have entrenched preconceptions that interfere with the goal of establishing a classroom-based Knowledge-Building Community. The challenge, therefore, is not simply to provide opportunities for distributed processes, because students may not even recognize them as such. Instead, the challenge is to design situations and tools that have a deliberate bias toward shared activity and rewarding interactions with other knowledge builders. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;community of practice&lt;br /&gt;
 interesting that it has been used in earlier KB literature to describe KB communities. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE research is an ongoing process of finding new ways to enculturate students into a knowledge-centered community of practice. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Knowledge-Building Community idea is being tested both in the classroom and in the online community of CSILE teachers. In both cases, the goal is to make the drive for improvement become self-sustaining, (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To foster a classroom-based Knowledge-Building Community, we suggest that a careful interweaving of computer supports and new educational (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;practices can bring about a more effective use of distributed resources in the classroom. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

Becker (Eds.), Innovative assessment for the 21st century (pp. 107–138). Springer. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1007&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;978&lt;/sub&gt;-1-4419-6530-1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.1 New Media the Technology Proficiencies and Schools (p. 109)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent studies reveal the tremendous levels of “hanging out, messing around, and geeking out” in friendship-driven and interest-driven social networks (Ito, 2008). This has highlighted the awkward relationship between these communities and schools. (p. 109)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.1.1 Why Bother? (p. 109)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widening participation gap in new media is a concern (p. 109)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put differently, this gap blocks opportunities for learning “the new embodiments of ‘being literate’ in contemporary culture” (Steinkuehler, Black, &amp;amp; Clinton, 2005). (p. 110)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.2 Efforts to Bridge the Void Between New Proficiencies and Schools (p. 110)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gee defines being literate as having control of what he calls secondary Discourses. Where primary Discourses are ways of using language learned in one’s home and community, secondary Discourses are associated with “secondary institutions,” such as schools. By defining literacy as control of secondary Discourses, Gee (1989, p. 542) suggests that “when one is learning to read and to write, one is actually learning ways of reading and writing that connect up with the values, purposes, and worldviews of the secondary Discourse wherein the learning is occurring (and, consequentially, which exist in relation to the learner’s primary Discourse—for better or worse).” (p. 111)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.2.1.3 New Approaches to Writing (p. 112)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NCTE report Writing in the Twenty-First Century (Yancey, 2009) points out that new media means “composers become composers not through direct and formal instruction alone (if at all), but rather through what we might call an extracurricular social co-apprenticeship” (p. 5). Thus, “our impulse to write is now digitized and expanded—or put differently, newly technologized, socialized, and networked” (2009, p. 5). (p. 112)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Writing Project’s Teaching the New Writing (Herrington, Hodgson, &amp;amp; Moran, 2009) examines how writing teachers across the nation are responding to new technologies. For example, in Teaching Writing Using Blogs, Wikis, and other Digital Tools, Beach, Anson, Breuch, and Swiss (2008) show how digital tools can transform schools to engage students in “meaningful multimodal literacy practices.” Hull and Nelson (2005) illustrated the potential for multimodal literacy in their ongoing work with Digital Underground Storytelling for Youth, an urban afterschool/summer program. They argued that multimodality increases the “multiplex ways by which people can make meaning in the world” and affords “a democratizing force” by incorporating the “views and values of more people than ever before” (p. 226). In Chicago, The Digital Youth Network shows the promise of a hybrid digital literacy program that brings inand out-of-school learning closer together by developing students’ new media literacies in an after-school learning environment so students can utilize them in school. (p. 113)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we argue that framing new proficiencies primarily as specific skills that can be measured in isolation from their contexts of use necessarily overlooks the most important aspects needed to foster them in schools (Greeno, 1997). Thus, we contend that these new proficiencies should primarily be framed as social practices, which are best understood by interpreting the ways they are used and learned in the social networks in which they emerge (or might emerge). We further contend that these proficiencies should be framed secondarily as individual conceptual understanding, as might be understood by assessing whether individuals can solve similar problems that require those proficiencies. We then argue that only once the proficiencies have been interpreted in their social context and then assessed as individual understanding should they be measured in the aggregate on any conceivable standardized external test. (p. 117)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, we believe that the next generation of achievement tests should be used “at a distance” to track and evaluate the success of curricula and policies in fostering broad attainment of these new proficiencies. Our argument is grounded in two primary aspects of validity theory. (p. 117)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.3.1 Evidential Validity (p. 117)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, we embrace the doubts of situativity theorists (e.g., Greeno &amp;amp; Gresalfi, 2008) about the validity of scores from any individual assessment of knowledge. But we choose to pragmatically sequester that concern, because we also agree that policy makers and program evaluators need measures that are aligned to common standards (and largely independent of particular curricular approaches) in order to provide valid evidence for documenting the impact of policies, tracking long-term improvement, conducting studies that generalize beyond the sample, etc. For better or worse, our efforts aim to bridge the tenuous void between these two positions. (p. 118)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.4 A Proposed Participatory Alternative (p. 120)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.4.3 Key Aspects and Assumptions of Participatory Assessment (p. 122)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participatory assessment treats all participants in the education process as potential “learners.” This includes students, teachers, designers, administrators, and policy makers. (p. 126)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach embraces Lemke’s (2000) suggestion that it is useful to analyze activity across three timescales, focusing on activity at a central timescale and aligning to those across adjacent timescales. (p. 126)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.5 Conclusion (p. 134)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this alternative approach is still in its infancy and raises far more problems than it solves. Because it is so solidly rooted in newer situative and participatory views of cognition and learning that have not been widely appreciated by the assessment and measurement community, we assume that some will find it quite dense and perhaps overly complicated. Conversely, because our approach acknowledges concerns over accountability that have been ignored or dismissed by the community associated with the practice-oriented responses, we anticipate puzzlement from some over our interest in improving performance on such measures. In response, we reiterate that this approach is a resolutely pragmatic one. We contend that most efforts to foster ethical, equitable, and transparent participation in new media and technology practices will eventually be forced to confront the tensions that we have explored in this chapter. (p. 134)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Hickey2011&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hickey, D. T., McWilliams, J., &amp;amp; Honeyford, M. A. (2011). Reading Moby-Dick in a Participatory Culture: Organizing Assessment for Engagement in a New Media Era. Journal of Educational Computing Research, 45(2), 247–263. doi:10.2190/EC.45.2.g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article identifies discrepancies between traditional instructional practices that emphasize individual mastery of abstract concepts and skills and new media literacy practices that rely upon collaborative, social, and context-specific activity. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework, which we call “participatory assessment,” builds on previous work in science and math instruction, as well as in immersive video games, and extends that work into the secondary English language arts classroom. This article describes the curriculum, the approach, and some of the assessment design principles that emerged. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers know that most students spend much of their free time “hanging out, messing around, and geeking out” in digital social networks (Ito, Baumer, Bittani, boyd, Cody, Herr-Stephenson, et al., 2009). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This volume and other publications (e.g., Coiro, Knobel Lankshear, &amp;amp; Leu, 2008; Greenhow, Robelia, &amp;amp; Hughes, 2009) summarize the many reasons for including new media practices such as social networking, social bookmarking, and blogging in schools, and teaching so-called “new media literacies” (Jenkins, Clinton, Purushotma, Robinson, &amp;amp; Weigel, 2009). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy transforms student assessment, an established school practice that otherwise presents one of the most daunting challenges. Building directly on the participatory nature of digital social networks (Brown &amp;amp; Adler, 2008; Jenkins et al., 2009), participatory assessment fosters authentic school-based engagement in new media literacies and practices while indirectly (but consistently) yielding improvement in more traditional literacies and practices. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we leverage the skills and mindsets young people are developing in their use of digital technologies in order to enhance their engagement with traditional texts? 2. Howcanweuseinnovativeassessmentpracticestodosogiventherealities of classrooms and schools? (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NETWORKING, PARTICIPATORY CULTURE, AND SCHOOLING (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observers are beginning to recognize that the social nature of learning and knowledge in digital social networks confounds education’s traditional focus on helping individual students master well-defined bodies of stable knowledge. Digital social networks are continually shaped by shared control (where content and expertise are continually co-created by participants) and transformative interaction (where individual users and groups of users are customizing both the content and format for enjoyment or ease of use) (Xenos &amp;amp; Foot, 2007). The knowledge in these networks is persistent, searchable, and easily replicable (boyd, 2008). In addition, many collaborative online resources rely on appropriation and repurposing of content, complicating the issue of plagiarism and introducing potentially offensive or objectionable content. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARTICIPATORY ASSESSMENT (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By treating conventional assessments and tests as “peculiar but necessary” forms of educational discourse (Hickey &amp;amp; Zuiker, 2005), we align classroom discourse to assessments and tests. However, we do so in a way that protects that discourse from classroom assessments. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concepts as Formalisms and Boundary Objects (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than working backward from the abstract definition of genre in the standards (e.g., Wiggins &amp;amp; McTighe, 2005), we work forward from the communal practices and the social and technological contexts in which students can use the idea of genre to engage with others around creative artifacts. In this sense, we characterize the proficiencies targeted by a particular curriculum and represented in externallydeveloped standards as formalisms (Barab &amp;amp; Roth, 2006), conceptual tools used to make meaning (i.e., enlisted) in particular discourse contexts. Participatory assessment helps students appreciate how core ideas like genre are enlisted differently in different contexts (e.g., genre study vs. remixing). In this sense, participatory assessment reframes literacies and language arts practices as “boundary objects” (Bowker &amp;amp; Star, 1999) that can inhabit multiple activity (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;systems. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH CONTEXT AND DESIGN (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment Development Effort and Examples (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinction between increasingly formal and abstract levels is crucial to participatory assessment. We label these levels immediate, close, proximal, distal, and remote. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediate-Level Event Reflections (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These assessments concern the enactment of a curricular activity in a particular classroom context. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two design features illustrate how these prompts are part of a larger, systematic approach. First, they are carefully phrased to focus on the activity, rather than individual understanding of a targeted formalism. In other words, they are carefully worded and aligned with the activity in order to focus students’ attention— and classroom discourse—around the domain-specific nuances that give the formalisms their communicative power. The second feature is their careful alignment with the close-level activity reflections that occur at the end of the activities. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close-Level Activity-Oriented Reflections (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These assessments are oriented toward the designed lesson (i.e., the way the lesson was intended), which is somewhat removed from the way that the lesson was enacted. Activity-oriented reflections consist of reflection questions posed to students after a lesson is completed. While still quite informal, these questions promote communal reflection on the practices (e.g., annotation and ornamentation) and formalisms (e.g., genre, remix, source material) around which the activity was designed. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the prior discussion of lurking, a core principle in participatory assessment is that prematurely and/or directly interrogating individuals has an evaluative tone and a summative function that undermines crucial initial participation. Immediate-level and close-level prompts focus discourse toward the curriculum and away from individual understanding and proficiency. We contend that deferring individual assessment lets students enlist the big ideas of the unit without the fear of doing so incorrectly; by carefully aligning these communal assessments to subsequent individual assessments, we provide useful motivation for students, feedback for teachers and designers, and evidence for skeptics. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proximal-Level Artifact-Oriented Reflections (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our initial implementation, the teacher graded both the artifact and the reflections. From a participatory perspective, grading both proved problematic. While the reflective rubric helped direct attention toward the big ideas and away from the specifics of the artifact, grading the artifacts directly still led students to insist on specific examples and guidelines and obstructed students’ ability to engage with the big ideas of the unit. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distal-Level Standards-Oriented Assessments (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distal-level assessments directly assess an individual student’s understanding of the targeted formalism(s), but they do so in a new and a more abstract context that is more akin to the way those formalisms are represented in content standards. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote-Level Achievement-Oriented Tests (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote-level tests are “achievement-oriented” because they measure gains in achievement of standards across multiple curricula, over longer timescales, and by various groups of students. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we worry that the “participation gap” in new media practices (Jenkins et al., 2009) will widen with increased use of integrated curricula and tests of 21st Century Skills.3 (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is difficult for two very different reasons. On one hand, our approach is solidly rooted in newer situative and participatory views of cognition and learning. These views have yet to receive wider acceptance and appreciation by the broader assessment and measurement community (Moss, Pullin, Gee, Haertel, &amp;amp; Young, 2008). Conversely, because our approach is designed to yield increased scores on externallydeveloped achievement measures, we anticipate puzzlement from innovators and educators who oppose the continued focus on such measures. We contend that participatory assessment can ultimately address the seemingly incompatible goals of these two very different communities. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is particularly useful:
  * It connects agency with ZPD, and makes it clear KB turns more agency to students and lets students decide ZPD.
  * It reports a set of interesting studies on student questioning, especially the one examining whether students can pick promising questions from those generated by themselves.
  * Although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly mention epistemology, it &amp;ldquo;makes clear that we need an epistemology more in keeping with group processes and with students&amp;rsquo; abilities to focus on promising ideas.  Thus the world 3 epistemology elaborated in the following article.&amp;rdquo; (quote from Marlene)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All points are useful for my thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Although adults and children both have zones of proximal development in
which more knowledgeable others play essential roles, there is a difference in
executive control that is most salient in question-answer dialogue. Adult
learners typically ask questions based on their perceived knowledge needs,
whereas with school children, questions are typically asked by the teacher,
based on the teacher&amp;rsquo;s perception of the child&amp;rsquo;s needs. Evidence shows that
children can produce and recognize educationally productive questions and
can adapt them to their knowledge needs. The challenge is to design
environments in which students can use such questions to guide their building
of knowledge, thus assuming a higher level of agency in learning. Computer
Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE), a computer-
supported knowledge medium designed to support intentional learning, is
described, with illustrations of children&amp;rsquo;s use of it in cooperative knowledge
building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the Teacher B and Teacher C models becomes, in
these terms, a difference in the control structure of activities in the zone of
proximal development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE ZONE OF PROXIMAL DEVELOPMENT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is growth toward children&amp;rsquo;s takeover of executive
functions -what amounts to control of the zone of proximal development
itself.
 The Teacher B model emphasizes
&amp;ldquo;growing into&amp;rdquo; more mature competence; the Teacher C model adds a
deliberate effort to promote &amp;ldquo;growing out o f &amp;lsquo; dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of what we learn as adults is through interaction with peers, where
the zone of proximal development is defined by activities the participants
can handle cooperatively better than they can alone. In such cases, control
of the zone is mutual. When we seek the help of someone more knowledge-
able, it is usually on our own terms. Although dependent on the other&amp;rsquo;s
competence, we retain the regulating role. We know what we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We question the maturity of adults who surrender control of their zones of
proximal development to a mentor or cult leader. But with children such
surrender is taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND OF CSILE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two principles illustrated here that we sought to generalize
through CSILE were (a) providing external supports for higher level
cognitive processes and (b) making metacognitive activity, which is nor-
mally hidden and private, overt and a subject for public consideration. This
attention to both the private and the public aspects of cognitive activity
remains characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE ROLE OF QUESTION ASKING IN CLASSROOMS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are focusing on question asking in this article because, as traditionally
carried out in schools, it epitomizes the teacher&amp;rsquo;s control over the zone of
proximal development and the unidirectional flow of information. Teachers
ask the questions, thereby determining the goals of learning activities, and
they evaluate the answers, thereby determining what is to be accepted as
knowledge (Sinclair &amp;amp; Coulthard, 1975)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical question-answer discourse of schooling provides no
means for the child to grow into the competencies that underlie the asking
of good questions.
Reciprocal teaching (Brown &amp;amp; Palincsar, 1989), by contrast, creates a
zone of proximal development in which children can grow into the asking of
text-based questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collins and Stevens
(1982) found the questions of skilled inquiry teachers to perform functions
such as the following:
  * Ask for sufficient factors.
  * Ask for similarities in factors between similar cases.
  * Ask for the formulation of an alternative rule.
  * Ask for predictions using hypothetical cases based on irrelevant or insufficient factors.
  * Ask questions that trap students into revealing their misconceptions.
  * Ask series of questions that lead students into a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen that question asking is a means by which teachers retain
control over the zone of proximal development. As Dillon (1982) put it:
&amp;ldquo;The dynamics of a question-answer relationship establish respondents in a
passive, reactive role, fostering dependency and removing a sense of
responsibility, initiative, and a kind of energy&amp;rdquo; (p. 160). Letting the children
ask the questions might therefore seem to be an obvious way of giving them
ownership over their zones of proximal development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAN CHILDREN ASK EDUCATIONALLY PRODUCTIVE QUESTIONS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUESTIONS PRODUCED UNDER TEXT-BASED AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED CONDITIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was what we call the
knowledge-based condition, because the students&amp;rsquo; prior knowledge was the
only basis on which their questions could be formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions from the knowledge-
based condition averaged significantly higher than those from the text-
based condition, with a mean of 2.52 versus a mean of 1.58.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More important than mean item quality, however, is the actual number
of items generated in a class that are judged to be educationally worthwhile
as guides to study and inquiry. In the text-based condition, 4 of the original
set of 104 questions (4%) were rated 3 or higher, indicating a judgment that
obtaining an answer to the question would produce &amp;ldquo;an advance in
conceptual understanding.&amp;rdquo; By contrast, 38 questions (46%) produced in
the knowledge-based condition were rated at this level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BASIC QUESTIONS AND WONDERMENT QUESTIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of domain knowledge, therefore, does not seem
to have hampered students in generating questions. Indications of the
students&amp;rsquo; limited knowledge about fossil fuels do appear, however, in the
kinds of questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half of the questions from the fossil fuels condition represent
what we may term basic information questions and uneducated guesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining 47 questions we may call wonderment questions. They
reflect curiosity, puzzlement, skepticism, or a knowledge-based specula-
tion, in contrast to a groping for basic orienting information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering jointly the questioning carried out on the topics of fossil
fuels and endangered species, it appears that the students appropriately
adjust the kinds of questions they ask, according to their level of
kn~wledge.~ If
 they already have a basic understanding of a topic, as with
endangered species, they ask questions that have potential to extend their
conceptual understanding. If they lack elementary knowledge, as with fossil
fuels, they ask questions of a basic &amp;ldquo;What is it? Where is it? What causes
it?&amp;rdquo; type. But the asking of such essential questions does not preclude their
also asking wonderment questions of a challenging and stimulating kind.
These findings thus indicate considerablepotential for children to take over
greater control of their zones of proximal development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAN STUDENTS IDENTIFY THE EDUCATIONALLY MOST VALUABLE QUESTIONS FROM AMONG THOSE THEY GENERATE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it becomes important to find out how successfully students can select ques-
tions to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of endangered species, where students already had some
basic understanding, there was a generally high level of agreement among
children and adults about what questions are of greater or lesser educational
value. Combined student ratings correlated .89 with experimenter ratings
of the 22 questions on this topic. The median correlation of individual
student ratings with experimenter ratings was .60 (n = 25 students) but with
a range of .37 to .90. For fossil fuels questions, however, the pooled-
ratings correlation was only 3 6 over 22 questions. The median correlation
for 24 students was .40 with a range of .14 to .66. In rating the fossil fuels
questions, students and adults seemed to agree in identifying what we have
called wonderment questions as being questions whose investigation will
lead to significant conceptual advance, but in judging basic information
questions, children seemed to have difficulty distinguishing naive questions
that are merely ill conceived from naive questions that raise important
conceptual issues. This was evident from interviews discussed in the full
report of this research (&lt;strong&gt;Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 1990&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What seems to be required, in order for
children successfully to assume executive control in their own zones of
proximal development in a classroom setting, is a social process that allows
the wisest judgments to work their way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COOPERATIVE KNOWLEDGE BUILDING IN A COMPUTER-SUPPORTED INTENTIONAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also indicate two needs, which we are trying to meet in the redesign of CSILE:
  More ways to link students with common interests.
  Support for pursuit of convergence and coherence.  Correspondingly, CSILE in its current
version lends itself nicely to divergent processes but lacks support for
convergence. Plans for the new architecture include special knowledge-
building environments. One will provide tools for describing and
simulating processes, specifically supporting the kind of constructive
interaction that Miyake (1986) found to go on when pairs of people are
trying to work out an understanding of a process. Another environment
will focus on explanatory coherence, providing an interface for organizing
networks of facts needing explaining and hypotheses explaining the facts,
based on Thagard&amp;rsquo;s (1989) computer implementation of his theory of
explanatory coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prospects for a Higher Level of Student Agency in Knowledge Building&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is then no question of displacing the teacher. Teachers can be vital
participants in the community knowledge-building process, but they need
no longer constrain it to what they comfortably know. The zone of
proximal development comes to be defined by the knowledge-building
activities that the group, as a collective, can profitably engage in.
Individual differences, so often a grave problem in school, can fall into
place naturally, if the point becomes that everyone should have something
to contribute rather than that everyone should try to excel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think this model has not had a chance in education because the
structure of the classroom has forced teachers to assume control of
knowledge building, whether as didactic conveyors of information or
as gentle managers of the intellectual life of the classroom. New knowledge
media open up new possibilities-both for democratizing the knowledge
resources available to schools and for moving knowledge building to the
center of the life of the classroom community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of acquiring a lexicon is clearly a process of learning from experience, and the relevant experience must be conversational interaction, because that is the context in which exposure to language occurs. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Social–Pragmatic View of the Role of Input (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do children find in conversation that is useful to word learning, and what is the nature of the word-learning mechanism that makes those particular things useful? (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two types of answers have been proposed. The first focuses on the social–pragmatic aspects of conversation and the social–cognitive abilities of children. According to this view children figure out the meaning of the words they hear to a substantial degree by inferring the speaker’s attentional focus and communicative intent (Akhtar &amp;amp; Tomasello, 2000; Baldwin, 2000). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second answer focuses on the data-providing aspects of conversation, arguing that the lexical content and syntactic structure of the utterances themselves, along with the accompanying nonlinguistic context, provide considerable information that children use in figuring out word meaning (Carey, 1978; Gillette, Gleitman, Gleitman, &amp;amp; Lederer, 1999; Gleitman, 1990; Siskind, 1996). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two proposals are not mutually exclusive. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, it is clear from a substantial body of naturalistic evidence and one experimental demonstration that when mothers structure children’s experiences so that input is responsive to the children’s verbalizations and matches children’s attentional focus, vocabulary development benefits. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empirical support for the notion that word learning is aided when the learner and speaker are mutually engaged is plentiful. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Word-Learning Task, Divided into Three Parts (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current research and theory suggest that the process of word learning consists of at least the following three components: word segmentation; an initial fast mapping of the new word onto a referent; and a longer, extended process of completing the lexical entry. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is worth noting that despite strong claims that language acquisition is a social process (e.g., Carpenter et al., 1998), there are components of language acquisition that social-process accounts have not addressed. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial fast mapping of a word results in only a partial lexical entry and is followed by a process in which the lexical entry is “completed slowly as the child encounters the word again and contrasts it with other words” (Carey, 1978, p. 292). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two measures were selected to index the degree to which maternal speech was likely to be referentially transparent by virtue of the social engagement of mother and child. The first was the number of maternal utterances produced during episodes of joint attention. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second measure of social engagement was the number of maternal utterances that were topiccontinuing replies to child speech, as an index of the contingency of maternal speech on child speech. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the basis of these speech samples, the total number of word types produced by each child was calculated using SALT. This count of word types in a speech sample does not provide an estimate of the size of the children’s total vocabularies, but it does provide estimates of the variety of vocabulary that children use. Therefore, we investigated how social– pragmatic properties of mother–child conversation and the data-providing properties of the maternal utterances produced in these conversations compare in terms of predicting children’s vocabulary diversity within a given fixed sample, not their entire vocabulary size (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, two other measures of the social–pragmatic aspects of interaction were calculated: (1) the number of maternal utterances judged to be behavior directives, and (2) the number of maternal utterances judged to be intended as conversation-eliciting questions. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the rich body of evidence on children’s capacities for joint attention and the evidence that time spent in joint attention predicts language development suggest that in the normal course of events, language acquisition is very much a social process. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social nature of humans and human interaction appear to do two things for language acquisition. One, social interaction provides the motivation and occasion for language use and thus brings the child into the context in which language-advancing data are provided. Second, children’s social cognitive capacities to infer the intentions of others may actually provide data about word reference that is used by the computational mechanism. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We describe a Web-based tool for creating and sharing annotations and investigate the eVect on learning of its use with college students. First, an annotation tool was designed and implemented for the research. Second, learning support mechanisms, including full and group annotation sharing, were developed to promote students’ motivation for annotation. Lastly, experiments with individual and shared annotation were conducted and the results show that the inXuence of annotation on learning performance becomes stronger with the use of sharing mechanisms. (p. 680)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we describe an attempt to provide an assistant annotation tool called VPen which enables readers make marks on Web-based reading materials. We have utilized this tool as part of an undergraduate course to study its usefulness and eVectiveness in learning. (p. 681)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literature review (p. 681)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1. Annotation and annotation systems (p. 681)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marshall (1997) proposed a division of annotation types into inexplicit and explicit. Explicit annotations (such as text) convey more meaning than inexplicit ones (such as highlight, underline, asterisk, arrow, and graphics). (p. 681)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many annotation systems have been proposed during the last decade. The major Annotea project is supported by the Worldwide Web Consortium as part of its Semantic Web development (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/&#34;&gt;http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/&lt;/a&gt;). Annotea enhances collaboration by sharing annotations, bookmarks, and their combinations. (p. 681)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis and Huttenlocher (1995) proposed a system called CoNote that enables a group of people to communicate via shared annotations on a set of electronic documents. They found that shared annotations of documents provide a richer communications forum than electronic media such as newsgroups, bulletin boards and email distribution lists. (p. 681)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LeeTiernan and Grudin (2001) proposed a prototype that allows viewers of audio and video to create and share text annotations that are synchronized with the multimedia. (p. 681)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ovsiannikov, Arbib, and Mcneill (1999) stated three ways in which annotation increases learning eYciency: it promotes memorization, thinking and clariWcation. (p. 681)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Characteristics of learner (p. 682)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Witkin et al., Weld-independent learners (FIs) tend to analyze, organize, and reorganize the location they perceive, whereas Weld-dependent learners (FDs) prefer structural instructional methods (Witkin and Goodenough, 1981). (p. 682)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this research, we have investigated the correlation between FI/FD cognitive styles and annotation behavior in a Web-based learning environment. A well-known educational FI/FD test called GEFT was proposed by Witkin et al in 1971 (Witkin, Oltman, Raskin, &amp;amp; Karp, 1971) and it is employed to assess the FI/FD cognitive styles of students in this research. (p. 682)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Technology acceptance model: TAM (p. 682)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was developed by Davis (1986) to evaluate how users come to accept and use a technology. Based on user acceptance of the technology, TAM theory proposes perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) to explain a user’s attitude toward a system. (p. 682)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4. Theories of collaborative and cooperative learning (p. 682)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) What are the students’ perceived attitudes toward VPen system after their usage? (2) What are the eVects of diVerent cognitive styles on annotation? (3) What are the eVects of diVerent annotation sharing scenarios on quantity of annotation and its inXuence toward learning achievements? (4) What is the relationship between quantity of annotation and learning achievements? Is there a signiWcant diVerence in quantity of annotation between high achievement students and low achievement ones? (p. 683)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other features of VPen system are as follows: (1) VPen is compatible with HTML-based materials, so no extra eVort is required during the process of material design. Once HTML-based materials are loaded through a loader program provided by the system, all annotation functionalities of the system are automatically embedded in the materials. (2) The system can automatically store annotation information made by students to an external database. (p. 687)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.5. Research variables (p. 688)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The independent variables of this research are: (1) FI/FD cognitive styles and (2) learning scenarios. The dependent variables are (1) quantity of annotation and (2) learning achievements. (p. 688)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.3. Results of questionnaire analysis (p. 689)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;most of the students think that the annotation system did improve their online reading performance; that is, the annotation was useful for them. Most of the students also perceived that it was easy to use the annotation system. (p. 689)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to explore this supposition, some Web log data are further extracted and analyzed. (p. 696)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusion and discussion (p. 697)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, according to the results of GEFT test, there was no signiWcant diVerence between Weldindependent and Weld-dependent cognitive style students on quantity of annotation. (p. 697)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the analysis show that use of the VPen annotation system can raise students’ learning achievements in most scenarios, and the proposition “those who have the will to utilize the annotation tools in online reading materials make higher achievements in learning” proposed by Nokelainen et al. was supported. (p. 697)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it was found that in a particular scenario (Wnal examination), the high motivation of students to study for Wnal exams produced results for the control class (learning without annotation system) that were similar to those of the experiment class (learning with annotation). (p. 697)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a ceiling eVect due to high motivation to study for Wnal exams no matter what kind of tools or scenarios were provided. (p. 698)&lt;/p&gt;

In the 5th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (pp. 57–64). Retrieved from &lt;a href=&#34;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED537192.pdf&#34;&gt;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED537192.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core algorithm employs sequence mining techniques to identify differentially frequent patterns between two predefined groups. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developing a computer-based learning environment (CBLE) called Betty’s Brain, we have adopted a self-regulated learning (SRL) framework to help students develop learning strategies. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify important activity patterns in a comparison between two sets of action sequences, our methodology employs a novel combination of sequence mining techniques. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequential pattern mining [2] methods find the most frequent action patterns across a set of action sequences, while episode mining [11] discovers the most frequently used action patterns within a given sequence. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of our differential sequence mining algorithm are presented in [8], but we briefly outline the main steps of the algorithm. First, a sequential pattern mining algorithm (SPAMc [6]) identifies the patterns that meet a minimum s-support constraint within each group, employing a maximum gap constraint to account for noise, which is interpreted as a small number of irrelevant actions that may be interspersed in a pattern. In this paper, we employ a gap constraint of 1, i.e., we allow at most one irrelevant action between each consecutive action in a pattern. To compare the identified s-frequent patterns across groups, we calculate the mean i-support of every pattern for each group. In order to identify patterns whose usage more clearly differ between the two groups, we also filter the patterns based on the p value of a t-test comparing pattern i-support between the groups. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, high-performing students differentially employed reading behaviors that indicated a more careful and systematic strategy of reading. Their activity patterns more frequently involved re-reading pages from the resources, such as employing full-length re-reads of the resources before adding a link. Further, the reading activity patterns distinguishing high-performers from low-performers usually involved reading pages that were relevant to recent actions, suggesting a more systematic reading behavior overall. Productive periods were particularly distinguished in high performers by a larger number of full-length, relevant re-read actions. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance was also linked to monitoring behaviors that incorporated re-reading of the resource material. In particular, high-performers were more likely to employ various types of reading actions both before and after assessments of progress/correctness using the quiz. Low performers, on the other hand, had a differential tendency to use irrelevant, extended re-reads of pages in the resources during productive periods. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literature review
  * the simplest form of conceptual change: enrichment&amp;ndash;accumulation on the level of specific theory
  * revision: reorganization of knowledge on the level of the framework theory&amp;mdash;so more difficult and need specific instruction
  * problem: students are not aware the contradiction, so tend to enrich rather than revise them.
  * Learners acquired lot of facts and added new explanations to the representations they already had, but were not able to apply them in solving problems
  * Presenting a cognitive conﬂict does notseem to be enough for promoting conceptual change (Caravita &amp;amp; Hallden, 1994, p. 95; Limon &amp;amp; Carretero, 1997, p. 218).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Textbook&amp;ndash;what type of text could promote conceptual change in relation to scientiﬁc topics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang and Andre (1991):“conceptual change text”
    * to elicit students’ common misconceptions
    * to activate the students’ existing schemata
    * provide information countering the misconceptions
    * however, a traditional expository text; hard to distinguish whether the diagrams cause the gains
  Guzzetti et al. (1992): find a type of text which has been proved to foster conceptual change
    * a refutational text which attempted to create a cognitive conﬂict and explain why the naive conception is incorrect seemed to be more effective&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the difference with younger and older students
young students&amp;mdash;lack of metaconceptual awareness, then conflict and discomfort will not lead to revision of the framework theory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mental model&amp;mdash;the very criterion of text comprehension
connecting prior knowledge and text information&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;recognition of the differences between naive and scientiﬁc representations&amp;mdash;an important prerequisite for conceptual change
this study: text characteristics which stimulate metaconceptual awareness&amp;mdash;an even more crucial factor
text design: a refutational text&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main differences in the two versions of text are as follows:
(a) macro-level organisation: start from energy&amp;mdash;all creatures need energy to live, and plants can make energy by themselves; water as an energy
(b) textual units inducing metaconceptual awareness.
points out the difference between possible misconceptions of the learner and the scientiﬁc thinking concerning photosynthesis
keep the reader on the right path to construct an adequate mental model
there are seven metaconceptual text elements
* this sentence is interesting. i wonder whether there is any other way to keep students on the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretest-posttest questions
(1) Retention questions (2) Inferential text comprehension questions (3) Critical distinction questions (4) Generative questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results
treatment effect on (3) Critical distinction questions and (4) Generative questions
but not on (1) and (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;leave some research questions to be investigatedhow long lasting and stable are the conceptual changes generated? the interaction between levels of text comprehension and conceptual change is an interesting question for future studies
the effect of text design on conceptual change could also be related to the text comprehension process
the role of pictures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiang, F., Wang, J., Hindle, A., &amp;amp; Nascimento, M. A. (2013). Mining the Temporal Evolution of the Android Bug Reporting Community via Sliding Windows. CoRR, abs/1310.7. Retrieved from &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7469&#34;&gt;http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7469&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper reports a study of applying an interesting &lt;em&gt;sliding-windows&lt;/em&gt; social network analysis on Android bug reporting community. This technique shows clear advantage in comparison with global analysis of social networks in that it takes temporal information into consideration. It is especially useful for studying interactions that expand over an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For user clustering specifically, this study applies K-means clustering on betweenness centrality measures across sliding windows. This is radically different from clustering based on interaction structure in a global analysis of social network. The clustering used in this paper has great value. (In addition, this study normalized the betweenness centrality measure so that it will not be affected by the size of networks; when comparing sums of centrality measure across time, note that the total number of participants stay the same. So comparisons made in this study are quite meaningful to me.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for tools like Social Network Analysis (SNA), a global analysis can miss a lot of important interactions (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to apply SNA to the bug repository, we first create the graph based on the interactions. We pose that each node of the graph represents one bug participant and each edge represents the connection between two participants who have communicated on the same bug. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use betweenness centrality to quantify the importance of a participant in the community &lt;a href=&#34;p. 2&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When participants have high betweenness, they might have: 1) reported quantities of bugs with at least one comment on them, 2) made lots of comments, 3) reported a very critical bug which attracts comments, 4) or made a very interesting comment which attracts comments from other participants. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to peer into these local self organized structures using social network analysis, we felt it is better to choose a windowed approach, [3, 14]. Windowing allows us to look at network during a slice of time and then relate our measures (betweenness centrality per author) to the next window and beyond. This sliding window view of centrality allows us to see those developers and users who are constantly at the forefront of discussion or those who ebb and flow between issues and tasks. Moreover, by sliding windows, each pair of adjacent windows would have an overlap, which results in smoother trends, and more importantly, helps to maintain context. Other benefits provided by time windowed analysis is that it gives a more accurate and nuanced view of the data as locally central participants then will not be “drowned out”. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global research questions: RQ1. How does the number of active bug participants change over time? Why? RQ2. How does the betweenness centrality of a participant change over time? What are the reasons when they have a certain activity pattern? Local research questions: RQ3. Are there special time ranges during which participants are more/less active or central than normal? Why? RQ4. What are the possible scenarios for a very sharp change of the participants’ centrality? Why? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Background (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1 Betweenness Centrality (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our work, we normalize the betweenness centrality values to eliminate the effect of different sizes of the networks. The betweenness is normalized as: (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with simply counting the total number of comments or total bug reports of a participant, betweenness acts better to reflect the interactions among people. For example, when a person reports lots of bugs but none of them attract any comment, it is very likely that his bug reports are not interesting or important. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2 Overlapping Time Windowing (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, time windowed analysis could give a more accurate and nuanced view of the data [3, 14], as locally central participants would not be “drowned out”. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point is that, comments on the same bug might not be globally temporally relevant [17, 18] thus a global time analysis would not make much sense in this case. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2: Betweenness centrality along time line: the x-axis represents the number of time windows and the starting dates are denoted every 100 windows. The y-axis represents the number of bug participants who have ever been central in the bug community with betweenness centrality valued greater than 0 for some time period. The color represents the value of betweenness centrality, with darker colors corresponding to lower betweenness and lighter colors for higher betweenness. We used K-means clustering with cosine distance where K = 100 (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3 Clustering (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3(1) orders participants by their betweenness values. We can indeed find that there are participants of low overall betweenness but being very active (show up bright) (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to perceive clusters, that are local groups of interactions, we clustered the bug participants using K-means by their betweenness centrality distribution along the time line. K-means is one of the most popular clustering methods which aims to partition n data items into k clusters that each data item belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean [19]. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, cosine distance calculates the similarity between each pair of participants in terms of temporal centrality whereas Euclidean distance focuses on the magnitude of data, the size and frequency of centrality. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Methodology (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Data (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Pruning the data. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Windowing the records. We windowed the data into periods of 30 days with a 29-day overlap. 30 days was chosen as a window size because it is smaller than the periods between a major and minor release, it is similar to a month of work, but long enough to contain the resolution of multiple bugs. We have compared sliding by 1 day with our previous result of sliding by 7 days, 1 day sliding produces gradual and smoother transitions of centrality. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Establishing the network. We made a tool to perform the SNA with sliding windows. The tool is implemented in Java and built on top of the JUNG Graph Framework, that converted bug reports and bug comment records within a window to a social network graph. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Calculating the centrality. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Removing irrelevant participants. We removed the participants with betweenness centrality value 0 (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Generating the analysis graph. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3 Validation using the Android Release History and the Git (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Results and Analysis (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ1. How does the number of active bug participants change over time? Why? To give an overview, we compared the interaction of bug participants between January, 2010 and December, 2011, and found that the interaction among participants in the Android bug community in 2011 was similar to the interaction of participants in 2010 but more frequent, as we can see in Figure 2. One “gap” occurs around window 300, which we will explain in the next Local Analysis subsection. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ2. How does the betweenness centrality of a participant change over time? What are the reasons when they have a certain activity pattern? Observing the continuity of betweenness centrality in Figure 2, some participants have kept active during the entire two years, and correspondingly they have a very continuous and bright line. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in most cases, participants’ betweenness values are highly variant, as observed in Figure 2. To investigate the variation in betweenness values over time, we decided to count the number of times that a user experienced a range of consecutive (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;windows in which the user had non-zero betweenness. Participants with a count of distinct ranges greater than 1 would be phasers who periodically participate within the Android bug community. Here phasers are those who phase into centrality and later out of it. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;among the 1654 participants with betweenness values larger than 0, we analyzed their centrality patterns and divide them into three categories: 1) participants appeared only once with a betweeness greater than 0 (71 out of 1654 participants), 2) participants recurred periodically (1575 participants) and 3) participants who are central along the entire project history (8 participants). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ4. What are the possible scenarios for a very sharp change of the participants’ centrality? Why? (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;almost all of them has experienced centrality oscillations. In addition, some participants tend to become active and core members during the same time period and then they fade away together. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 Validation (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.1 Activity pattern validation (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we notice that there is a small group of participants who have been central for most of our analysis period (8 participants out of the 1654); another relatively larger group appear without any recurrence (71 participants out of the 1654); the majority would periodically become central in their community (1575 participants out of the 1654). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.1.1 Participants that appeared only once tend to be pure users We look into the git repository to find the files submitted by the 71 participants who have appeared only once in the bug community. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.1.2 Participants showed up periodically should be a combination of users and developers Periodically appearing participants are the majority and we call them phasers. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.1.3 Participants who were continuously central for a long time period could have multiple areas of expertise 5 out of the 8 participants in this group have submissions in the git. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2 Cluster validation (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2.1 Participants clustered together share similar areas of expertise and tasks (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2.2 Clusters’ working areas of expertise are in accordance with the release contents along the time line (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate challenge considers the extent to which data mining’s outcomes are themselves ethical with respect to both individuals and institutions. A deep challenge, not readily apparent to institutional researchers or administrators, considers the implications of uncritical understanding of the scientific basis of data mining. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges can be met by understanding data mining as part of a value-laden nexus of problems, models, and interventions; by protecting the contextual integrity of information flows; and by ensuring both the scientific and normative validity of data mining applications. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of data mining is to identify relationships among variables that may not be immediately apparent using hypothesis-driven methods. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker suggests four areas of application: building student models to individualize instruction, mapping learning domains, evaluating the pedagogical support from learning management systems, and scientific discovery about learners.6 Kumar and Chadha suggest using data mining in organizing curriculum, predicting registration, predicting student performance, detecting cheating in online exams, and identifying abnormal or erroneous data.7 More recent (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;applications have embraced such suggestions, exploring course recommendation systems, retention, student performance, and assessment.8 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;data mining is gaining hold operationally at the institutional level, predicting student success and personalizing content in online and traditional courses; making Netflix-style course recommendations, monitoring student progress through their academic programs, and sometimes intervening to force student action; modeling campus personal networks and student behavior with an eye toward identifying lack of social integration and impending withdrawal from the institution based on facilities usage, administrative data, and social network data. Admissions and recruiting are also growth areas for data mining. 9 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;consequentialism-the-immediate-challenge-p-3&#34;&gt;Consequentialism: The Immediate Challenge (p. 3)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent of these are the related problems of privacy and individuality. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;consent (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data mining can create group profiles that become the persons represented, treating the subject as a collection of attributes rather than a whole individual and interfere with (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;treating the subject as more than a final predictive value or category.14 (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the students, far from being understood as individuals, are simply bundles of skills that need to be matched to an outcome. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;undermine individuals’ autonomy (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a classic example of paternalism, the “use of coercion to make people morally better.”18 (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An especially complicated form of interference is the creation of disciplinary systems, wherein the control of minutiae and constant surveillance lead subjects to choose the institutionally preferred action rather than their own preference, a system that generally disregards autonomy. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;scientism-the-deep-challenge-p-5&#34;&gt;Scientism: The Deep Challenge (p. 5)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the most difficult challenges may be ones of which institutional researchers are least aware. In the process of designing a data mining process, institutional researchers build both empirical and normative assumptions, meanings, and values into the data mining process. These choices are often obscured by a strong tendency toward scientism among data scientists. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientism is a trap that, if not avoided, can do substantial harm to students. But unfortunately, current examples of data mining in higher education have embraced, rather than rejected, scientism. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one of the key recent findings in both the philosophy and the sociology of science is the value-ladenness of science and technology. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vialardi and colleagues note that predictive analytic models “are based on the idea that individuals with approximately the same profile generally select and/or prefer the same things.”24 This very behaviorist model of human nature is at the foundation of every data model. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;practical-ethics-for-ethical-data-mining-p-6&#34;&gt;Practical Ethics for Ethical Data Mining (p. 6)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ethical questions presented in data mining will be clearer when building a data mining model is situated in relation to the perceived need for the policy, the interventions that are proposed, the expected outcomes of the policy, and the ways in which the policy will be evaluated; problems such as incompatibilities between the assumptions of the data model and those of the intervention will only be apparent from this perspective. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, where there are gaps in the reasoning researchers should identify the assumptions that allowed those gaps to be bridged uncritically and then subject those assumptions to critical analysis. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to these problems that allows for a comprehensive analysis without an extensive technical background in ethics is to consider the contextual integrity of data mining practices.26 (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it can be expanded to include respecting the integrity of the individual and of the university. As actors within the informational context, changes to how the actors understand themselves are equivalent to changes in the actors, and the actors’ goals and values are themselves part of the context whose integrity is to be maintained. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purposes of this article are to position mixed methods research (mixed research is a synonym) as the natural complement to tradi- tional qualitative and quantitative research, to present pragmatism as offering an attractive philosophical partner for mixed methods re- search, and to provide a framework for designing and conducting mixed methods research. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative purists (also called constructivists and interpretivists) reject what they call positivism. They argue for the superiority of constructivism, idealism, relativism, humanism, hermeneutics, and, sometimes, postmodernism (Guba &amp;amp; Lincoln, 1989; Lincoln &amp;amp; Guba, 2000; Schwandt, 2000; Smith, 1983, 1984). These purists contend that multiple-constructed realities abound, that time- and context-free generalizations are neither desirable nor possible, that research is value-bound, that it is impossible to dif- ferentiate fully causes and effects, that logic flows from specific to general (e.g., explanations are generated inductively from the data), and that knower and known cannot be separated because the subjective knower is the only source of reality (Guba, 1990). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sets of purists view their paradigms as the ideal for re- search, and, implicitly if not explicitly, they advocate the in- compatibility thesis (Howe, 1988), which posits that qualitative and quantitative research paradigms, including their associated methods, cannot and should not be mixed. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative purists (Ayer, 1959; Maxwell &amp;amp; Delaney, 2004; Popper, 1959; Schrag, 1992) articulate assumptions that are con- sistent with what is commonly called a positivist philosophy.3, 4 (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disturbing fea- ture of the paradigm wars has been the relentless focus on the differences between the two orientations. Indeed, the two dom- inant research paradigms have resulted in two research cultures, “one professing the superiority of ‘deep, rich observational data’ and the other the virtues of ‘hard, generalizable’ &amp;hellip; data” (Sieber, 1973, p. 1335). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this school of thought, educational re- searchers should eliminate their biases, remain emotionally de- tached and uninvolved with the objects of study, and test or empirically justify their stated hypotheses. These researchers have traditionally called for rhetorical neutrality (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope the field will move beyond quantitative versus qualitative research arguments because, as recognized by mixed methods research, both quantitative and qualitative research are important and useful. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We contend that epistemological and methodological pluralism should be promoted in educational research so that researchers are informed about epistemological and methodological possibilities and, ultimately, so that we are able to conduct more effective re- search. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;increasingly inter- disciplinary, complex, and dynamic; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meth- odological work on the mixed methods research paradigm can be seen in several recent books (Brewer &amp;amp; Hunter, 1989; Creswell, 2003; Greene, Caracelli, &amp;amp; Graham, 1989; Johnson &amp;amp; Christensen, 2004; Newman &amp;amp; Benz, 1998; Reichardt &amp;amp; Rallis, 1994; Tashakkori &amp;amp; Teddlie, 1998, 2003). Much work remains to be undertaken in the area of mixed methods research regarding its philosophical positions, designs, data analysis, va- lidity strategies, mixing and integration procedures, and ratio- nales, among other things. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many research procedures or methods typically have been linked to certain paradigms, this linkage between research paradigm and research methods is nei- ther sacrosanct nor necessary (Howe, 1988, 1992). For example, qualitative researchers should be free to use quantitative meth- ods, and quantitative researchers should be free to use qualitative methods. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the argument is sensible but not convincing enough. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commonalities Among the Traditional Paradigms (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophical Issues Debates (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted by Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie (2003), some individuals who engage in the qualitative versus quantitative paradigm debate appear to confuse the logic of justification with research methods. That is, there is a tendency among some researchers to treat epistemology and method as being synonymous (Bryman, 1984; Howe, 1992). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sechrest and Sidani (1995, p. 78) point out that both methodologies “describe their data, construct explana- tory arguments from their data, and speculate about why the outcomes they observed happened as they did.” (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is when terms get mixed up &amp;ndash; paradigms and methodologies are both used to describe qual and quan. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, differences in epistemologi- cal beliefs (such as a difference in beliefs about the appropriate logic of justification) should not prevent a qualitative researcher from utilizing data collection methods more typically associated with quantitative research, and vice versa. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;paradigmatic orientation (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n the social and behavioral sciences, this goal of under- standing leads to the examination of many different phenomena, including holistic phenomena such as intentions, experiences, at- titudes, and culture, as well as more reductive phenomena such as macromolecules, nerve cells, micro-level homunculi, and bio- chemical computational systems (de Jong, 2003). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, on the “positivist” side of the fence, the barriers that quantitative educational researchers have built arise from a narrow definition of the concept of “science.” 6 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic agreement has been reached on each of the following issues: (a) the relativity of the “light of reason” (i.e., what appears reasonable can vary across per- sons); (b) theory-laden perception or the theory-ladenness of facts (i.e., what we notice and observe is affected by our background knowledge, theories, and experiences; in short, observation is not a perfect and direct window into “reality”); &amp;copy; underdeter- mination of theory by evidence (i.e., it is possible for more than one theory to fit a single set of empirical data); (d) the Duhem- Quine thesis or idea of auxiliary assumptions (i.e., a hypothesis cannot be fully tested in isolation because to make the test we also must make various assumptions; the hypothesis is embedded in a holistic network of beliefs; and alternative explanations will continue to exist); (e) the problem of induction (i.e., the recogni- tion that we only obtain probabilistic evidence, not final proof in empirical research; in short, we agree that the future may not re- semble the past); (f) the social nature of the research enterprise (i.e., researchers are embedded in communities and they clearly have and are affected by their attitudes, values, and beliefs); and (g) the value-ladenness of inquiry (this is similar to the last point but specifically points out that human beings can never be com- pletely value free, and that values affect what we choose to in- vestigate, what we see, and how we interpret what we see). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative researchers also are not immune from constructive criticism. Some qualitative purists (e.g., Guba, 1990) openly admit that they adopt an unqualified or strong relativism, which is logically self-refuting and (in its strong form) hinders the de- velopment and use of systematic standards for judging research quality (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pragmatism as the Philosophical Partner for Mixed Methods Research (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, subjective states (i.e., cre- ated and experienced realities) that vary from person to person and that are sometimes called “realities” should probably be called (for the purposes of clarity and greater precision) multiple perspectives or opinions or beliefs (depending on the specific phe- nomenon being described) rather than multiple realities (Phillips &amp;amp; Burbules, 2000). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixed methods research should, instead (at this time), use a method and philosophy that attempt to fit together the in- sights provided by qualitative and quantitative research into a workable solution. Along these lines, we advocate consideration of the pragmatic method of the classical pragmatists (e.g., Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey) as a way for researchers to think about the traditional dualisms that have been debated by the purists. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agree with qualitative researchers that value stances are often needed in research; however, it also is important that research is more than simply one researcher’s highly idiosyncratic opinions written into a report. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;many strategies are recognized and regularly used in qualitative research (such as member check- ing, triangulation, negative case sampling, pattern matching, ex- ternal audits) to help overcome this potential problem and produce high-quality and rigorous qualitative research. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;providing an adequate rationale for interpretations of their data (Onwuegbuzie, 2000), and qualitative methods of analyses too “often remain private and unavailable for public inspection” (Constas, 1992, p. 254). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reject an incompatibilist, either/or approach to paradigm selection and we recommend a more pluralistic or compatibilist approach. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on Peirce’s lead, James (1995, 1907 original) argued that “The pragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that otherwise might be interminable&amp;hellip; . The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical con- sequences” (p. 18). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dewey (1948, 1920 original) stated that “in order to discover the meaning of the idea [we must] ask for its consequences” (p. 132). In short, when judging ideas we should consider their empirical and practical consequences. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in Table 1, what we believe are classical pragmatism’s most general and important characteristics. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we endorse pragmatism as a philosophy that can help to build bridges between conflicting philosophies, pragma- tism, like all current philosophies, has some shortcomings. In Table 2 we present some of these. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practic- ing researchers (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Research (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixed methods research is formally defined here as the class of re- search where the researcher mixes or combines quantitative and qual- itative research techniques, methods, approaches, concepts or language into a single study. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are advocating a needs-based or contingency approach to research method and concept selection. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its logic of inquiry includes the use of induction (or discovery of patterns), deduction (testing of theories and hypotheses), and abduction (uncovering and relying on the best of a set of explanations for understanding one’s results) (e.g., de Waal, 2001). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it offers an immediate and useful middle position philosophically and meth- odologically; it offers a practical and outcome-oriented method of inquiry that is based on action and leads, iteratively, to further action and the elimination of doubt (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most fundamental is the research question— research methods should follow research questions (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prefers action to philosophizing (pragmatism is, in a sense, an anti-philosophy). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaining an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of quantitative and qualitative research puts a researcher in a posi- tion to mix or combine strategies and to use what Johnson and Turner (2003) call the fundamental principle of mixed research. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;corroborated (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;many other typologies (especially Creswell, 1994; Morgan, 1998; Morse, 1991; Patton, 1990; and Tashakkori &amp;amp; Teddlie, 1998) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one can construct mixed-model designs by mixing qualitative and quantitative approaches within and across the stages of research (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tables 3 and 4 are specifically designed to aid in the con- struction of a combination of qualitative and quantitative re- search. After determining one’s research question(s), one can decide whether mixed research offers the best potential for an an- swer; if this is the case, then one can use the tables as an aid to help in deciding on the combination of complementary strengths and nonoverlapping weaknesses that is appropriate for a partic- ular study. Table 5 shows some of the strengths and weaknesses of mixed methods research, which should aid in the decision to use or not use a mixed methods research approach for a given re- search study. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Morgan (1998) and Morse (1991), one also may consider the dimension of paradigm emphasis (de- ciding whether to give the quantitative and qualitative compo- nents of a mixed study equal status or to give one paradigm the dominant status). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development of a Mixed Methods Research Typology (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mixed-method designs (discussed below) are based on the crossing of paradigm emphasis and time ordering of the quantitative and qualitative phases. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To construct a mixed-method design, the researcher must make two primary decisions: (a) whether one wants to operate largely within one dominant paradigm or not, and (b) whether one wants to conduct the phases concurrently or sequentially. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the degree of mixture, which would form a continuum from monomethod to fully mixed methods. Another dimen- sion pertains to where mixing should occur (e.g., in the objec- tive[s], methods of data collection, research methods, during data analysis, data interpretation). Yet another important dimension is whether one wants to take a critical theory/ transformative-emancipatory (Mertens, 2003) approach or a less explicitly ideological approach to a study. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mixed-method designs are similar to conducting a quantitative mini-study and a qualitative mini-study in one overall research study (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward a Parsimonious Typology of Mixed Research Methods (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;two major types of mixed methods research: mixed-model (mixing qualitative and quantitative approaches within or across the stages of the research process) and mixed- method (the inclusion of a quantitative phase and a qualitative phase in an overall research study). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is for the researcher to be creative and not be limited by the designs listed in this article. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tenet of mixed methods research is that researchers should mindfully create designs that effectively answer their re- search questions; this stands in contrast to the common approach in traditional quantitative research where students are given a menu of designs from which to select. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mixed Methods Research Process Model (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mixed methods research process model comprises eight dis- tinct steps: (1) determine the research question; (2) determine whether a mixed design is appropriate; (3) select the mixed- method or mixed-model research design; (4) collect the data; (5) analyze the data; (6) interpret the data; (7) legitimate the data; and (8) draw conclusions (if warranted) and write the final report. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three steps in the mixed methods research process warrant some further discussion, especially purpose (Step 2), data analy- sis (Step 5), and legitimation (Step 7). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data integration characterizes the final stage, whereby both quantitative and qualitative data are integrated into either a coherent whole or two separate sets (i.e., qualitative and quantitative) of coherent wholes. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) triangulation (i.e., seeking conver- gence and corroboration of results from different methods and designs studying the same phenomenon); (b) complementarity (i.e., seeking elaboration, enhancement, illustration, and clarifi- cation of the results from one method with results from the other method); &amp;copy; initiation (i.e., discovering paradoxes and contra- dictions that lead to a re-framing of the research question); (d) de- velopment (i.e., using the findings from one method to help inform the other method); and (e) expansion (i.e., seeking to ex- pand the breadth and range of research by using different meth- ods for different inquiry components). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legitimation step involves assessing the trustworthiness of both the qualitative and quantitative data and subsequent inter- pretations. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative Legitimation Model (Onwuegbuzie, 2003 (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative Legitimation Model (Onwuegbuzie, 2000; Onwuegbuzie, Jiao, &amp;amp; Bostick, 2004 (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to these authors, the seven data analysis stages are as follows: (a) data reduction, (b) data display, &amp;copy; data transformation, (d) data cor- relation, (e) data consolidation, (f) data comparison, and (g) data integration. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data reduction involves reducing the dimensionality of the qualitative data (e.g., via exploratory thematic analysis, memoing) and quantitative data (e.g., via descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis). Data display, in- volves describing pictorially the qualitative data (e.g., matrices, charts, graphs, networks, lists, rubrics, and Venn diagrams) and quantitative data (e.g., tables, graphs). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Future of Mixed Methods Research in Education (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;data transformation stage, wherein quantitative data are converted into narrative data that can be analyzed qualitatively (i.e., qualitized; Tashakkori &amp;amp; Teddlie, 1998) and/or qualitative data are converted into numerical codes that can be represented statistically (i.e., quantitized; Tashakkori &amp;amp; Teddlie, 1998). Data correlation involves the quantitative data being correlated with the qualitized data or the qualitative data being correlated with the quantitized data. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;data consolidation, wherein both quantitative and qualitative data are combined to create new or consolidated variables or data sets. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general we recommend contingency theory for research approach selection, which accepts that quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research are all superior under different cir- (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGURE 3. Mixed research process model. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cumstances and it is the researcher’s task to examine the specific contingencies and make the decision (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By narrowing the divide between quanti- tative and qualitative researchers, mixed methods research has a great potential to promote a shared responsibility in the quest for attaining accountability for educational quality. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activ- ity theory is a socio-cultural, socio-historical lens through which designers can analyze human activity systems. It focuses on the inter- action of human activity and consciousness within its relevant environmental context. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity the- ory posits that conscious learning emerges from activity (performance), not as a precursor to it. So activity theory provides us with an alternative way of viewing human thinking and activity. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory is a powerful socio-culturat and socio-historical lens through which we can analyze most forms of human activity. It focuses on the interaction of human activity and con- sciousness (the human mind as whole) within its relevant environmental context. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a useful framework because the assumptions of activity theory are very conso- nant with those of constructivism, situated learning, distributed cognitions, case-based rea- soning, social cognition, and everyday cognition that underlie CLEs (Jonassen &amp;amp; Land, 1999). It is also useful because activity theory has been used often enough in designing human-computer interactions in order to provide a clear opera- tional framework for designing CLEs. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity the- ory is a useful framework for understanding the totality of human work and praxis (Bodker, 1991a), that is, activity in context. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we first elaborate the assump- tions that underlie activity theory, then describe the components of an activity system, and finally describe how activity theory may be used to analyze activities and settings for the purpose of designing CLEs. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACTIVITY THEORY (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory has its roots in the classical Ger- man philosophy of Kant and Hegel which emphasized both the historical development of ideas as well as the active and constructive role of humans. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACTIVITY SYSTEM (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most appropriate unit of analysis is activity. The components of any activity are organized into activity systems (Engestr6m, 1987), a model of which is depicted as a triangle in Figure 1 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory is not a methodology. Rather it is a &amp;ldquo;philosophical framework for studying differ- ent forms of human praxis as developmental processes, both individual and social levels interlinked at the same time&amp;rdquo; (p. 532). Activity theory adopts Marx&amp;rsquo;s dialectic materialist view of activity and consciousness as dynamically interrelated (Leont&amp;rsquo;ev, 1972) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary focus of activity systems analysis is the top triangle of Figure I (the production of some object), in which the activity is accomplished. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activity consists of a goal-directed hierar- chy of actions (see Figure 2) that are used to accomplish the object&amp;ndash;the tasks, actions, and operations that transform the object. Activity (e.g., designing instructional materials) is the performance of conscious actions and consists of chains of actions (such as needs assessment, objective writing, drawing graphics, shooting video, etc.). Actions are chains of operations (e.g., camera operations, spreadsheet entries, telephone calls). All operations are actions when they are first performed because they require conscious effort to perform. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject of any activity is the individual or group of actors engaged in the activity. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With practice and internalization, activities collapse into actions and eventually into operations, as they become more automatic, requiring less conscious effort. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object of the activity is the physical or mental product that is sought. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools can be anything used in the transfor- mation process (physical such as hammers or computers or mental, such as models or heuris- tics). The use of culture-specific tools shapes the way people act and think. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the tools alter the activity and are, in turn, altered by the activity. For example, using an inquiry design model will result in dramati- cally different instructional materials (object) than a direct instruction model. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASSUMPTIONS OF ACTIVITY THEORY (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity: Minds in Context (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most fundamental assumption of activity theory is the unity of consciousness and activity (Kaptelinin, 1996). Activities are the human interactions with the objective world and the conscious activities that are a part of those inter- actions. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learner (the subject in activity systems, see Figure 1) is the central, driving character in defining activity. While traditional theories of learning assume a Cartesian mind-body dual- ism with respect to the mind and external behavior, activity theory challenges that separa- tion. Mind and body (mental and physical) are interrelated, so knowing can only be interpreted in the context of doing. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory focuses on the purposeful actions that are realized through conscious intentions. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consciousness in the World (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is n o t a set of discrete, disembodied acts(e.g.,decisionmaking, classifying,remembering) thatareregulatedbyexecutivecontrolmechanisms (Nardi,1996),which is the way that instructional designers typically analyze conscious knowledge. Rather, consciousness is the phenomenon that unifies attention, intention, memory, reasoning, and speech (Vygotsky, 1978). Consciousness is manifested in practice&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;you are what you do&amp;rdquo; (p.7). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object-Orientedness (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object of activity can be anything, so long as it can be transformed by subjects of the activity system. Objects may be physical objects (e.g., a house that is built), soft objects (e.g., computer program), or conceptual objects (e.g., a theory or model of activity that is negotiated). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, consciousness is embedded in the wider activity system that surrounds an individual&amp;rsquo;s activities, so that changes in the physical, mental, or social conditions of a person&amp;rsquo;s situation are internalized and directly reflected in the person&amp;rsquo;s conscious activities. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intentlonallty (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical-CulturalDimension (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity is a historically developed phenomenon. That is, activities evolve over time within a culture. In order to understand the dynamics of a particular situation, it is necessary to grasp the changes or evolutions of that situation over time. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community: A DialecticContext (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As statedbefore,activitiesaresociallyand contextuallybound. So, any activitysystem can be described only in the contextof the community inwhich itoperates(seeFigure I).The communitynegotiatesand mediatestherulesand customs that describe how the community functions,what itbelieves,and theways thatit supportsdifferentactivities (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;any activity can only be understood by analyzing its historical development. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activitytheory focuses on the centrality of activity in a cultural theory of cognition. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ToolMediation (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity always involves artifacts (instruments, signs, procedures, machines, methods, laws, and forms of work organization). While cognitive psychology traditionally has focused only on mental representations, ignoring artifacts or mediating tools and signs, &amp;ldquo;activity cannot be understood without understanding the role of artifacts in everyday existence, especially the way that artifacts are integrated into social practice&amp;rdquo; (Nardi, 1996, p. 14). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tools mediate or alter the nature of human activity and, when internalized, influence humans&amp;rsquo; mental development. Kaptelinen argues that all &amp;ldquo;human experience is shaped by the tools and sign systems we use&amp;rdquo; (1996, p. 10). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &amp;ldquo;the human individual&amp;rsquo;s activity is a system of social relations. It does not exist without those social relations&amp;rdquo; (Leont&amp;rsquo;ev, 1981, pp. 46-7). Individuals involved in a particular activity are simultaneously members of other activity groups which have different objects, tools, and social relations. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &amp;ldquo;horizontaIness&amp;rdquo; in activity-theory dynamics. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to horizontal activity systems, there are dynamics that underlie (&amp;ldquo;verticalness&amp;rdquo;) any activity (see Figu~ 3). Each component of an activity is the result of other activities which produced it. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very little, if any, meaningful activity is accomplished individually. People may perform individually in contexts such as school, but their ability to perform is predicated on groups of people. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engestr6m (1987), (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nested&lt;br /&gt;
 this is very interesting. mapping KB principles onto these mini-activities will be interesting. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Ke2008-hw&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ke, F. (2008). A case study of computer gaming for math: Engaged learning from gameplay? Computers &amp;amp; Education, 51(4), 1609–1620. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2008.03.003&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2008.03.003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the key question remains misty: Do computer games really foster an engaging, effective learning experience in classrooms? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a few current researchers shy away from drill and practice games and have claimed them as not equally effective in improving learning and skills in comparison to other game genres. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the current study investigated the application of drill and practice computer games in a summer school math program, by focusing on these research questions: (1) How did students interact with computer math games and game- based learning environment? (2) Did math game-playing improve students’ math learning outcomes? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;although the study adopted qualitative case study as the dominant paradigm in order to investigate a contemporary phenomenon – game-based learning – within its real-life context (Yin, 1984, p. 23), where possible, quantitative procedures were employed in the method of this study to corroborate and extend the primarily qualitative approach. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the open and the ending session, participants could choose to play whatever math games (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the remained sessions they were required to play the games that was assigned to them. It was arranged that in each session participants played a different math game. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Study participants Fifteen 4th–5th grade students were enrolled in the summer math program and participated in this research project. They were 10–13 years old, with five being socio-economic disadvantaged, 10 being girls, and all being white.2 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Games and instruments (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASTRA EAGLE, comprising a series of web-based games developed by the Center for Advanced Technologies of the sam- pled school district, was used in this study. The games were designed to reinforce academic standards for mathematics re- quired by Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, the evaluation of games’ outcomes in this study should be a comprehensive measurement of cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational aspects. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 30-item ‘‘Game Skills Arithmetic Test (GSAT)” was constructed based on the PSSA. It measured cognitive math skills (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inventory on attitudes toward the subject matter was a modification of Tapia’s ‘‘Attitudes Towards Math Inventory” (ATMI, Tapia &amp;amp; Marsh, 2004). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metacognitive skill was measured by the Junior Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (Jr. MAI) Version A (Sperling, How- ard, Miller, &amp;amp; Murphy 2002). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4. Data collection and analysis (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observation: The researcher closely observed participants’ behaviors, verbal and nonverbal, and facial expressions when they interacted with the computer program, peers, and the external environment. A semi-structured observation protocol was developed to guide the researcher’s attention during observation, though the actual observation was open to any situ- ational changes. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think-aloud: Based on Ericsson and Simon’s (1993) talk-aloud method, the researcher developed an open-ended protocol to facilitate participant thinking but not influence what they said. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document analysis: the computer game program recorded participants’ on-task time (the time when they logged-in the games), the numbers of math questions they had tried to solve, the questions they had solved correctly, and the gaming scores they earned. These records were collected every week and coded. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative Data analysis: By following Yin’s (1984) proposition on the case study method, the researcher first did within- case analysis to identify unique patterns within the data for the single case (participant), and then conducted cross-case the- matic analysis to categorize the similarities and differences across the participants in responses and activities, with the goal of finding the recurring themes and organizing the data into systematic categories of analysis. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statements or meaning units that emerged as possible commonalities from the data were forwarded as initial themes (Creswell, 1998) (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researcher then refined these themes by removing overlapping ones and capturing the main thrust of each theme’s meaning (Guba &amp;amp; Lincoln, 1994). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.5. Researcher’s position (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Creswell (1998) pointed out, the problem of participant observation in qualitative inquiry was that the researcher’s pre-understandings predisposed her to interpret the nature of the phenome- non. To bracket these predispositions, the researcher was explicit here. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;less than completely comfortable with using computer games as a stand-alone instructional tool in the classroom. These tendencies certainly impact the data analysis and the resulting findings as they are part of the lens brought to the study. However, it is important to understand that these feelings did not remain unbracketed, but rather were part of the inter- pretation of the findings that emerged. Additionally, the researcher applied member checks – involving the participants in the inspection and rectification of transcribed think-aloud and observation data (Guba &amp;amp; Lincoln, 1994). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Findings and discussion (p. 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. Quantitative results (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there was no credible evidence suggesting that computer gaming facilitated students’ achievements in cognitive math skills or metacognitive awareness. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there was a significant difference between par- ticipants’pretestandposttest scoresinATMIattitudesmeasure, F(1,14) = 5.34,p = .04.Henceit can beconcludedthatstudents developed significantly more positive attitudes toward math learning through the math gaming treatment. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there may be a ceiling effect: in the measurement of metacognitive awareness before the treatment, the average group mean for self-reported inventory score was 29.3 (out of 36), which made it difficult to further improve the metacognitive score through a five-week treatment. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. Qualitative results (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four general patterns on participants’ experiences in game-based learning environment emerged through within-case and cross-case thematic analysis. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2.1. Learning outside of the gameplay versus learning within the gameplay (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as time passed by, quite a few participants reported being disappointed and bored: (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to these participants, a learning game’s engagement power would be spoiled if in this game students were asked to ‘‘step out of the game world” to do math learning (Van Eck, 2006, p. 22). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This observation explains why most educational gaming researchers recommend learning by stealth, that is learning can only be engaging when it is concealed within games and thus unconscious to the learners, when it is integral to the story of game world, and when it is designed as authentic activities associated with a virtual identity or character (Gee, 2003; Prensky, 2001). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2.1.1. Wandering mouse – Random clicking. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2.1.2. Learning situated within the gameplay. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also observed that participants tended to perform effortful game-based learning activities when they considered a challenge as within their regime of competence (Gee, 2003), or high-stake for accomplishing the game goal (e.g. solving this problem would decide whether they can pass a game level or not). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2.2. Gaming without reflection (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, very few participants reflected on their performance to gain lessons for future problem solving. They only attended to their feelings, by expressing happiness or disappointment with a success or failure, then moving on straight away. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2.3. Play-based communication (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;collective game-playing facilitated peer communication. Over all of the two-hour gaming sessions, game players were very active in exchanging game scores, expressing feelings about the games, and in certain cases, doing social talk that was irrelevant to the learning tasks. However, these peer communications were mostly play-based rather than learning-oriented. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2.4. Offline learning tools (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;participants used offline tools to assist online-game-based problem solving. Generally there were two formats of offline learning tool: technical tools such as pencil with paper or a calculator, and instructor’s scaffolding. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusions and implications (p. 10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusively, this study informed that computer math drill games, even through being more simplistic than commercial role-playing games in terms of visual, activity, and interaction design, still significantly enhance students’ positive attitudes toward math learning. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it should be noted that not every computer math drill game would engage children in committed learning. The observation and participants’ thinking aloud protocols have generally supported the propositions of gaming researchers (Garris et al., 2002; Gee, 2003; Van Eck, 2006) on good learning game design principles, such as situating learning activities within the game story and characters that players will take on, making games pleasantly challenging, and scaffolding reflec- tions. In addition, the study findings also highlight the value of designing suitable off-computer activities that will enhance the game-based learning process, such as the usage of offline assistive learning tools, game-based collaborative activities, and the just-in-time guidance of an instructor. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Kennedy2016-qw&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meegan Kennedy (2016): Open Annotation and Close Readingthe Victorian Text: Using Hypothes.is with Students, Journal of Victorian Culture, DOI:10.&lt;sup&gt;1080&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;13555502&lt;/sub&gt;.2016.1233905&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This commentary introduces an instructor&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and experiences in integrating Hyphthes.is, an open annotation tool, into an undergrad course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;: Thorough intro to all kinds of considerations that would inform another instructor&amp;rsquo;s design efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m planning on using H in my SNA class, so this piece is very helpful. Building on the issue with lack of connection with a traditional LMS/CMS, I am considering combining Slack + Hypothes.is (on course text book and web pages) + an open textbook authored by me (mostly weekly orientation and curation) to form the backbone of this class. Open annotation will be the thread to weave things (ideas in readings, my open textbook, anything students find interesting) together. Slack will facilitate class communication. Slack offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://hypothes.is/blog/using-atom-feeds-to-receive-hypothesis-notifications-in-slack/&#34;&gt;a way to subscribe to H annotations&lt;/a&gt;. Slack also offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248&#34;&gt;data exports&lt;/a&gt; that would work for student practice in my SNA class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many students write critical essays without quoting a word from the primary text; others quote passages and hastily move on without considering the text they have just offered or discussing why it might be relevant. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we coach stu- dents to train their attention on the text, on the unique force of a particular phrase or moment, before broadening their perspective to wider horizons? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay’s commentary on open annotation in the classroom grows out of the particular challenges and rewards of the course where it was used. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered a number of annotation tools. After trying many and consulting with colleagues and the distance learning team at FSU,3 I chose Hypothes.is.4 It offered sta- bility, good reviews, open source, creative commons, the option of private annotation, a clean and inviting interface, and flexible possibilities for the course and beyond. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assignments (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Literature and Medicine: Diseases and Debates, Then and Now’ included six opportu- nities for annotation, all of which were structured as individual contributions to a group discussion of Victorian primary source texts. In one assignment, the students group-an- notated an e-text of George Eliot’s novella The Lifted Veil, an assigned text, which had been discussed in other course materials (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annotation in Hypothes.is requires students to attach their response to a specific element in the text. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assignment replicated the kind of class discussion we might have had in a face-to-face course. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In browsing the highlighted text, the reader can also quickly identify ‘hot spots’ where more interesting or controversial material occurs. Because I required students to respond to two other annotations as well as posting their own, clusters of postings quickly built up, signalling knotty textual moments and inviting students to pause and read more closely. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this course, I simply required students to post literary, historical, or ethical anno- tations, sometimes guiding them with a broad prompt. Using Hypothes.is on Victorian texts lends itself to focused annotation along a number of axes: (1) Historical: highlight a literary, medical, judicial, or historical reference and dis- cuss its history; (2) Linguistic: highlight one word and discuss its history, usage, and connotations; (3) Literary: highlight a phrase or sentence to discuss using particular literary or analytic concepts discussed in class (metaphor, free indirect discourse, irony, etc); (4) Ethical: highlight a sentence that represents an ethical choice in this text and discuss the costs of that choice; (5) Multimedia: highlight a phrase or sentence and link to a visual, audio, or video clip with a brief explanation of the connection you see. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues and resolutions Jeremy Boggs has noted three roles for instructors using technology in the classroom: role model; tech support; and cheerleader.12 (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students’ two major problems were not technological but practical. First, they posted to the wrong websites. The advantage Hypothes.is offers in being able to attach to nearly any website becomes a disadvantage when students simply performed a Google search for The Lifted Veil (for example) and annotated whatever they found, rather than fol- lowing my posted link to a specific version of the story. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, students annotated the correct website but in the ‘public’ channel rather than in our private, class channel (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothes.is allows easy shifting between public and private annotation. I needed to ensure students’ anonymity online because FSU’s Office of Distance Learning was con- cerned about FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) violations. There are good reasons to reconsider the assumption that all student work must be submitted pri- vately and/or anonymously in order to comply with FERPA. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;finally, due to the sensitive nature of the course material, I worked to establish trust and community so that we could respectfully disagree upon difficult matters. I strove to mitigate the ethical dilemmas of open annotation in the curated space of my classroom, but they remain in the larger context of the web. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some websites do not integrate smoothly with the Hypothes.is shell. Hypothes.is is designed to work with PDFs, but page frames and embedded readers as in Googlebooks and Gutenberg still caused us difficulties. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student experiences (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They specifically mentioned its key features: anchoring commentary to specific moments in the text and facilitating replies to those annotations (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also described the experience as ‘inventive’, ‘interactive’, and ‘thoughtful’. Six students explicitly preferred Hypothes.is to the context-free comments permitted in Blackboard’s Discussion Board. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirteen students acknowledged some difficulty in learning how to use the tool. They requested a more deliberate introduction to Hypothes.is and mentioned site-navigation issues, which are being fixed. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some students felt disoriented because the Hypothes.is tool was not explicitly within the CMS. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a large class, some responsibility must fall on the student to follow directions and ask for help. However, since students working in haste may not follow instructions to the letter, some may have difficulty with the first Hypothes.is assignments. I recommend a deliberate, staged introduction to the tool to ensure that students do not go astray. If (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My students’ literary analyses were indisputably enriched by Hypothes.is. It facilitated easy online interaction with a variety of texts and each other, and it required students to anchor their comments rigorously in specific textual passages. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conference speakers could choose to post their talks so that conference participants could register responses and continue the discussions started in live panels; or so that scholars who did not attend could partic- ipate. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, Hypothes.is will continue to work with organizations and sites large and small – like the HathiTrust, Project Gutenberg, Google Books, and the Dickens Journal Project – to ensure seamless use of open annotation on the texts they make available. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students who reported carrying weapons to school reported less overall or total perceived social support than did their peers who did not carry weapons. In addition, the former reported significantly less perceived social support from all sources—parents, teachers, classmates, close friends, and the school. Another finding was that in addition to other commonly cited and researched risk factors (e.g., drug use, alcohol use), individual social support from parents, teachers, classmates, and close friends also was a significant predictor of weapon carrying in school. (p. 169)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RISK FACTORS (p. 170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violence (p. 170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;providing more evidence that adult support is negatively related to violent behavior. (p. 170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these common characteristics have been identified, a clear “profile” of a student who may become lethally violent in school does not exist. Rather, researchers have identified an interaction among many factors. (p. 170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three studies thus suggest that higher peer support is related to higher rates of violence, whereas lower peer support is related to higher rates of being victimized. (p. 170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• individualfactors(e.g.,bringing weapons to school, discipline problems, aggressive behavior); • familyfactors(e.g.,lackoffamily support); • schoolorpeerfactors(e.g.,gang membership, being bullied at school, low peer support); • societalfactors(e.g.,accessto weapons); and • situational factors (e.g., stressful events; Verlinden et al., 2000). (p. 170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;few empirical studies have specifically examined the relationships among social support variables and school violence or weapons possession. (p. 170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, social support was defined as an individual’s perceptions of general support or specific supportive behaviors from people in his or her social network, which enhances the person’s functioning and/or may buffer him or her from adverse out- (p. 170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons Carrying in Schools (p. 170)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comes (Malecki &amp;amp; Demaray, 2002). We measured social support with The Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale– Revised Edition (CASSS; Malecki, Demaray, &amp;amp; Elliott, 2000), which was developed using Tardy’s (1985) model of social support (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tardy described several elements in measuring social support, including whether support is available or actually enacted, whether support is described (frequency) or evaluated (importance of support perceived), and whether support is given or received. In addition, Tardy noted that there are several types of social support (emotional, informational, instrumental, and appraisal ) and that support comes from many sources. (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materials (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TheCASSS. Thisinstrumentassesses perceived social support via students’ selfreports of support from five sources: parents, teachers, classmates, a close friend, and the school. Four types of support (emotional, informational, instrumental, and appraisal) within each source of support are assessed. Thus, three items for each of the four types of support make up each of the source subscales (12 items for each subscale), resulting in 60 total items. (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH PREDICTIONS (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METHOD (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each item is rated by students on the perceived frequency of a supportive behavior (1 = Never to 6 = Always) and on the importance that they attribute to that behavior (1 = Not Important to 3 = Very Important ). (p. 171)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health Questionnaire. The questions used in the current study were taken from a larger questionnaire originally developed by an outside community agency. (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk Code. Twelve of the questions on the survey were summed to create a risk code. These 12 items addressed bullying, being bullied, delinquent behavior, and drug and alcohol use. (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three questions regarding bullying asked “How often have you done these things to someone else at school in the last year?” and included “attacked someone,” “threatened someone with a weapon,” and “used a weapon to hurt someone.” Responders rated each item on a 5-point scale (0 = Never, 1 = 1 to2times,2=3to5times,3=6to9times, and 4 = 10+ times). (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 14 items from the questionnaire were used in the current study (3 to assess weapons possession and 12 to develop a “risk code” score) and are described next. (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons Possession. (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal consistency of the frequency scores has been demonstrated with an alpha coefficient of .97 for the overall support score (n = 192) and strong coefficients on the subscales (rs = .92–.95; ns = 193–263). Test–retest reliability evidence has been demonstrated for the frequency scores with 8to 10-week coefficients of .85 on the overall support score and .47 to .83 on the subscales (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students were classified as having carried a weapon to school by analyzing the following three items from the health questionnaire: 1. “How many times in the last year have you carried a knife to school?” 2. “How many times in the last year have you carried a gun to school?” 3. “How many times in the last year have you carried another weapon to school?” (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to assessing drug and alcohol use, students were asked “How many times in the last year have you been drunk or high at school?” and “How many times in the last 30 days did you use marijuana?” (p. 172)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESULTS (p. 173)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary Analyses (p. 173)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descriptive statistics were compiled on the number of students in the sample who reported carrying a knife, gun, or other weapon to school in the last year (see Table 2). Descriptive statistics for the 42 students who reported carrying a weapon to school at least once are presented in Table 3. (p. 173)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to investigate gender and grade differences in the main variable of interest, carrying a weapon to school, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on weapons-carrying status (0 = have not carried a weapon, 1 = carried a weapon at least once) by gender and grade (sixth, seventh, and eighth). Results indicated a main effect for gender, F(1, 446) = 13.77, p &amp;lt; .001, with girls (M = .05, SD = .21) reporting less carrying of weapons than boys (M = .14, SD = .35), and a main effect for grade level (p. 173)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post hoc Sheffé analyses revealed that sixth graders (M = .04, SD = .19) reported carrying weapons less often than both seventh-grade students (M = .12, SD = .33) and eighth-grade students (M = .12, SD = .33). No significant gender by grade level interaction was found (p. 174)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Analyses (p. 174)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;conducting an ANOVA on the CASSS total support score by weapons-carrying status. Students who reported carrying weapons obtained significantly lower total support scores than students who did not report carrying weapons, F(1, 459) = 14.26, p &amp;lt; .001. (p. 174)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in Perceived Social Support. Means and standard deviations for social support scores by weaponscarrying status are reported in Table 4. (p. 174)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;conducting a MANOVA on the CASSS subscale scores by weaponscarrying status. The MANOVA was significant, Wilks’s lambda = .95, F(5, 455) = 4.96, p &amp;lt; .001. Results of followup univariate analyses indicated that students who self-reported carrying weapons scored lower on all subscales (Parent, Teacher, Classmate, Close Friend, and School) than did students who did not report carrying weapons. (p. 175)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PredictingWeaponCarriers. Alogistical regression analysis was conducted to investigate the predictive power of several risk factors, demographic variables, and social support in predicting weapons carriers. (p. 175)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logistical regression was significant, χ2(4, N = 461) = 65.53, p &amp;lt; .0001. See Tables 5 and 6 for results. (p. 175)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION (p. 175)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another finding was that in addition to other commonly cited and researched risk factors (e.g., drug use, alcohol use, victimization, bullying, delinquent behavior), overall social support from parents, teachers, classmates, and close friends is a significant individual predictor. (p. 176)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As predicted, students who reported carrying weapons to school reported less overall or total perceived social support than did their peers who did not carry weapons. In addition, they reported significantly less perceived social support from all sources: parents, teachers, classmates, close friends, and people in their school. (p. 176)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, researchers and practitioners should be aware that measuring students’ levels of perceived social support can significantly improve risk assessments concerning carrying a weapon to school. (p. 176)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current study provides empirical evidence that students who report carrying weapons to school also report significantly less perceived social support than their peers who do not carry weapons. (p. 176)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study has several limitations. First, as with the majority of the research in this area, all of the data were gathered via self-report from students. (p. 176)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core algorithm employs a novel combination of sequence mining techniques to identify di erentially frequent patterns between groups of students (e.g., experimental versus control conditions or high versus low performers). We extend this technique by contextualizing the sequence mining with information about the stu- dent&amp;rsquo;s performance over the course of the learning interactions. Speci cally, we employ a piecewise linear segmentation algorithm in concert with the di erential sequence mining technique to iden- tify and compare segments of students&amp;rsquo; productive and unproductive learning behaviors (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive scientists have established that metacognition and self-regulation are important components for developing e ective learning in the classroom and be- yond [Bransford et al. 2000; Zimmerman 2001]. In developing a computer-based learning environment (CBLE) called Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain, we adopt the framework for self-regulated learning (SRL), which originated from the social constructive theory of learning proposed by Bandura [1997]. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe choice-rich, open- ended learning environments like Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain, where students have to work on complex learning tasks can provide these much-needed opportunities to learn and practice these skills in classroom environments. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous work, we have used hidden Markov models (HMMs) [Rabiner 1989] as a direct (probabilistic) representation of these internal states and strategies. This methodology has facilitated identi cation, interpretation, and comparison of student learning behaviors at an aggregate level [Biswas et al. 2010; Kinnebrew et al. 2013]. Like a student&amp;rsquo;s mental processes, the states of an HMM are hidden, meaning that they cannot be directly observed, but they produce observable output (e.g., actions in a learning environment). However, the aggregated descriptions often mask the exact manifestation of speci c learning behaviors and strategies that students employ as they work on the system. To identify and analyze these detailed learning behaviors, we have developed sequence mining methods that provide a ner-grained analysis and more precise de nitions of learning behavior di erences between groups of students. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sequential pattern mining [Agrawal and Srikant 1995 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this approach can also result in a very large number of frequent patterns, especially when allowing gaps to ac- count for \noise.&amp;rdquo; For example, when we looked at activity traces of 22 8th grade students working on a climate change science unit in Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain, we found over 1,000 patterns that occurred in at least 80% of their interaction traces on the sys- tem, even when we limited gaps to a single action between consecutive actions in the pattern. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, a major challenge in the analysis of frequent patterns is limiting the often large set of results to interesting or important patterns (i.e., the effectiveness of a mining technique in identifying useful patterns as opposed to its efficiency, or speed, in finding the patterns [Agrawal et al. 1993]). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To overcome this problem, we have developed an algorithm that employs a novel combination of sequence mining techniques to identify di erentially frequent pat- terns between groups of students (e.g., experimental versus control conditions or high versus low performers) [Kinnebrew and Biswas 2011]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RELATED PRIOR WORK (p. 4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1 Identifying and Measuring Metacognition and Self-Regulated Learning (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach to measuring students&amp;rsquo; metacognition and self-regulated learning (SRL) has been through the use of self-report questionnaires (e.g., [Pin- trich et al. 1993; Weinstein et al. 1987; Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons 1986]). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, researchers have begun to utilize trace methodologies in order to examine the complex temporal patterns of self-regulated learning [&lt;strong&gt;Aleven et al. 2006; Azevedo and Witherspoon 2009; 2009; Biswas et al. 2010; Hadwin et al. 2007; Jeong and Biswas 2008; Zimmerman 2008&lt;/strong&gt;]. The primary notion is that metacog- nition and SRL are evolving events that can be better understood by observing students&amp;rsquo; learning and problem-solving activities. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Hadwin et al. [2007] performed a study that collected activity traces of 8 students using the gStudy system [Perry and Winne 2006]. The activity traces were analyzed in four di erent ways: (i) frequency of studying events, (ii) patterns of studying activity, (iii) timing and sequencing of events, and (iv) content analyses of students&amp;rsquo; notes and summaries. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perry &amp;amp; Winne, 2006 (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, trace data is being supplemented with other sources of data, such as concurrent verbal think-alouds (e.g., [Azevedo and Witherspoon 2009] and mea- sures of a ect (e.g., automatic recording of facial expression, posture, etc. [Burleson et al. 2004; D&amp;rsquo;Mello et al. 2007; D&amp;rsquo;Mello et al. 2008; Lester et al. 1997]. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2 Applying Sequence Mining to Study Student Learning Behaviors (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perera et al. [2009] investigate trace data from mirroring and feedback tools that support e ective teamwork among students collaborating on software development using an open source professional development environment called TRAC. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martinez et al. [2011] discover which frequent sequences of actions char- acterize high-achieving and low-achieving learners. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Perera et al. [2009] and Martinez et al. [2011], we compare sequential pat- terns derived from groups of student activity sequences. However, our di eren- tial sequence mining algorithm directly incorporates comparisons between groups in identifying interesting patterns, rather than manually performing researcher- directed comparisons after data mining. Further, in addition to sequential pattern mining metrics and constraints, we employ additional metrics, such as another frequency calculation based on episode mining, to identify di erentially frequent patterns. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other researchers have employed sequential pattern mining (with a single set of student activity sequences or subsequences) to generate student models for cus- tomizing learning to individual students. For example, Tang and McCalla [2002] propose sequential pattern mining of students&amp;rsquo; paths in a web-based environment, followed by a clustering step, to build better student models. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have also employed sequence mining with the goal of identify- ing learning behaviors relevant to self-regulated learning. In particular, Nesbit et al. [2007] employ sequential pattern mining to investigate self-regulation in gStudy (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors de ne a set of actions from events in log les and use sequential pattern mining to nd the longest common subsequences across a set of action les. Using this method, the authors hope to step beyond the question of whether a tool helps learners construct knowledge and instead in- vestigate when and how learners use the tool as they self-regulate their knowledge construction activities. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DIFFERENTIAL SEQUENCE MINING METHODOLOGY (p. 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Action Abstraction with Context Summarization (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action abstraction is the rst step of our data mining methodology, in which researcher-identi ed categories of actions de ne an initial alphabet (set of action symbols) for the sequences. This step lters out irrelevant information (e.g., cur- sor position) and combines qualitatively similar actions (e.g., querying an agent through di erent interfaces or about di erent concepts in a given topic). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A form of feature engineering? (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, log events are mapped to a sequence of canonical actions (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o maintain a balance between minimizing the number of distinct actions in the sequences and keeping potentially important context information, we determine whether the content/object of an action is the same as the content/object of any other action in a small, con gurable window of previous actions. Based on this relevance summarization we split each categorized action into two distinct actions: (1) relevant (with the -REL&amp;rdquo; suffix) and (2) irrelevant (with the -IRR&amp;rdquo; suffix) to recent actions [Biswas et al. 2010]. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve this exploratory analysis, our action abstraction step distin- guishes a single action from repeated actions (with a given threshold on the number of repeats), which are condensed to a single \action&amp;rdquo; with the -MULT&amp;rdquo; identi er. Using the re-transformed sequences, our di erential sequence mining technique can more efficiently identify trends that could otherwise be hidden by the multitude of frequent patterns di ering only by the length of a repeated action sequence [Kin- nebrew and Biswas 2011]. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2 Di erential Sequence Mining (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;our methodology employs a novel combination of sequence mining techniques. In particular, sequential pattern mining [Agrawal and Srikant 1995] is used to determine the most frequent action patterns across a set of action se- quences, while episode mining [Mannila et al. 1997] metrics are used to nd the most frequently used action patterns within a given sequence.&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequential pattern mining frequency measure, which is important for identifying patterns common to a group of action sequences, is de ned as: the number of sequences in which the pattern occurs (regardless of how frequently it occurs). We refer to this frequency measure as the sequence support (or s-support) of the pattern, following the convention of Lo et al. [2008], and we call patterns meeting a given s-support threshold, s-frequent. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important metric for comparing patterns across groups is the episode frequency, which is de ned (for a single sequence) as: the number of times the pattern occurs, without overlap, in a sequence. For a given sequence, we refer to this frequency measure as the instance support (or i-support), following Lo et al. [2008]. We de ne the i-support of a pattern for a group of sequences as: the mean of the pattern&amp;rsquo;s i-support values across all sequences in the group. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algorithm 1 de nes our di erential sequence mining technique, which combines the group s-support and i-support frequency measures to identify di erentially fre- quent patterns across two groups of action sequences (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, we employ a sequential pattern mining algorithm that allows regular ex- pression constraints (the regex parameter) on the matched patterns. Speci cally, we use the core algorithm (SPAMc) from Pex-SPAM [Ho et al. 2005], which extends the fast SPAM algorithm [Ayres et al. 2002] with gap and regular expression con- straints. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to identify patterns whose usage more clearly di er between the two groups, we lter the s-frequent patterns based on the p value of a t-test comparing pattern i-support between the groups (in line 6). Although this approach relies on multiple comparisons by the t-test statistic between the groups, the t-test is not used to prove that the two groups of sequences di er. Rather, it is employed as a heuristic for identifying more interesting patterns in an exploratory analysis. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3 Performance Evolution Phase Identi cation (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many CBLEs, such as the Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain environment described in Section 4, a student&amp;rsquo;s work can be assessed in terms of performance on a learning or problem-solving task. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Di erent patterns of performance evolution may be important in situating learning behaviors with respect to the student&amp;rsquo;s cognitive and metacognitive activities. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify these performance phases, we employ a bottom-up, time-series linear segmentation algorithm [Keogh et al. 2004]. This method begins with the nest- grained PLR in which each pair of consecutive points is a separate segment. At each step every pair of consecutive segments is considered for merging into a new segment, and the pair with the lowest error metric (for the merged segment) is merged. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n our technique, we employ a standard linear regression to generate each segment and use sum-squared-error (SSE) as the error metric. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our complete methodology consists of four major steps to compare learning be- haviors between productive phases of performance and counter-productive phases for a set of students: (1) Action abstraction: Log les are processed to produce a sequence of actions for each student by mapping sets of interaction events to canonical actions. Each canonical action is split into high (-REL&amp;rdquo; suffix) and low (-IRR&amp;rdquo; suffix) relevance types based on its content relation to recent, previous actions. Finally, any subsequences of a repeated action are condensed into a single repeated action (-MULT&amp;rdquo; suffix). (2) Performance phase identi cation: Student action sequences are split into sub- sequences using the time-series segmentation algorithm. These subsequences are ltered to produce two sequential datasets: a) productive action sequences corresponding to segments with a positive progress slope above a given cuto , and b) counter-productive action sequences corresponding to segments with a negative progress slope below a given (negative) cuto . (3) Di erential sequence mining: The productive and counter-productive datasets are compared to identify di erentially frequent sequential patterns of action. (4) Interpretation: The di erentially frequent sequential patterns of action are in- terpreted in terms of e ective and ine ective learning behaviors exhibited by students during the learning task. Investigation of pattern details (i.e., raw event details for instances of these patterns) may yield further insights into student cognition and metacognition, as well as potential ags and triggers for adaptive feedback/sca olding in the system. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cognitive and metacognitive activity model captures the complexity of the Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain task, and also highlights the wide array of cognitive tasks that stu- dents should attend to as they are both constructing and monitoring their under- standing of the science domain. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;METHODS (p. 19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze the interaction traces from this study, we abstract student activities into actions in ve categories: (1) READ: students access one of the pages in the resources; (2) Editing: students edit the causal map, with actions further divided by whether they operated on a causal link (\LINK&amp;rdquo;) or concept (\CONC&amp;rdquo;) and by whether the action was an addition (\ADD&amp;rdquo;), removal (\REM&amp;rdquo;), or modi cation (\CHG&amp;rdquo;), e.g., LINKREM or CONCADD; (3) QUER: students use a template, illustrated in Figure 2, to check their teaching by querying Betty, and she answers using causal reasoning through chains of links [Leelawong and Biswas 2008]; (4) EXPL: students probe Betty&amp;rsquo;s reasoning by asking her to explain her answer to a query, which she does through a demonstration of her causal reasoning process with dialogue and animation on the causal map; (5) QUIZ: students assess how well they have taught Betty by having her take a quiz, which is a set of questions chosen and graded by the Mentor agent. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Categorized student actions were further distinguished by their relevance to re- cent actions, as explained in Section 3.1. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step is key &amp;ndash; feature engineering to decide relevancy.  (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this analysis, an action was considered relevant (-REL&amp;rdquo;) if it was related to at least one of the previous actions within a 3-action window, and irrelevant (-IRR&amp;rdquo;) otherwise. For Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain, a prior action is considered relevant to the current action if it is related to, or operates on, one of the same map links (or one of the same con- cepts if one of the actions being compared only relates to a single concept). This relevance summarization provides an indication of informedness for map build- ing/re nement actions and of diagnosticity for map monitoring activities [Biswas et al. 2010]. Overall, the relevance summarization maintains some action context by providing a rough measure of strategy focus or consistency over a sequence of actions. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESULTS (p. 20)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16 of the students taught their agent a correct, com- plete map or one very close to it (these students achieved map scores between 11 and 15, inclusive, where 15 was the maximum possible score). Another 18 students taught their agents relatively poor maps with a map score of 5 or below. Only 6 students had a map score in between these groups (i.e., a map score of 6 to 10, inclusive). Therefore, we focus on an analysis and comparison of the learning ac- tivities of the high-performing (\Hi&amp;rdquo;) student group and the low-performing (\Lo&amp;rdquo;) student group. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify and compare learning behaviors illustrated by these students&amp;rsquo; inter- action traces, we applied the di erential sequence mining technique described in Section 3.2 (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to identify a variety of interesting learning behaviors that were not apparent from separately considering s-frequent or i-frequent patterns. To illustrate these results, Table III presents the top ve patterns (that contained at least two actions) in each of the di erential categories detailed in Section 3.2. In this analysis, we employed an s-support threshold of 50% to analyze patterns that were evident in the majority of either group of students and employed a cuto of p &amp;lt; 0:05 for a reasonable con - dence that pattern usage di ered between the two groups. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hi group&amp;rsquo;s di erentially frequent patterns in Table III suggest a greater tendency to check low-relevance additions of causal links (possibly links added based on prior knowledge or guesses) by taking quizzes or by reading relevant resources, as described in the progress-monitoring strategies in Section 4.2. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain further insight into the most productive learning behaviors exhibited by the students in the Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain environment, we employed the di erential sequence mining technique to identify patterns di erentiating the productive sub- sequences of the Hi and Lo groups. Speci cally, all subsequences corresponding to productive segments in the Hi group were compared with all subsequences cor- responding to productive segments in the Lo group, with the results presented in Table V. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rough-summary&#34;&gt;Rough summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to know KBDeX two years ago. This paper is very helpful for understanding the power of this tool to support assessment for knowledge creation. Before reading it, I was thinking of KBDeX as just another analytic tool. I like the way the authors are situating this tool&amp;mdash;need for assessment for knowledge creation. I also like the way they explain this tool&amp;mdash;a combination of SNA and concept mapping, to bring social networks of people and semantic network of knowledge together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool is carefully designed and has a lot of potential. For future development, as the authors say, I wish to see more indicators tested in further empirical studies. Personally, I think it will be interesting to do some step-wise analysis and use changes of SNA measures brought about by each single discourse unit to model the &amp;ldquo;power&amp;rdquo; of each discourse unit, and further find ways to identify powerful discourse moves in knowledge creation. Will be fun to play with this idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clippings&#34;&gt;Clippings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Necessity of New Assessment Approaches in Knowledge-Creation Metaphor (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the acquisition metaphor, researchers are mainly concerned with what and how much knowledge is acquired by learners after learning experiences, and which activities are crucial to more profound knowledge acquisition (Sfard, 1998). Often these researchers use quantitative analysis based on systematic observation to assess learning (Mercer, 2005), and a typical assessment is conducted with a preand post-test design. By using a variety of methods, including paper-and-pencil tests, computerized tests, and presentations, learners’ understanding in specific domains before and after instruction is gauged to identify knowledge acquisition. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers who prefer the participation metaphor predominantly consider detailed case studies in assessments (Mercer, 2005) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are disadvantages in using these assessment techniques. In the knowledge-creation metaphor, researchers are not only concerned with learners’ comprehension of domain-specific knowledge but also with individuals’ contributions to community knowledge. The learners’ epistemic activities of utilizing their individual knowledge to improve their community knowledge cannot be analyzed by assessing static knowledge in a preand post-test design. Categorization of written or oral discourse during learning might be able to identify the epistemic activities, but such a coding scheme is content-free and what knowledge learners actually contribute cannot be examined. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNA as a Novel Assessment Approach in the Knowledge-Creation Metaphor (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as suggested by Mercer and colleagues (Mercer, 2005; Wegerif &amp;amp; Mercer, 1997), detailed description analysis of discourse can be impractical for large datasets because it is highly timeconsuming. Consequently, Wegerif and Mercer (1997) developed a methodology to combine detailed description analysis of discourse and computerized discourse analysis to handle large datasets. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, Concept Mapping Tools developed by Cañas et al. (2004) provides researchers with visualization of students’ semantic networks (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In educational research, the graphical approach to representing and evaluating learners’ knowledge structures in their minds has been examined for many years (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;discussions on the advantages of using SNA to investigate community knowledge advancement and individual learners’ engagement in this advancement from the perspective of the knowledgecreation metaphor (e.g., Martinez, Dimitriadis, Rubia, Gomez, &amp;amp; de la Fuente, 2003; Reffay, Teplovs, &amp;amp; Blondel, 2011; Reuven, Zippy, Gilad, &amp;amp; Aviva, 2003). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous work (Oshima, Oshima, Matsuzawa, van Aalst, &amp;amp; Chan, 2007), we further extended the potential of SNA as a core assessment technique by describing a different type of social network. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limited number of studies have used SNA, especially in the knowledgecreation metaphor. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we used a procedure similar to ordinary SNA, but proposed a different type of social network, one based on the words learners use in their discourse in a CSCL environment. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KBDeX: An Application of SNA of Discourse (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of network characteristics by using coefficients. During SNA, KBDeX calculates conventional network measures, such as the betweenness centrality coefficient, the degree centrality coefficient, and the closeness centrality coefficient (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of Discourse Data for SNA with KBDeX (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Inspection of Network of Words (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of Network Characteristics by Using Coefficients (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the visualization analysis, a notable difference was found in the cohesiveness of the network structure between the two groups. The final cumulative degree centrality was much higher for the Gillian group than for the Matt group. The following characteristics are seen in the transition of the cumulative degree centrality for the Gillian group: (a) after reaching a high value in the initial phase of their discourse, the cumulative degree centrality was sustained at a high level; and (b) there were no large fluctuations in the coefficients. Conversely, for the Matt group, it was found that (a) the cumulative degree centrality fell steeply in the final phase and (b) there were a number of large fluctuations in the coefficients. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepwise Analysis (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate each learner’s contribution to the group discourse, stepwise analyses were conducted. Figures 10 and 11 show averaged absolute differences of the centrality coefficients calculated for the network of words for each learner in the two groups. For the two groups, 3 (Learners) × 3 (Centralities) ANOVAs with the averaged absolute difference as the dependent variable showed that the averaged differences of the closeness and degree centrality coefficients for student A1 in the Gillian group were significantly higher than those for the two other students: F(2, 51) = 7.52, p &amp;lt; 0.01 and F(2, 51) = 8.01, p &amp;lt; 0.01, respectively; however, no significant differences were found for the Matt group. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, individual contributions to the network, which represent the state of the learners’ social knowledge, could be evaluated by breaking down the discourse datasets for each individual. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique contribution of SNA using KBDeX is the quantitative examination of each individual learner’s contribution to social knowledge advancement. Stepwise analyses revealed that one student in particular in the Gillian group played a cognitively important role that the two other students did not. This relationship between social knowledge advancement in a group and individual contributions has not been simultaneously examined in previous studies. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures used in SNA are appropriate for analysts to discuss network characteristics; however, they are not sufficient for educational researchers to examine learning in the knowledge-creation metaphor. The approach that we took in the establishment of indicators was to create a number of potential indicators based on one of the innovative models in the knowledge-creation metaphor (i.e., the knowledge building community), to apply these indicators to discourse (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to establish a unifying analytic framework in the knowledge-creation metaphor (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we have not sufficiently discussed alternative SNA-based measures (other than the centrality measure) that can be used to examine learning processes related to different metaphors of learning or different outcomes of learning. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we hope that discourse analysts can easily extend their analyses by integrating SNA of discourse data into their current approaches. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;datasets, and to compare the results with those in previously conducted in-depth analyses. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chan, C. K. K., Burtis, J., &amp;amp; Bereiter, C. (1997). Knowledge Building as a Mediator of Conflict in Conceptual Change. Cognition and Instruction (Vol. 15, pp. 1–40). doi:10.1207/s1532690xci1501_1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study examined how individuals and peers process scientific information that contradicts what they believe and assessed the contribution of this activity to conceptual change. Participants included 54 students in Grade 9 and 54 students in Grade 12, who were randomly assigned to four conditions: (a) individual conflict, (b) peer conflict, &amp;copy; individual assimilation, and (d) peer assimilation. Depending on the condition, students were asked to think aloud or discuss with their peers eight scientifically valid statements, which were presented in an order that either maximized or minimized the conflict between new information and existing beliefs. Pretest and posttest measures of prior knowledge and conceptual change were obtained, and student verbalizations were tape-recorded and coded for five levels of knowledge-processing activity. Two major approaches were identified from this analysis: direct assimilation, which involved fitting new information with what was already known, and knowledge building which involved treating new information as something problematic that needed to be explained. A path analysis indicated that the level of knowledge-processing activity exerted a direct effect on conceptual change and that this activity mediated the effect of conflict. Knowledge building as a mediator of conflict in conceptual change helps to explicate previous equivocal research findings and highlights the importance of students&amp;rsquo; constructive activity in learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clips&#34;&gt;Clips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major research  theme in instructionalpsychology emphasizes students&amp;rsquo;self-regulatory  strategyin their  own learning  (Bereiter  &amp;amp; Scardamalia,  1992; Glaser&amp;amp; Bassok, 1989; Resnick,  1989).  Theoretical  notions  such as surface-deep  (Biggs,1984), mindfulness  (Salomon &amp;amp; Globerson,  1987), explanation  (Bielaczyc  et al.,1995),  and intentional  learning  (Bereiter  &amp;amp; Scardamalia,  1989) have been used tocharacterize  the distinction  between a passive  versus  an active  approach  to learni (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tion is particularly  interestingin the context  of conceptual  change. Research inreading (Scardamalia  &amp;amp; Bereiter,  1984), writing  (Scardamalia  &amp;amp; Bereiter,  1987),and intentional  learning  (Bereiter  &amp;amp; Scardamalia,  1989; Chan, Burtis,  Scardamalia,&amp;amp; Bereiter,  1992) has shown the importance  of a problem-centered  approach tolearning.  Two contrasting  approaches  to understanding  new conceptsin unfamiliardomains have been identified:  Direct  assimilation  involves  fitting  new informationdirectly  into existing  knowledge,  whereas knowledge building  involves  learnerstreating  new conceptsas something  problematic  that they need to explain  (Bereiter&amp;amp; Scardamalia, (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;knowledge-building  approach would seem beneficial  for the learning  of difficultconcepts.  Instead  of directly  assimilating  new concepts,  students  employing  knowl(p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to examine how students  construct  scientific  under-standingwhen confronted  with information  that contradicts  what they believ (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second objective  was to assess  the efficacy  of conflictual  information  andto examine its relations  with a knowledge-building  approach  to learni (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the first  objective  was to identify  the kinds of knowledge-processingactivity  students  engagein when they are learning  from scientific  information  andto assess  the effects  of such activity  on conceptual  change (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edge-building  activity  are more likely  to delay immediate  interpretation,  to recog-nize the difficulties  of the new concepts,  and to avoid equating  ontologicallyincompatible  new concepts  with their  prior conception (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third objectivewas to investigate  the role of peer interaction  inconceptualchange by examining  how pairs of students  learn from incompatible  informati (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three research  questions  were addressed:  (a) Do the hypothesized  approaches  ofdirect  assimilation  and knowledge building  differentially  affect  conceptual  change?(b) Does conflict  lead to more conceptual  change, and are its effects  mediated byknowledge-processing  activity?  and &amp;copy; Does peer collaboration  foster  conceptualchange when students  are confronted  with contradictory  informati (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surface  Versus  Deep Feature (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;l:  A path analysis  showed thatknowledge-processing  activity,  as defined  by the scale,  exerted  a direct  effect  onconceptual  change and mediated  the effects  of confli (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings  are consistent  with the well-established  idea that experts  repre-sent problems at a deep level,  whereas novices  attend  only to the surface  features(Chi, Feltovich,  &amp;amp; Glaser,  1981) (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piecemeal  Editing  Versus  Delayed  Interpretatio (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though theyhad very inadequate  knowledge of thedomain, they were trying  to move in the direction  of formulating  problems at adeeper leve (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowl-edge-building  responses,  however, suggested  students&amp;rsquo;  concerns with a deeperproblem:the principle  of evolution  representedin the text and how it fits  with theirprior belie (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ly,  knowledge-building  responses  reflected  an active  stance  inidentifyingconflict  and attempts  to reconcile  the discrepancies.  Students  employing a knowl-edge-building  approach  do not avoid conflict  but use the contradictory  statementsas opportunities  for upgrading  their  domain understand (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fs.  The more expert  learners,  however,  recognized  that something  was differ-ent; hence, they were able to subject  their  knowledge to inquiry.  Just as theory-evi-dence coordination  isimportantin scientificexperimentation  (Klahr &amp;amp; Dunbar,1988; Kuhn, 1989), a problem-solving  process is required  for identifying  andresolving  the discrepancy  between new information  and domain understandi (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance  ofexplanationin science  learning  has been well documented (Bielaczyc  et al.,  1995;Chi, de Leeuw, et al., 1994 (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast  to usinga problem-minimization  approach,  the more expert  learners  attend  to deep princi-ples,  construct  coherence  from discordant  information,  seek out knowledge con(p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;s,  students  employinga knowledge-building  approach may benefit  more com-pared with those who provide  a one-shot  explanation  to eliminate  discrepant  factsthat do not fit their beliefs.  In viewing new information  as problematic  and asrequiring  explanations,  students  are engagedin an ongoing process of problemrecognition  and conflict  resolution.  Even ifthey have constructed  inaccurateexplanations,  they are more likely  to detect  anomalies  in upcoming information  andto revise  their  models continua (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patching  Versus  Explanation-Based  Inquiry (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theory-Evidence  Conflation  Versus  Problem  Recognit (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed,  focusing  on the multiplicityof relations  among pieces of information  (Brown &amp;amp; Day, 1983) and emphasizingcoherence  (Scardamalia  &amp;amp; Bereiter,  1984) are crucial  to meaning construct (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;flict,  and engage inexplanation-based (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinction  needs to be made between external  and internal  conflict:  Often,contradictory  information  is presented  in the hope that it will produce cognitiveconflict.  These results  seem to show that,  without knowledge-building  activity,confrontation  may not produce cognitive  conflict  but only assimilation  or externalcompetiti (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborative  Processing  of Contradictory  Informat (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. The path analysis  suggests  that conflict  may triggerknowledge-building  activity,  which then leads to conceptual  change, but thatconflict  in the absence of knowledge building  will not produce conceptual  change (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict  in itself  is not enough; it needs to be mediated by students&amp;rsquo;  knowledge-building  activity.  Viewing learning  as problematic  minimizes assimilation  an (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;leads to more conceptual  change (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT This paper explores the use of Knowledge Forum, a networked computer program designed to support knowledge building communication and to foster thinking and learning skills. The paper focuses on a Grade &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; classroom and looks at how students view scientic knowledge and what it means to learn science. A shift in pedagogy, along with the learning opportunities afforded by the communal database, impacted the learning environment and created changes in the structure of the learning activities, the ‘rules of the game’ of science and the sequencing of the curriculum. Specifically, the paper examines the knowledge transforming discourse that occurred both on and off the database as children worked to understand the evolution of the Komodo Dragon during an investigation of islands and island biogeography. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter (1989) point out: In the learned professions growth in knowledge is a requirement. Participants see themselves as contributors to knowledge, and as such they must continually monitor information for how it can advance their understanding and how they, in turn, can contribute to its advancement. The major challenge of schooling according to this view is to get students involved in the active pursuit of understanding and to see themselves as contributors to knowledge. (p. 10) (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We examine the ways in which the discourse of the classroom is supported through the use of Knowledge Forum, a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Cohen (1988) warns that the view of science knowledge as a fixed entity, as ‘factual, objective, and independent of human distortion’ is part of our scholastic inheritance. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting Pedagogy (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caswell’s idea of teaching science was to provide a number of attention-grabbing experiments and have students fill in worksheets in order to explain the phenomenon they had just witnessed. Science time also meant activity centers, where students moved from station to station (usually as quickly as they could), trying out expert-designed experiments, reading teacherselected resources, and filling in the checklist as each station was completed (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such ‘knowledge transforming discourse’ (Bereiter &amp;amp; Scardamalia, 1993) is central to knowledge building, and can be found in the interactions both offl ine and online in Knowledge Forum in the classroom we examine. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Forum as a Catalyst for Change (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect of Knowledge Forum critical to the shift in pedagogy is that it involves much more than software. It is a philosophy. The environment involves a new model of learning (Bereiter, in press) that Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter (1996a, b, 1999) call ‘Knowledge-Building Communities.’ (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, Caswell’s pedagogy has been evolving. This change can be characterized as a shift from activity centers to students forming research groups according to common interests; from teacher-designed experiments to student-designed experiments; from the gathering of resources by teacher only to collection by both teacher and students. The focus of classroom work and discussion revolves around trying to gain a deep understanding of a unit of study. Students work collaboratively and independently to gain understanding of materials, and to improve ideas. Their dialogue ranges from face-to-face whole group discussions, to small group research team meetings, to refl ective discourse within the database. The teacher’s goal is to create a classroom environment where genuine productive work can take place and where students are immersed in a culture of inquiry. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Shift in the Learning Environment Created in the Classroom (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classroom investigations discussed in this article were carried out in a Grade &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; classroom during the fall term (1999) at the Institute of Child Study, a laboratory school affiliated with the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. The daily participants included 22 students (9–11 years of age), a classroom teacher (Caswell), and a graduate student teacher candidate (Randall). Consultants included a teacher-researcher (Reeve) and a university researcher (Lamon). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Benchmark Lessons. A benchmark lesson is a teacher-led whole class activity designed to instigate conceptual change in students (diSessa &amp;amp; Minstrell, 1995). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also found that many of the participant structures for Fostering Communities of Learners (FCL), a classroom innovation focused on developing a community of inquiry (Brown &amp;amp; Campione, 1994, 1996), could be integrated with knowledge building pedagogy and the use of Knowledge Forum. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Crosstalk. A ‘crosstalk’ (Brown &amp;amp; Campione, 1996) is a democratic, whole class discussion where students present their emerging research ideas. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is amazing is that when, from the beginning of the school year, it is emphasized that everyone has ideas and ideas can always be improved, and science is a matter of discussing, testing and reworking these ideas, there is a kind of relief in the faces of the children. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Reciprocal Teaching Sessions. Reciprocal teaching is a reading comprehension technique developed by Brown &amp;amp; Palinscar (1989) that involves groups of students reading a particular resource, then questioning, summarizing and opportunistically clarifying and predicting. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the computer software is introduced (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, students sit on the carpet in a circle during that first science period and the teacher begins by saying that doing good science is all about working with ideas (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining the Curriculum Sequence: the progressive curriculum (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effects on Student Learning and Discourse: students’ use of Knowledge Forum for knowledge transforming discourse (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student inquiry around the evolution of the Komodo dragon actually moved the curriculum forward. In a knowledge-building classroom, ideally, the teacher carefully times and shapes interventions to respond to student interest while incorporating issues that the teacher knows are important to the subject matter and inquiry process. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimensions of Understanding (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They began to gather resources and to revisit the database in order to use information they had learned about species to put together a letter to the Environment Minister, pointing out reasons to reconsider the proposed Species at Risk Act. In our thinking, these Grade &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; students represent the kind of people Gardner craves: ‘human beings who understand the world, who gain sustenance from such understanding and who want—ardently, perennially—to alter it for the better’ (1999). (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the teacher witnesses in these settings is the multilayered learning that students are experiencing. On one level, you can see the content area being covered and students learning quite rapidly. On another level, you know that they are becoming prepared for a thinking life, the philosophical level which children are so natural at. At a third level, they are developing metacognitive skills which enable them to articulate thought processes and to highlight their needs as learners. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ideas about the nature of science (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the technical level of learning; everything about the use of the computer: graphics, keyboarding skills, etc. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the Komodo dragon discussion, students experienced first hand that scientific knowledge is not a fixed entity—their current state of knowledge is debated, theories are put forward, arguments are made and countered, etc. Through the discourse, their knowledge is critically examined and refined. These students are problematising not only science concepts, but the enterprise of science itself—they are focusing deeply on science-making. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributors to Knowledge (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collective Approach to Knowledge Building Students also experience a sense of the power in working collectively to advance ‘our’ understanding. No one student (or the teacher or other individual) is responsible for the understanding that developed about the evolution of the Komodo dragon. Different students contributed to the progress that was made. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students also come to see that their ideas are worth something, that they have views to contribute to the evolving overall understanding. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning science is no longer about learning the scientific facts that one is given, but rather, a new view of knowledge work begins to take root: science learning is about trying to resolve complex issues. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific Theory-making and Debate (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is noticeable for visitors to Caswell’s classroom is the students’ ability to articulate the ideas they are working with and what they find surprising or puzzling. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlying the importance of ideas as ‘improvable’ is the culture of the classroom that respects at all times the right of a person to state an idea and (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;::The next generation of CSILE, called Knowledge Forum®, provides a knowledge
building environment for communities (classrooms, service and health organizations,
businesses, and so forth) to carry on the sociocognitive practices described above—
practices that are constitutive of knowledgeand innovationcreating organizations.:: This
is a continuing challenge; Knowledge Forum undergoes continual revision as theory
advances and experience uncovers new problems and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although communities based on shared interests do develop in some
threaded discussion forums, this technology [threaded discussion] provides little means for a group to organize
its efforts around a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the database itself is an
emergent, representing at different stages in its development the advancing knowledge of
the community. ::From the users’ standpoint, the main constituents of a Knowledge Forum
database are notes and views. A view is an organizing background for notes. It may be a
concept map, a diagram, a scene—anything that visually adds structure and meaning to
the notes whose icons appear in it. Notes are contributed to views and may be moved
about to create organization within views. The same notes may appear in more than one
view.::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;::Knowledge Forum lends itself to a high level of what we call “epistemic agency”
(Scardamalia, 2000).::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;“New information,” “This theory explains,” and “This theory cannot explain.”&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;ation,” “This theory explains,” and “This theory cannot explain.”&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;::We designed Knowledge Forum not simply as a tool, but as a knowledge building
environment—that is, as a virtual space within which the main work of a knowledge
building group would take place (Scardamalia, 2003).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Forum is where the main work takes place. It is where
the “state of knowledge” materializes, takes shape, and advances. It is where the results
of the various off-line activities contribute to the overall effort. ::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @kress2009multimodality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kress, G. (2009). Multimodality: A social semiotic approach to contemporary communication. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: The highlights are from a book review rather than the book itself. Sounds like a worthwhile read. Getting the book soon&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing about multimodality requires defining “mode,” but this is notoriously difficult (cf. Forceville 2006, Elleström 2010). Kress advocates a dynamic view: “socially, what counts as mode is a matter for a community and its social representational needs. What a community decides to regard and use as mode is mode. &amp;hellip; Formally, what counts as mode is a matter of what a social-semiotic theory of mode requires a mode to be and to do” (p. 87 (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a practical solution, it makes “mode” applicable to any dimension of mediated meaningmaking. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kress’ concern with the freedom of the interpreter, and his (as such: correct) claim that the pictorial mode by and large enables more universal access than the verbal one leads to at least one untenable claim: “Saussure’s mistaken assumption that the relation of signifier and signified is an arbitrary one was, as is all theory, a product and realization of the social conditions of his time. &amp;hellip; In Social Semiotics arbitrariness is replaced by motivation, in all instances of sign-making, for any kind of sign” (p. 65, p. 67). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kress’ obsession with “freedom” (a symptom of having grown up in the sixties?) in my view also leads to an excessive inclination to link the intentions of a sign-maker to “relations of power” (p. 72). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the support of Lakoff and Johnson’s TIME IS SPACE metaphor (Lakoff and Johnson 1980: chapter 4), and McNeill’s thorough, empirically supported work on gestures, it is for instance possible to answer Kress’ question “can we indicate past time or future time in the mode of gesture?” (p. 107) with a clear “yes!” since in most cultures the future is in front of us, and the past behind us” – and this is perfectly expressible via gestures. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kress’ warning that the “sensory, affective and aesthetic dimension is too often ignored and treated as ancillary” (p. 78) in studies of communication is a pertinent one. Another good point: signal-makers have to select a mode, or a combination of modes, to bring across their message with the greatest chance of success, and this inevitably has consequences for the meaning that will or can be elicited. I also concur heartily with Kress stressing that “genre mediates between the social and the semiotic” (p. 116). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kucirkova, N., Sheehy, K., &amp;amp; Messer, D. (2015). A Vygotskian perspective on parent-child talk during iPad story sharing. Journal of Research in Reading, 38(4), 428–441. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1111&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1467&lt;/sub&gt;-9817.12030&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting study exploring themes of interactions in parent-child talk during iPad story sharing/creation. The analysis was largely informed by Vygotsky’s learning theory focusing on ZPD, dual representation and double stimulation. While results offer insights about parent-child talk in an interesting story-creation iPad app (something less common in traditional storytelling reading research), this study also challenges the Vygotskian frame&amp;rsquo;s explanatory power in this novel context. Newer frameworks such as Mercer&amp;rsquo;s intermental development zone (IDZ) and Hakkarainen&amp;rsquo;s trialogical approach of learning are deemed more suitable for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deductive–inductive thematic analysis identified three recurring themes in the parent–child talk: realistic fiction, scaffolding variations, and engaged players and objects of ‘play’. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging findings indicate that story-enhancing features provided by interactive digital stories accessible through iPads may not necessarily be beneficial. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;book-making apps (e.g., StoryMakerTM) are designed to support the sharing of user-created stories. Applications like these often ‘blend’ the affordances of oral and book-based story sharing, as they allow users to edit the content orally (i.e., users can add their own recordings to the story) but also have similar features to traditional books in terms of their book-size format and textual and visual representation (Kucirkova, Messer, Sheehy, &amp;amp; Flewitt, 2013). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the apparent convergence of modes in iPad stories and new technologies, most research has remained focused on a dichotomous comparison of paper-based versus oral story sharing (e.g., Farrant &amp;amp; Zubrick, 2012, Fivush 2008, 2011) or electronic versus paper-based books (e.g., Korat, Segal-Drori, &amp;amp; Klien, 2009; Shamir, Korat, &amp;amp; Fellah, 2012). To date, there is very little theorised documentation of parent–child interactions supported by new interactive technologies such as book-making iPad apps. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretical framework: Vygotsky’s learning theory (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky’s ideas provide ‘a natural framework within which to view parent–child literacy interactions’ (Neumann, Hood, &amp;amp; Neumann, 2009, p. 313). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To frame our understanding of the learning opportunities embedded in a new, so far little explored story-sharing context, we focus on three key concepts in this study: zone of proximal development (ZPD), dual representation and double stimulation. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky postulated that ideas and concepts originate in social and shared processes and considered child’s intellectual growth to be ‘contingent on his mastering the social means of thought, that is, language’ (Vygotsky, 1964, p. 47). Others’ thoughts become internalised as part of the child’s inner speech, which is ‘social speech turned inwards’ (Ehrich, 2006, p. 13). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky (1978) specified that objects play a major role in knowledge acquisition. Vygotsky conceptualised this through the metaphor of dual representation. According to this metaphor, an object can be understood at two levels: on a concrete level (e.g., clock as an object on the wall) and on a symbolic level (e.g., a clock that signifies time). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To investigate how children develop their knowledge through conversing with an adult, Vygotsky (1928) and his colleague Sakharov developed the experimental method of double stimulation in which a child groups together a set of wooden blocks of different shapes and colours. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that double stimulation focuses on uncovering the development of new knowledge, rather than simply the result of this development, it is well suited for dynamic assessment contexts (Portes, Smith, Zady, &amp;amp; Del Castillo, 1997). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multimedia and agency (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key features of iPad story-making apps that are different from traditional book sharing and that have particular pertinence from a Vygotskian perspective: multimedia and agency. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a reconstruction of story representation is a form of agency, which in Vygotskian terms originates in the ‘use of external artefacts to reach a redefinition of a situation’ (Engestrom, 2006, p. 6). A redefined situation is likely to transform the knowledge created within it, and the ways this knowledge is expressed. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present study (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore employed a qualitative research methodology to explore the interaction patterns of two daughter–mother pairs. This included a deductive–inductive thematic analysis (Fereday &amp;amp; Muir-Cochrane, 2008), which has been suggested as particularly useful for contexts with little prior research. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on a detailed analysis of knowledge expression (cf. Diezman &amp;amp; Watters, 1998) represented through parent–child talk in the moment of the experience. Aligned with a Vygotskian emphasis on language as the ‘tool of tools’ (Wilson, 2005, online), we focused the analysis on parent–child talk. The research questions that guided our analysis were as follows: What themes are present in parent–child talk when they create and share their own iPad stories? To what extent can the Vygotskian theoretical framework account for the knowledge expression in the parent–child story sharing mediated by the story-making iPad app? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methodology (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study participants (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two mothers and their daughters took part in the study. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study procedure (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both dyads were visited at home and given iPads (iPad 1) with a pre-loaded story-making application called Our Story. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://creet.open.ac.uk/projects/our-story/&#34;&gt;http://creet.open.ac.uk/projects/our-story/&lt;/a&gt; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two parent–child pairs were encouraged to use the app as they wished and were told that the researcher (first author of this study) would visit after 1 week to see how they liked the app and would be interested in any stories they might have created. No specific instructions were given in regard to the actual use of the app; it was emphasised that the researcher aims to simply observe and record the mothers’ and children’s natural activity with Our Story (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 1week, the researcher visited the two pairs at home again and asked about any stories made with Our Story. At this visit, the researcher observed how Mother 1 and Child 1 shared for the first time a story the mother had created for her daughter, and how Mother 2 and Child 2 spontaneously created and shared a novel story. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis method (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transcripts were analysed using a combined deductive–inductive coding (Fereday &amp;amp; MuirCochrane, 2008). This approach to thematic analysis uses ‘broad deductively determined codes to home in on the data, and then inductive coding to explore this in more detail’ (Rivas, 2012, p. 371). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before commencing an in-depth analysis, we explored the data within these broad themes and wrote a short descriptive passage to capture the issues raised within each theme and its relationship to the data. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a second step, inductive codes were derived from the data, separately for each parent–child pair. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step was followed by a customary procedure for thematic analysis, that is to say, revision of the codes through iterative and reflexive process of comparison and contrasting, leading to the development of higher-order themes (Tesch, 1990). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thematic analysis revealed three comprehensive themes (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistic fiction (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first dyad, when discussing the story plot, a major part of mother–child talk revolved around ordinary daily experiences that involved both real (e.g., mother and child) and imaginary story characters (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the mother facilitated the child’s transition from concrete to more abstract thinking (or from real to fictional stories), which includes ‘perceiving relationships’ and ‘sensing continuity and sequence’ (Carrier, 1963, p. 2). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second parent–child dyad, the talk centred around everyday activities because of the girl’s focus on the daily routines carried out by her toy clock. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child’s writing and story composing were on this occasion scaffolded by both the more knowledgeable adult (i.e., the girl’s mother) and the app, which allowed assembling together a digital photograph of the toy clock, the child’s audio-recorded sounds and her pretend typing. With both support mechanisms, the girl was able to ‘solve’ a relatively complex task of story composing, with a considerable sense of agency (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaffolding variations (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first pair, the mother verbally supported her daughter’s recall and sequence of the story so that the child could understand the story plot. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the mother skilfully ensured that the task fell within the child’s ZPD. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother 2 supported her daughter’s activity by giving instructions mostly in relation to the process of story composition. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, both mothers used different strategies for supporting different kinds of knowledge, providing their children with different opportunities for assisted performance and gradual autonomy within their ZPDs (Wood, Bruner, &amp;amp; Ross, 1976). With Mother 1 focusing on the linguistic aspects of the shared story and Mother 2 on the procedural functions of the app, there were clear differences in the nature of knowledge scaffolded (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engaged players and objects of ‘play’ (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although the process of story creation resembled a double-stimulation activity, the use of the Our Story app gave rise to a parent–child interaction that had a different learning potential than the one afforded by cultural artefacts from Vygotskian time. The app’s affordances for multimodal knowledge expression captured the process as well as representation of both the mother’s and child’s story worlds and represented these dynamically, instantaneously and in three modes (picture, audio and text). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both pairs, independent and guided problem solving collided because the child’s knowledge was scaffolded by the mothers together with the app. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both themes are intermingled within the wider notions of agency and the expanding potential of ZPD. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the app, the girl was able to compose a story merging reality and fiction and meshing the audio with typed letters and digital pictures. The app allowed her to practise emergent typing skills and to demonstrate mastery of oral language skills (during audio-recording) and provided space for a story, which lessened distinctions between fictional and real. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky believed that for the child, knowledge scaffolding happens through imitation and that a child can ‘imitate only what lies within the zone of his intellectual potential’ (Vygotsky, 1987, p. 210). However, for learning contexts where the intellectual potential of participants is jointly extended with new technological tools such as Our Story, the ZPD has less explanatory power. In the interactions observed here, we saw evidence that at times, the children too can act as a more knowledgeable other and that the activity of multimodal story making can shape mastery of traditional as well as new digital literacy skills. In such open-ended, collaborative and creative contexts, a shared communicative space is created in which both the adult and child negotiate their positions in the activity and the division of learner and teacher becomes blurred (Littleton &amp;amp; Mercer, 2013). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interpretation prompts us to extend Vygotsky’s notion of ZPD to an intermental development zone (IDZ, Mercer, 2000; Mercer &amp;amp; Littleton, 2007), in which the parent and the child (or a teacher and a learner) stay attuned to each other’s changing states of knowledge and understanding during the course of the interaction. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky addressed the importance of orienting teachers’ and parent’s support ‘not on yesterday’s development in the child but on tomorrow’s’ (Vygotsky, 1987, p. 211), and in both pairs, we saw evidence of parents’ attempt to enhance their daughter’s future skills. However, there was a difference between the expert/novice balance in the story production. The first dyad was more parent led, whereas the second story (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;produced by the child together with her mother may have facilitated a more negotiated and balanced learning space. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although double stimulation focuses the activity towards a specific goal (and examines how the child solves a problem in relation to this goal), the app has no such focus, it is a creative tool, and the problem solving occurs in relation to any activity created between the mother and child. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the object of knowledge mediation here shaped and evidenced the dynamic story-creating process of both mother and her child and afforded the possibility for visualising the process and result of the thinking processes of both partners. Vygotsky’s framework, which foregrounds the novice/teacher dichotomy in the knowledge scaffolding process, is less convincing here. This was also the case with the third theme – engaged players and new objects of play – where the app mediated knowledge expression beyond that interpretable with a traditional Vygotsky framework. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To comprehensively capture the characteristics and the learning potential of this tool, the context would be better framed as a trialogical process of learning (Sami &amp;amp; Kai, 2009). In trialogical learning, emphasis is laid on the ‘interaction through the “shared objects” that are in the process of being developed’ (Paavola &amp;amp; Hakkarainen, 2009, p.85). As with Mercer and Littleton’s concept of the IDZ, the trialogical perspective of learning acknowledges both parents and children as collaborative learners who draw on each other’s knowledge in balanced rather than top-down fashion. In addition, it encompasses the dynamic nature of co-construction of shared objects of a unique personal value. Importantly, the trialogical perspective of learning is well suited not only for describing and analysing the process but also the representation of knowledge expressed during the observed story-sharing process, that is, the final story the parent and child created. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, trialogical perspective of learning appears to be a suitable framework for future studies seeking to analyse both the process and product of knowledge representation during parent–child iPad story sharing. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study contributions (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from our findings, we can also infer that there are some affordances of story-making apps that are better explored through post-Vygotskian theories. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore conclude that the trialogical theoretical learning paradigm and the IDZ concept may provide a suitable basis for future research in this area. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not allow us to explore comparatively the different patterns of language use and parent–child engagement in different sociocultural groups (Heath, 1986; Lankshear &amp;amp; Knobel, 2011). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

Particularly, I was struck by the number and extent of the overt disagreements between social scientists about the nature of fi (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

Attempting to discover the source of that difference led me to recognize the role in scientific research of what I have since called “paradigms.” (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I. Introduction: A Role for History (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That image has previously been drawn, even by scientists themselves, mainly from the study of finished scientific achievements as these are recorded in the classics and, more (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay attempts to show that we have been misled by them in (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those texts have, for example, often seemed to imply that the content of science is uniquely exemplified by the observations, laws, and theories described in their pages. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teaching only through textbooks is doing injustice to science learning. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If science is the constellation of fa cts, theories, and methods collected in current texts, then scientists ar e the men who, successfully or not, have striven to contribute one or another element to that particular have striven to contribute one or another element to that particular constellation. Scientific development becomes the piecemeal process by constellation. Scientific development becomes the piecemeal process (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, however, a few historians of science have been finding it more and more difficult to fulfil the functions that the concept of development-by-accumulation assigns to them. As chroniclers of an development-by-accumulation assigns (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these out-ofdate beliefs are to be called myths, then myths can be produced by the same sorts of methods and held for the same sorts of reasons that now lead to scienti fic knowledge. If, on the other hand, they are to be called science, then science has included bodies of belief quite incompatible with the ones we hold today. Given these alternatives, the historian must choose the latter. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What aspects of science will emerge to prominence in the course of this effort? First, at least in order of presentation, is the insufficiency of methodological directives, by themselves, to dictate a unique substantive conclusion to many sorts of scientifi (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What differentiated these various schools was not one or anothe r failure of method— they were all “scientific”—but what we shall come to call their incommensurable ways of seeing the world and of practici (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;incommensurable ways of seeing the world and of practicing science in it &amp;ndash; a beautiful way of describing the issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on many debates in ed research, are we isolating us in our own incommensurable ways of seeing the world? (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal and historical accident, is always a formative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scienti fic community at a given time. community at a given time. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That element of arbitrariness does not, however, indicate that any entific group could practice its trade without some set of received scientific group could practice its trade without some set of received beliefs. Nor does it make less consequential the particular constellation (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;research scarcely begins before a scientific community thinks it has acquired firm answers to questions like the following: What are the acquired firm answers to questionfundamental entities (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;examining normal science in Sections III, IV, and V, we shall want finally to describe that research as a strenuous and devoted attempt to force nature into the conceptual boxes supplied by professional education. Simultaneously, we shall wonder whether research could proceed without such boxes, whatever the element of arbitrariness in their historic origins and, occasionally, in their subsequent development. historic origins and, occasionally, in their subsequent development. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fundamental novelties because they are necessarily subversive of its basic commitments. Nevertheless, so long as those commitments retain an element of the arbitrary, the very nature of normal research ensures an element of the arbitrary, the very nature of normal research ensures that novelty shall not be suppressed for very long. Sometimes a normal that novelty shall not be suppressed for very long. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these and other ways besides, normal science repeatedly goes astray. And when it does—when, that is, the profession can no longer evade And when it does—when, that is, the profession can no longer evade anomalies that subvert the existing tradition of scientific practice—then anomalies that subvert the existing tradition of scientific practice—then begin the extraordinary investigations th at lead the profession at last to a new set of commitments, a new basis for the practice of science. The extraordinary episodes in which that shift of professional commitments occurs are the ones known in this essay as scientific revolutions. They are the tradition-shattering complements to the tradition-bound activity are the tradition-shattering complements to the tradition-bound activity of normal science. of normal science. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;necessitated the community’s rejection of one time-honored scientific theory in favor of another incompatible with it. Each produced a consequent shift in the problems available for scientific scrutiny and in the standards by which the profession determined what should count as an admissible problem or as a legitimate problem-solution. And each transformed the scientific imagination in ways that we shall ultimately need to describe as a transformation of the world within which scientific work was done. Such changes, together with the controversies that almost always accompany them, are the de fining characteristics of scientific revolutions. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new theories regularly, and appropriately, evokes the same response from some of the specialists on whose area of special competence they from some of the specialists on whose area of special competence they impinge. For these men the new theory implies a change in the rules impinge. For these men the new theory implies a change in the rules governing the prior practice of normal science. Inevitably, therefore, it reflects upon much scientific work they have already successfully completed. That is why a new theory, however special its range of application, is seldom or never just an increment to what is already known. Its assimilation requires the reconstruction of prior theory and the re-evaluation of prior fact, an in trinsically revolutionary process that (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a new theory is seldom or never just an increment to what is already know! (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the unexpected discovery is not simply factual in its import and why the scientist’s world is qualitatively transformed as well as quantitatively enriched by fundamental novelties of either fact or theory. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;descriptive discipline. The theses suggested above are, however, often (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;II. The Route to Normal Science (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘normal science’ means research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AKA textbook science; canons (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;accepted theory, illustrate many or a ll of its successful applications, and compare these applications with exemplary observations and compare these applications with exemplary observations and experiments. Before such books became popular early in the nineteenth experiments. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were able to do so because they shared two essential characteristics. Their achievement was sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity. Simultaneously, it was sufficiently open-ended to leave all sorts of problems for the redefined group of practitioners to resolve. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fruitfulness (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achievements that share these two characteristics I shall henceforth refer to as ‘paradigms,’ a term that relates closely to ‘normal science.’ (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;particular coherent traditions of scientific research (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;paradigms, including many that are far more specialized than those named illustratively above, is what mainly prepares the student for membership in the particular scientific community with which he will later practice. Because he there joins men who learned the bases of their later practice. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scientific community &amp;ndash; mentioning it is important. Link with identity (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;research is based on shared paradi gms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice. That commitment and the apparent consensus it produces are prerequisites for normal science, i.e., for the genesis and continuation of a particular research tradition. i.e., for the genesis and continuation of a particular research tradition. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what sense is the shared paradigm a fundamental unit for the student of scientific development, a unit that cannot be fully reduced to logically (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;paradigm and of the more esoteric type of research it permits is a sign of maturity in the development of any given scientific field. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These transformations of the paradigms of physical optics are scientific revolutions, and the successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At various times all these schools made signi ficant contributions to the body of concepts, phenomena, and techniques from which Newton drew the first nearly uniformly accepted paradigm for physical optics. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;physical optics before Newton may well conclude that, though the field’s practitioners were scientists, the net result of their activity was something less than science. Being able to take no common body of belief for granted, each writer on phys ical optics felt forced to build his field anew from its foundations. In doing so, his choice of supporting observation and experiment was relatively free, for there was no standard set of methods or of phenomena that every optical writer felt forced to employ and explain. Under these circumstances, the dialogue of the resulting books was often directed as much to the members of other schools as it was to nature. That pattern is not unfamiliar in a number of creative fields today, nor is it incompatible with significant discovery and invention. It is not, however, the pattern of development that physical optics acquired af ter Newton and that other natural sciences make familiar today. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting. So the establishment of a paradigm benefits continual growth of a body of work. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only through the work of Franklin and his immediate successors did a theory arise that could account with something like equal facility for very nearly all th ese effects and that therefore could and did provide a subsequent gene ration of “electricians” with a common paradigm for its research. common paradigm for its research. Excluding those fields, like math (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NA (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;question what parts of social science have yet acquired such paradigms at all. History suggests that the road to a firm research consensus is extraordinarily arduous. the road to a firm research consensus is extraordinarily arduous. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;candidate for paradigm, all of the facts that could possibly pertain to the development of a given science are likely to seem equally relevant. As a result, early fact-gathering is a far more nearly random activity than the one that subsequent scientific development makes familiar. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the crafts are one readily accessible source of facts that could not have been casually discovered, technology (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;has often played a vital role in the emergence of new sciences. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No natural history can be interpreted in the absence of at least some implicit body (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of intertwined theoretical and me thodological belief that permits selection, evaluation, and criticism. If that body of belief is not already implicit in the collection of facts—in which case more than “mere facts” are at hand—it must be externally supplied, perhaps by a current metaphysic, by another science, or by personal and historical accident. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fluid and therefore gave particular emphasis to conduction provide an excellent case in point. Led by this belief, which could scarcely cope with the known multiplicity of attractive and repulsive effects, several of them conceived the idea of bottling the electrical fluid. The immediate fruit of their efforts was the Leyden jar, a device which might never have been discovered by a man exploring nature casually or at random, but which was in fact independently developed by at least two investigators in the 7early 1740’s. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be accepted as a paradigm, a etitors, but theory must seem better than its competitors, but (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it need not, and in fact never does, explain all the facts with which it can be confronted. What the fluid theory of electricity did for the subgroup that held it, the Franklinian paradigm later did for the entire group of electricians. It suggested which experiments would be worth performing and which, because directed to secondary or to overly complex manifestations of (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freed from the concern with any and all electrical phenomena, the united group of electricians could pursue selected phenomena in far more detail, designing much special equipment for the task and employing it more designing much special equipment for the task and employing it more stubbornly and systematically than electricians had ever done before. stubbornly and systematically than electricians had ever done before. Both fact collection and theory arti culation became highly directed (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promisingness judgments become easier (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;emergence of a paradigm affects the structure of the group that practices the field. When, in the development of a natural science, an individual or group first produces a synthesis able to attract most of the next generation’s practitioners, the older schools gradually disappear. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gm implies a new and more rigid definition of the field. Those unwilling or unable to accommodate their work to it must proceed in isolation or attach themselves to some other work to it must proceed in isolation or attach themselves to some other group.11 Historically, they have often simply stayed in the departments group.11 Historically, they have often simply stayed in the departments of philosophy from which so many of the special sciences have been of philosophy from which so many of the special sciences have been spawned. As these indications hint, it is sometimes just its reception of a paradigm that transforms a group previously interested merely in the paradigm that transforms a group previously interested merely in the study of nature into a profession or, at least, a discipline. In the sciences study of nature into a profession or, at least, a discipline. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting.. so we are heading to the philosophy department if we are deemed useless in our own professions. Haha.  (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more rigid definition of the scienti fic group has other consequences. When the individual scientist can take a paradigm for granted, he need no longer, in his major works, attempt to build his fi eld anew (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a textbook, however, the creative scientist can begin his research where it leaves off and thus concentrate exclusively upon the subtlest and most esoteric aspect s of the natural phenomena that subtlest and most esoteric aspect s of the natural phenomena that concern his group. And as he does this, his research communiqués will begin to change in (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To d a y i n t h e s c i e n c e s , b o o k s a r e u s u a lly either texts or retrospective reflections upon one aspect or another of the scientific life. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;guide the whole group’s research. Except with the advantage of hindsight, it is hard to find another criterion that so clearly proclaims a field a science. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;III. The Nature of Normal Science (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sc ience, on the other hand, a paradigm is rarely an object for replication. Instead, like an accepted judicial decision in the common law, it is an object for further articulation and specification under new or more stringent conditions. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he success of a paradigm—whether Aristotle’s analysis of motion, Ptolemy’s computations of planetary position, Lavoisier’s application of the balance, or Maxwell’s mathematization of the electromagnetic field—is at the start largely a promise of success discoverable in selected and (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;still incomplete examples. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal science consists in the actualization of that promise, an actualization achieved by extending the knowledge of those facts that the paradigm displays as particularly revealing, by increasing the extent of the match between those facts and the paradigm’s predictions, and by further articulation of the paradigm itself. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mop-ping-up operations are what engage most scientists throughout their careers. They constitute what I am here calling normal science. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor do scientists normally aim to invent new theories, and they are often intolerant of those invented by others.1 Instead, normal-scientific research is directed to the articulation of those phenomena and theories that the paradigm already supplies. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On what aspects of nature do scientists ordinarily report? What determines their choice? And, since most scientific observation consumes much time, equipment, and money, what motivates the scientist to pursue that choice to a conclusion? (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts to increase the accuracy and scope with which facts like these are known occupy a significant fraction of the literature of experimental and observational science. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some scientists have acquired great reputations, not from any novelty of their discoveries, but from the precision, reliability, and scope of the methods they developed for the redetermination of a previously known sort of fact. (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apparatus (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of the paradigm sets the problem to be solved; often the paradigm theory is implicated directly in the design of apparatus able to solve the problem (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third class of experiments and observations exhausts, I think, the fact-gathering activities of normal science. It consists of empirical work undertaken to articulate the paradigm theory, resolving some of its residual ambiguities and permitting the solution of problems to which it had previously only drawn attention. This class proves to be the most important of all, and its description demands its subdivision (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;experimentalists (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;great stories about theoretical physicists working with experimental physicists etc (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coulomb’s success depended upon his constructing special apparatus to measure the force between point charges (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that design, in turn, depended upon the previous recognition that every particle of electric fluid acts upon every other at a distance. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part of normal theoretical work, though only a small part, consists simply in the use of existing theory to predict factual information of intrinsic value. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for work of this sort arises from the immense difficulties often encountered in developing points of contact between a theory and nature. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the mathematical sciences there are also theoretical problems of paradigm articulation; and during periods when scientific development is predominantly qualitative, these problems dominate. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than any other sort of normal research, the problems of paradigm articulation are simultaneously theoretical and experimental; (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were working both with fact and with theory, and their work produced not simply new information but a more precise paradigm, obtained by the elimination of ambiguities that the original from which they worked had retained. In many sciences, most normal work is of this sort. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three classes of problems—determination of significant fact, matching of facts with theory, and articulation of theory-exhaust, I think, the literature of normal science, both empirical and theoretical. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, therefore, th e overwhelming majority of the problems undertaken by even the very best scientists usually fall into one of the three categories outlined above. Work under the paradigm can be conducted in no other way, and to desert the paradigm is to cease practicing the science it defines. We shall shortly discover that such desertions do occur. They are the pivots about which scientific revolutions turn. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IV. Normal Science as Puzzle-solving (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most striking feature of the normal research problems we have just encountered is how little they aim to produce major novelties, conceptual or phenomenal. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they yielded neit her consistent nor simple results, they could not be used to articulate the paradigm from which they derived. Therefore, they remained mere facts, unrelated and unrelatable to the continuing progress of electrical research. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the aim of normal science is not major substantive novelties—if failure to come near the anticipated result is usually (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;failure as a scientist—then why are these problems undertaken at all? (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing a normal research pr oblem to a conclusion is achieving the anticipated in a new way, and it requires the solution of all sorts of complex instrumental, conceptual, and mathematical puzzles. The man who succeeds proves himself an expert puzzle-solver, and the challenge of the puzzle is an important part of what usually drives him on. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no criterion of goodness in a puzzle that its outcome be intrinsically interesting or important. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n e o f t h e t h i n g s a s c i e n t i fic community acquires with a paradigm is a criterion for choosing problems that, while the paradigm is taken for granted, can be assumed to have solutions. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other problems, including many that had previously been standard, are rejected as metaphysical, as the concern of another discipline, or sometimes as just too problematic to be worth the time. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man may be attracted to science for all sorts of reasons. Among them are the desire to be useful, the excitement of exploring new territory, the hope of finding order, a n d t h e d r i ve t o t e s t e s t a b l i s h e d knowledge. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the rules that govern jigsaw-puzzle solutions (p. 50)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a change in the rules of the game could have provided an alternative. (p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they continue to be honored, such statements help to set puzzles and to limit acceptable solutions. (p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less local and temporary, though still not unchanging characteristics of science, are the higher level, quasi-metaphysical commitments that historical study so regularly displays. (p. 53)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after the appearance of Descartes’s immensely influential scientific writings, most physical scientists assumed that the universe was composed of microscopic corpuscles and that all natural phenomena could be explained in terms of corpuscular shape, size, motion, and interaction. That nest of commitments proved to be both metaphysical and methodological. As metaphysical, it told scientists what sorts of entities the universe did and did not contain: there was only shaped matter in motion. As methodological, it told them what ultimate laws and fundamental explanations must be like: laws must specify corpuscular motion and interaction, and explanation must reduce any given natural phenomenon to corpuscular action under these laws. (p. 53)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at a still higher level, there is another set of commitments without which no man is a scientist. The scientist must, for example, be concerned to understand the world and to extend the precision and scope with which it has been ordered. That commitment must, in turn, lead him to scrutinize, either for himself or through colleagues, some aspect of nature in great empirical detail. And, if that scrutiny displays pockets of apparent disorder, then these must challenge him to a new refinement of his observational techniques or to a further articulation of his theories. (p. 54)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of this strong network of commitments—conceptual, theoretical, instrumental, and methodological—is a principal source of the metaphor that relates normal science to puzzle-solving. Because it provides rules that tell the practitioner of a mature specialty what both the world and his science are like, he can concentrate with assurance upon the esoteric problems that these rules and existing knowledge define for him. (p. 54)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ules, I suggest, derive from paradigms, but paradigms can guide research even in the absence of rules. (p. 54)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V. T h e P r i o r i t y o f P a r a d i g m s (p. 55)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, if the coherence of the research tradition is to be understood in terms of rules, some specification of common ground in the corresponding area is needed. As a result, the search for a body of rules competent to constitute a given normal research tradition becomes a source of continual and deep frustration. (p. 56)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, the first effect of those statements is to raise problems. In the absence of a competent body of rules, what restricts the scientist to a particular normal-scientific tradition? What can the phrase ‘direct inspection of paradigms’ mean? Partial answers to questions like these were developed by the late Ludwig Wittgenstein (p. 56)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What need we know, Wittgenstein asked, in order that we (p. 56)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apply terms like ‘chair,’ or ‘leaf,’ or ‘game’ unequivocally and without provoking argument?2 (p. 57)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That question is very old and has generally been answered by saying that we must know, consciously or intuitively, what a chair, or leaf, or game is. We m u s t , t h a t i s , g r a s p s o m e s e t of attributes that all games and that only games have in common. Wittgenstein, however, concluded that, given the way we use language and the sort of world to which we apply it, there need be no such set of characteristics. (p. 57)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists work from models acquired through education and through subsequent exposure to the literature often without quite knowing or needing to know what characteristics have given these models the status of community paradigms. (p. 58)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coherence displayed by the research tradition in which they participate may not imply even the existence of an underlying body of rules and assumptions that additional historical or philosophical investigation might uncover. (p. 58)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o far this p oint has been entirely theoretical: paradigms could determine normal science without the intervention of discoverable rules. (p. 58)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, which has already been discussed quite fully, is the severe difficulty of discovering the rules that have guided particular normal-scientific traditions. (p. 58)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, to which the first is really a corollary, i s r o o t e d i n t h e n a t ure of scientific education. Scientists, it should already be clear, never learn concepts, laws, and theories in the abstract and by themselves. Instead, these intellectual tools are from the start encountered in a historically and pedagogically prior unit that displays them with and through their applications. (p. 58)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they continue to be closely modeled on previous achievements as are the problems that normally occupy him during his subsequent independent scientific career. One is at liberty to suppose that somewhere along the way the scientist has intuitively abstracted rules of the game for himself, but there is little reason to believe it. (p. 59)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they are little better than laymen at characterizing the established bases of their field, its legitimate problems and methods. (p. 59)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth reason for granting paradigms a status prior to that of shared rules and assumptions (p. 61)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction to this essay suggested that there can be small revolutions as well as large ones, that some revolutions affect only the members of a professional subspecialty, and that for such groups even the discovery of a new and unexpected phenomenon may be revolutionary. (p. 61)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If normal science is so rigid and if scientific communities are so close-knit as the preceding discussion has implied, how can a change of paradigm ever affect only a small subgroup? What has been said so far may have seemed to imply that normal science is a single monolithic and unified enterprise that must stand or fall with any one of its paradigms as well as with all of them together. But science is obviously seldom or never like that. Often, viewing all fields together, it seems instead a rather ramshackle structure with little coherence among its various parts. (p. 61)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, substituting paradigms for rules should make the diversity of scientific fields and specialties easier to understand. Explicit rules, when they exist, are usually common to a very broad scientific group, but paradigms need not be. (p. 61)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, though quantum mechanics (or Newtonian dynamics, or electromagnetic theory) is a paradigm for many scientific groups, it is not the same paradigm for them all. (p. 62)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VI. Anomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries (p. 64)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal science, the puzzle-solving activity we have just examined, is a highly cumulative enterprise (p. 64)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet one standard prod uct of the scientific enterprise is missing. Normal science does not aim at novelties of fact or theory and, when successful, finds none. (p. 64)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History even suggests that the scientific enterprise has developed a uniquely powerful technique for producing surprises of this sort. (p. 64)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That distinction between discovery and invention or between fact and theory will, however, immediately prove to be exceedingly artificial. Its artificiality is an important clue to several of this essay’s main theses. (p. 64)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovery commences with the awareness of anomaly, i.e., with the recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm-induced (p. 64)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;expectations that govern normal science. It then continues with a more or less extended exploration of the area of anomaly. And it closes only when the paradigm theory has been adjusted so that the anomalous has become the expected. Assimilating a new sort of fact demands a more than additive adjustment of theory, and until that adjustment is completed—until the scientist has learned to see nature in a different way—the new fact is not quite a scientific fact at all. (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To s e e h o w c l o s e l y f a c t u a l a n d t h e o r e t i c a l n o v e l t y a r e i n t e r t w i n e d i n scientific discovery examine a particularly famous example, the discovery of oxygen. (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly we need a new vocabulary and concepts for analyzing events like the discovery of oxygen. Though undoubtedly correct, the sentence, “Oxygen was discovered,” misleads by suggesting that discovering something is a single simple act assimilable to our usual (and also questionable) concept of seeing. That is why we so readily assume that discovering, like seeing or touching, should be unequivocally attributable to an individual and to a moment in time. (p. 67)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;any attempt to date the discovery must inevitably be arbitrary because discovering a new sort of phenomenon is necessarily a complex event, one which involves recognizing both that something is and what it is. (p. 67)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That theory was the keystone for a reformulation of chemistry so vast that it is usually called the chemical revolution. (p. 68)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice, however, since it will be important later, that the discovery of oxygen was not by itself the cause of the change in chemical theory. Long before he played any part in the discovery of the new gas, Lavoisier was convinced both that something was wrong with the phlogiston theory and that burning bodies absorbed some part of the atmosphere. (p. 68)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither ox ygen nor X-rays emerged without a further process of experimentation and assimilation. At what point in Roentgen’s investigation, for example, ought we say that X-rays had actually been discovered? No (p. 69)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor, it is almost as clear, can the moment of discovery be pushed forward to a point during the last week of investigation, by which time Roentgen was exploring the properties of the new radiation he had already discovered. We can only say that X-rays emerged in Würzburg between November 8 and December 28, 1895. (p. 70)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, consciously or not, the decision to employ a particular piece of apparatus and to use it in a particular way carries an assumption that only certain sorts of circumstances will arise. There are instrumental as well as theoretical expectations, and they have often played a decisive role in scientific development. (p. 71)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradigm procedures and applications are as necessary to science as paradigm laws and theories, and they have the same effects. Inevitably they restrict the phenom- enological field accessible for scientific investigation (p. 72)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that much, we may simultaneously see an essential sense in which a discovery like X-rays necessitates paradigm change—and therefore change in both procedures and expectations—for a special segment of the scientific community. As a result, we may also understand how the discovery of X-rays could seem to open a strange new world to many scientists and could thus participate so effectively in the crisis that led to twentieth-century physics. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final example of scientific discovery, that of the Leyden jar, belongs to a class that may be described as theory-induced (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not all theories are paradigm theories. (p. 73)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those characteristics include: the previous awareness of anomaly, the gradual and simultaneous emergence of both observational and conceptual recognition, and the consequent change of paradigm categories and procedures often accompanied by resistance. (p. 74)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either as a metaphor or because it reflects the nature of the mind, that psychological experiment provides a wonderfully simple and cogent schema for the process of scientific discovery. In science, as in the playing card experiment, novelty emerges only with difficulty, manifested by resistance, against a background provided by expectation. Initially, only the anticipated and usual are experienced even under circumstances where anomaly is later to be observed. Further acquaintance, however, does result in awareness of something wrong or does relate the effect to something that has gone wrong before. That awareness of anomaly opens a period in which conceptual categories are adjusted until the initially anomalous has become the anticipated. At this point the discovery has been completed. I have already urged that that process or one very much like it is involved in the emergence of all fundamental scientific novelties. (p. 76)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the development of any science, the first received paradigm is usually felt to account quite successfully for most of the observations and experiments easily accessible to that science’s practitioners. Further development, therefore, ordinarily calls for the construction of elaborate equipment, the development of an esoteric vocabulary and skills, and a refinement of concepts that increasingly lessens their resemblance to their usual common-sense prototypes. That professionalization leads, on the one hand, to an immense restriction of the scientist’s vision and to a considerable resistance to paradigm change. The science has become increasingly rigid. On the other hand, within those areas to which the paradigm directs the attention of the (p. 76)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;group, normal science leads to a detail of information and to a precision of the observation-theory match that could be achieved in no other way. (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;novelty or dinarily emerges only for the man who, knowing with precision what he should expect, is able to recognize that something has gone wrong. Anomaly appears only against the background provided by the paradigm. The more precise and far- reaching that paradigm is, the more sensitive an indicator it provides of anomaly and hence of an occasion for paradigm change. (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By ensuring that the paradigm will not be too easily surrendered, resistance guarantees that scientists will not be lightly distracted and that the anomalies that lead to paradigm change will penetrate existing knowledge to the core. The very fact that a significant scientific novelty so often emerges simultaneously from several laboratories is an index both to the strongly traditional nature of normal science and to the completeness with which that traditional pursuit prepares the way for its own change. (p. 77)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petropoulou, O., Kasimatis, K., Dimopoulos, I., and Retalis, S. (2014). Lae-r: A new learning analytics tool in moodle for assessing students’ performance. Bulletin of the IEEE Technical Committee on Learning Technology, 16(1):1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short paper introduces Learning Analytics Enriched Rubric (LAe-R), an assessment plugin in Moodle. One unique thing about this tool is it allows the teacher to create rubrics by themselves and map aspects of learning with specific activities in Moodle. Empower teachers to make this judgment based on their professionism is a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STATE OF THE ART OF MOODLE RELATED LEARNING ANALYTICS TOOLS (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GISMO is a visualization tool for Moodle, which uses log data, process them and finally produces graphical representations that can be used by teachers so as to examine social, cognitive and/or behavioral student interactions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOCLog is a sum of tools that are used for the analysis and presentation of log data within Moodle. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excel Pivot Tables is a tool that can be used for the production of learning statistics coming from Moodle. Moodle itself exports its data from the log files in spreadsheet form (Excel), through which the user can feed in data and create Pivot Tables. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Learning Analytics Enriched Rubric (LAe-R) tool was created as a Moodle plug-in (version 2.2+). It is being integrated as an advanced grading method of Moodle. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytics and Recommendations is installed within Moodle as a supplement block and can be used both by (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;teachers and students. It is a tool for the visualization of students&amp;rsquo; involvement in each activity of an online course as well as a consultation tool, which can recommend activities to students so that they can improve their attainment. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USING LAe-R&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when creating an ER, a teacher can add (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;types of criteria that are associated to learning and interaction analysis indicators such as collaboration, grades to assignments, study of learning resources. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Ladson-Billings2006-um&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladson-Billings, G. (2006). From the achievement gap to the education debt: Understanding achievement in U.S. schools. Educational Researcher, 35(7), 3–12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a powerful piece illuminating the issue with the &lt;em&gt;achievement gap&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; or, for a better phrase, &lt;em&gt;education debt&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; in the US. By tracing down the roots of the education debt, it paints a wholer picture of the problem, esp. for a foreigner like myself who does not share the collective memories mentioned in the paper. As I commented below,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a powerful analogy that transforms how we might look at the problem. The words themselves - gap vs. debt - involve different ways of thinking about the issue. While gap focuses on the status quo, debt looks backwards into the history and embodies more urgency of paying it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no way to start again from scratch, Ladson-Billings offers some insights for educational researchers to ponder on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where could we go to begin from the ground up to build the kind of education system that would aggressively address the debt? &amp;hellip; It would have to be a place where our Institutional Review Board and human subject concerns would not keep us from proposing aggressive and cutting-edge research. It would have to be a place where people were so desperate for the expertise of education researchers that we could conduct multiple projects using multiple approaches. It would be a place so hungry for solutions that it would not matter if some projects were quantitative and others were qualitative. It would not matter if some were large-scale and some were small-scale. It would not matter if some paradigms were psychological, some were social, some were economic, and some were cultural. The only thing that would matter in an environment like this would be that education researchers were bringing their expertise to bear on education problems that spoke to pressing concerns of the public. I wonder where we might find such a place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have previously aligned my research with the more &amp;lsquo;basic&amp;rsquo; research into learning, no one living in this country, or this world, or no one researching and practicing education, could become immune to the debt. It is important to keep these thoughts on/in one&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;moral compass&amp;rsquo; and to take actions in whatever possible manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article argues that a focus on the gap is mis- placed. Instead, we need to look at the “education debt” that has accumulated over time. This debt comprises historical, economic, sociopolitical, and moral components. The author draws an analogy with the concept of national debt—which she contrasts with that of a national budget deficit—to argue the significance of the education debt. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We seem to study them but rarely provide the kind of remedies that help them to solve their problems. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, because education is an applied field, a field that local states manage and declare must be available to the entire public, most of the questions that education researchers ask need to address the significant questions that challenge and con- found the public: (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freedom to pursue &amp;lsquo;basic research&amp;rsquo;. Also attending to problems of interest to the pubic. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am concerned about the meaning of our work for the larger public—for real students, teachers, administrators, parents, policymakers, and communities in real school settings. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth B. Clark, who, in the 1950s, was one of the first social scientists to bring research to the public in a meaningful way. His work with his wife and colleague Mamie formed the basis for the landmark Brown v. Board of Education (1954) case that reversed legal segregation in public schools and other public accommoda- tions. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prevalence of the Achievement Gap (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the National Governors’ Association, the achievement gap is “a matter of race and class. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress results, the gap between Black and Latina/o fourth graders and their White counterparts in reading scaled scores was more than 26 points. In fourth-grade mathematics the gap was more than 20 points (Education Commission of the States, 2005). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down the Rabbit-Hole (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it also exists when we compare dropout rates and relative numbers of students who take advanced placement examinations; enroll in honors, advanced placement, and “gifted” classes; and are admit- ted to colleges and graduate and professional programs. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I traveled with my trusty copy of Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) Metaphors We Live By as a way to make sense of my sojourn there. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars have offered a variety of explanations for the existence of the gap. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, scholars identified cultural deficit theories (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This once mainstream viewpoint sounds scary nowadays, but may still exist in every corner of the American society, or may still be the dominant view in some other societies around the world. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Debt Versus National Deficit (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social psychologist Claude Steele (1999) argues that a “stereo- type threat” contributes to the gap. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most fiscal conservatives warn against deficit budgets and urge the government to decrease spending to balance the budget. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This level of debt means that the United States pays about $132,844,701,219.88 in interest each year. This makes our debt interest the third-largest expenditure in the federal budget after defense and combined entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare (Christensen, 2004). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to argue that this all-out focus on the “Achievement Gap” moves us toward short-term solutions that are unlikely to address the long-term underlying problem. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in those years when the United States has had a balanced budget, that is, no deficits, the national debt continued to grow. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Debt and Education Disparity (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the gap from year to year is a misleading exer- cise. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inconsistency of different administrations is hurting. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not have good answers as to why the gap narrows or widens. Some research suggests that even the combina- tion of socioeconomic and family conditions, youth culture and stu- dent behaviors, and schooling conditions and practices do not fully explain changes in the achievement gap (Lee). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am arguing that our focus on the achievement gap is akin to a focus on the budget deficit, but what is actually happening to African American and Latina/o students is really more like the national debt. We do not have an achievement gap; we have an education debt. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a powerful analogy that transforms how we might look at the problem. The words themselves - gap vs. debt - involve different ways of thinking about the issue. While gap focuses on the status quo, debt looks backwards into the history and embodies more urgency of paying it back. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am arguing that the historical, economic, sociopolitical, and moral decisions and policies that characterize our society have created an education debt. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The education debt is the foregone schooling resources that we could have (should have) been investing in (primarily) low income kids, which deficit leads to a variety of social problems (e.g. crime, low productivity, low wages, low labor force participation) that require on-going public investment. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Historical Debt (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars in the history of education, such as James Anderson (1989), Michael Fultz (1995), and David Tyack (2004), have doc- umented the legacy of educational inequities in the Unites States. Those inequities initially were formed around race, class, and gen- der. Gradually, some of the inequities began to recede, but clearly they persist in the realm of race. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolfe and Haveman (2001) entitled Accounting for the Social and Non-Market Benefits of Education, which catalogues a series of what they term “non-market effects of schooling.” The authors contend that “the literature on the intergenerational effects of education is generally neglected in assessing the full impact of education.” (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Black students in the South did not experience universal secondary schooling until 1968 (Anderson, 2002). Why, then, would we not expect there to be an achieve- ment gap? (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, that&amp;rsquo;s a debt. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of American Indian education is equally egregious. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy of deliberate and forced assimilation created a group of people, according to Pulitzer Prize writer N. Scott Momaday, who belonged nowhere (Lesiak, 1991). The assimilated Indian could not fit comfortably into reservation life or the stratified mainstream. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latina/o students also experienced huge disparities in their education. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Economic Debt (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economics of the education debt are sober- ing. The funding disparities that currently exist between schools serving White students and those serving students of color are not recent phenomena. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the funding disparities between urban schools and their suburban counterparts (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief perusal of some of the history of public schooling in the United States documents the way that we have accumulated an education debt over time. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern of inequitable funding has occurred over centuries. For many of these popula- tions, schooling was nonexistent during the early history of the nation; and, clearly, Whites were not prepared to invest their fis- cal resources in these strange “others.” (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important part of the economic component of the education debt is the earning ratios related to years of schooling. The empirical data suggest that more schooling is associated with higher earnings (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to economists Joseph Altonji and Ulrech Doraszelski (2005), The wealth gap between whites and blacks in the United States is much larger than the gap in earnings. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because wealth is a source of political and social power, influences access to capital for new businesses, and provides insurance against fluctuations in labor market income. It affects the quality of housing, neighborhoods, and schools a family has access to as well as the ability to finance higher education. The fact that friendships and family ties tend to be within racial groups amplifies the effect of the wealth gap on the financial, social, and political resources available to blacks relative to whites. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest example that we have of such a dramatic policy move is that of affirmative action. Rather than wait for students of color to meet predetermined standards, the society decided to recognize that historically denied groups should be given a preference in admission to schools and colleges. Ultimately, the major beneficia- ries of this policy were White women. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the wealth disparity better reflects the education debt (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sociopolitical Debt (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black, Latina/o, and Native communities had little or no access to the franchise, so they had no true legislative representation. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite pissed by the exclusion of Asian in the discussion.  (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the sociopolitical component of the education debt, families of color have regularly been excluded from the decision- making mechanisms that should ensure that their children receive quality education. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parent–teacher organizations, school site councils, and other possibilities for democratic participation have not been available for many of these families. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;African American, Latina/o, Native Amer- ican, and Asian American parents have often advocated for improve- ments in schooling, but their advocacy often has been muted and marginalized. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a major aspect of the modern civil rights movement was the quest for quality schooling. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but the real danger of our discussions about morality is that they reside solely in the realm of the individual. We want people to take personal responsibility for their behavior, personal responsibility for their health care, personal responsibility for their welfare, and personal responsibility for their education. However, in democratic nations, that personal responsibility must be coupled with social responsibility. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Moral Debt (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did find in the litera- ture was the concept of “moral panics” (Cohen, 1972; Goode &amp;amp; Ben-Yehuda, 1994a, 1994b; Hall, Critcher, Jefferson, Clarke, &amp;amp; Roberts, 1978) that was popularized in British sociology. People in moral panics attempt to describe other people, groups of indi- viduals, or events that become defined as threats throughout a society. However, in such a panic the magnitude of the supposed threat overshadows the real threat posed. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t the recent rhetoric around Muslims an example of moral panics? (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a moral debt reflects the disparity between what we know is right and what we actually do. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This links to what Darling-Hammond describes about grade retention to boost the graduation rate and teaching for tests. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the groups that labored in the Hawaiian plantations—the Native Hawaii- ans, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Filipinos, the Koreans, the Por- tuguese, the Puerto Ricans, and the Blacks—drove a sugar economy that sated a worldwide sweet tooth (Wilcox, 1998). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we recognize the moral debt that we owe to entire groups of people? How do we calculate such a debt? (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And perhaps our largest moral debt is to the indigenous peo- ples whose presence was all but eradicated from the nation. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Gill (2000) asserts, in his book Being Good, that “we are living today in an ethical wilderness—a wild, untamed, unpre- dictable landscape” (p. 11). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Value of Understanding the Debt in Relation to Past Research Findings (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of our scholarly effort has gone into looking at educational inequality and how we might mitigate it. Despite how hard we try, there are two interventions that have never received full and sustained hypothesis testing—school desegregation and funding equity. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the historic, economic, sociopolitical, and moral debt that we have amassed toward Black, Brown, Yellow, and Red children seems insurmountable, and attempts at address- ing it seem futile. Indeed, it appears like a task for Sisyphus. But as legal scholar Derrick Bell (1994) indicated, just because some- thing is impossible does not mean it is not worth doing. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why We Must Address the Debt (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, we must address it because it is the equitable and just thing to do. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Frankenberg, Lee, and Orfield (2003) and Orfield and Lee (2004), America’s public schools are more than a decade into a process of resegregation. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us live in the world of the pragmatic and practical. So we must address the education debt because it has implications for the kinds of lives we can live and the kind of education the soci- ety can expect for most of its children. I want to suggest that there are three primary reasons for addressing the debt—(a) the impact the debt has on present education progress, (b) the value of under- standing the debt in relation to past education research findings, and &amp;copy; the potential for forging a better educational future. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding equity problem, as I illustrated earlier in this dis- cussion, also has been intractable. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Impact of the Debt on Present Education Progress (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian Americans, who are 3.7% of the adult population, make up 5% of wealthy investors (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did most of them arrive in the US? Where did their wealth come from? How does this representation maps onto different sorts of &amp;lsquo;debts&amp;rsquo; described above (esp. sociopolitical debt)? It needs to be unpacked. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryk and Schneider (2002) identified “relational trust” as a key component in school reform. I argue that the magnitude of the education debt erodes that trust and represents a portion of the debt service that teachers and administrators pay each year against what they might rightfully invest in helping students advance academically. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to conventional wisdom, Rothstein and Wilder argue that addressing the achievement gap is not the most impor- tant inequality to attend to. Rather, they contend that inequalities in health, early childhood experiences, out-of-school experiences, and economic security are also contributory and cumulative and make it near-impossible for us to reify the achievement gap as the source and cause of social inequality. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where they remind us, as education researchers, that we do not merely have an achievement gap—we have an education debt. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Potential for Forging a Better Educational Future (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where could we go to begin from the ground up to build the kind of educa- tion system that would aggressively address the debt? (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have to be a place where our Institutional Review Board and human subject concerns would not keep us from proposing aggressive and cutting-edge research. It would have to be a place where people were so desperate for the expertise of education researchers that we could conduct multi- ple projects using multiple approaches. It would be a place so hungry for solutions that it would not matter if some projects were quantitative and others were qualitative. It would not mat- ter if some were large-scale and some were small-scale. It would not matter if some paradigms were psychological, some were social, some were economic, and some were cultural. The only thing that would matter in an environment like this would be that education researchers were bringing their expertise to bear on education problems that spoke to pressing concerns of the public. I wonder where we might find such a place? (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! In many cases we ed researchers are fighting nonfights. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n his 1993 AERA Pres- idential Address, “Forms of Understanding and the Future of Educational Research,” Elliot Eisner spoke of representation— not the mental representations discussed in cognitive science, but “the process of transforming the consciousness into a public form so that they can be stabilized, inspected, edited, and shared with others” (p. 6). So we must use our imaginations to construct a set of images that illustrate the debt. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is interesting in that it explores computer-based formative assessment based on traditionally designed item-based test. It applies an interesting technique, Latent Class Analysis/model, to classfy students into different groups. Based on charactersitics of those groups, the system could produce profiles that could inform instruction of teachers.
I think it will be nice to apply LCA in ways of contributing project or the formative assessment project in Hong Kong.
This paper also introduces several interesting concepts and resources for me: latent class analysis (Hagenaars &amp;amp; McCutcheon, 2002); Black and Wiliam (1998) formative assessments, feedback formative cognitive diagnostic assessment?? is it possible?; IRT item response theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the classic studies by Laufer around &lt;em&gt;Lexical Frequency Profile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lexical richness, (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lexical variation. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lexical acquisition research would have to account for the gradual increase in the learner’s vocabulary size, as the most striking difference between the vocabulary of native speakers and that of language learners is in the number of words they can control, particularly in free production: speech or writing. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, longitudinal studies of the development of the productive lexicon are almost non-existent. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ngber(1993), like Linnarud (1986), has examined the relationship between various lexical measures of a piece of writing and holistic scores of writing quality. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more impressive are the results of Astika (1993). The study showed that among five components that contributed to the assessment of writing (content, organization, vocabulary, language use and mechanics), vocabulary accounted for the largest amount of variance in the total scores, a variance of 83.75%. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;let us look at the most popular measures&lt;/strong&gt;: lexical originality,lexical density, lexical sophistication and lexical variation. The Lexical originality index measures the number of words unique to one learner in the test group. If the group changes,the index changes too. An unstable score cannot be considered reliable. Lexical density, which is the percentage of lexical words in the composition, does not necessarily measure lexis proper, since it also depends on thesyntacticandcohesivepropertiesofthecomposition as reflected in the use of function words. Therefore its validity is questionable. Lexical sophistication is the percentage of ’advanced words’ in the text. But the definition of ’advanced’ depends on the researcher and the group that is tested. What is advanced for a learner after 3 years of studies is not advanced after 5 or 7 years. Lexical variation, or type-token ratio,isthemostwidelyusedmeasure. Butahighlexical variation does not necessarily indicate rich vocabulary. This is so because the index distinguishes only between same and different words used in a composition, but not between basic and advanced words as defined by their rarity. Thus, similar variation indices can reflect different vocabulary sizes. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;different measure of lexical richness was devised the Lexical Frequency Profile, hence LFP. The LFP shows the percentage of words that a learner uses at different vocabulary frequency levels in his/her writing, or put differently, the proportion of words from different frequency levels vis a vis one another. The LFP is calculated as follows. Let us imagine a composition which consists of 200 word types, 150 belong to the first 1000 most frequent words, 20 to the second 1000, 20 to the UWL-University World List (Xue Guoyi and Nation 1984) and 10 are not in any list. To calculate the LFP, we convert these numbers (the number of words at each frequency level) into percentages out of the total of 200 word types. The LFP of the composition is therefore 75% 10% 10% 5%. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he validity and reliability of LFP as a research tool were shown by Laufer and Nation (1993). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Questions The specific research questions of the study were as follows: 1. Does the lexical profile of advanced learners’ compositions change over a period of time and how? 2. Does the lexical variation in advanced learners’ compositions change over a period of time and how? 3. Is there a relationship between the changes in the profiles and the changes in the lexical variation in the learners’ writing? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subjects in the study were forty eight first year University studentsinthedepartmentofEnglishLanguageandLiterature. They were graduates of Israeli high schools, i.e. their level of English was similar to that required for the Cambridge First Certificate of English. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data in the study consisted of free compositions written by the learnersatthreepointsoftime. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;orty-eightcompositionsfromtheentrance exam were collected. At the end of the first semester (fourteen weeks), twenty three learners were asked to write the same composition again in the framework of a two-semester Style and Composition course; at the end of the two semesters (twenty eight weeks), the remaining twenty five students were given the composition of the entrance exam. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ll the compositions were analyzed in terms of number of tokens and types in each composition. Therefore a lexical variation index could easily be calculated for each composition. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, pairs of compositions written by the same learners (one at the entrance exam, the other at the end of first or second semester) were compared. Data analysis was as follows: Comparisons of means (paired t-tests) were carried out between the percentages of words at each of the four frequency levels (the 1 st 1000, the 2nd 1000, the UWL and words not in any of the lists), on the entrance exam and at the end of the first semester for group one; the entrance exam and the end of the second semesterforgrouptwo. Comparisonswerealsocarriedoutbetweenthe percentage of words in the four levels vis a vis one another (by MANOVA) for each pair of compositions. Each pair of compositions was also compared on the lexical variation (by paired t-test). Finally, the change in the variation was correlated with the change in lexical profile. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fter one or two semesters the proportion of most frequent words (at the 1 st 1000 level) decreases, the quantity of the words at the 2nd 1000 decreases as well, though less so, the percentage of UWL increases (the increase is statistically significant), and the percentage of ’not in the lists’ words has slightly gone up in group one and has slightly gone down in group 2. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tables Five and Six show that group one progressed in lexical variation, but not significantly so, while group 2 has not progressed at all. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here is no relationship whatsoever between the progress of a student with regard to lexical richness and the change in lexical variation. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the general tendency is for the basic vocabulary to decrease and be replaced by a more advanced vocabulary. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;t first this may seem an indication of the learners’ progress in the productive vocabulary, but the results should be interpreted with some caution. Even if the learners’ vocabulary size has increased, the lexical profile does not come close to the profile of argumentative prose produced by native speakers. A group of 18 year old English native speakers was tested in a different study (Laufer, in preparation) and the percentage of the beyond 2000 words was between 25% and 28%. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second research question related to the changes in lexical variation. Tables Five and Six show that there was no significant change in lexical variation. Moreover,thevariationitselfwaslowcomparedtothevariation of native speakers who are high school graduates. The lexical variation in their compositions was found to be 70% (Linnarud 1983). Therefore, if one aspect of vocabulary learning is improving one’s ability to vary his/ her vocabulary, not much learning has taken place in the case of the learners in our study. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A encyclopedia entry about Lexical Frequency Profiles. Laufer explains the assumption, concepts, and tools nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assumption: A large number of infrequent words would make a text more difficult to understand. More advanced learners could use a higher percentage of infrequent vocabulary than learners of lower proficiencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concepts: &lt;em&gt;Knowledge&lt;/em&gt; is taken to be the information about a word which is stored and interconnected in the mental lexicon. &lt;em&gt;Use&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, is the choice of speakers or writers to put their lexical knowledge into practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/staff/paul-nation.aspx&#34;&gt;Range&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lognostics.co.uk/tools/index.htm&#34;&gt;P_lex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we know that people use rich and sophisticated vocabulary in their writing? (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laufer and Nation (1995) proposed that the vocabulary richness of a text could be measured by a quantitative index called the lexical frequency profile (LFP) which uses the proportion of frequent versus nonfrequent vocabulary in the text. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The index can be calculated by a special computer program, Range, available on Paul Nation’s homepage (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/staff/paul-nation.aspx&#34;&gt;http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/staff/paul-nation.aspx&lt;/a&gt;) (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic assumption was that a large number of infrequent words would make a text more difficult to understand. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found that the LFP was stable for compositions written by the same students on different topics, as long as these were of a general nature and did not involve infrequently used jargon words. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also found that the profile discriminated between learners of different language proficiencies. More advanced learners could use a higher percentage of infrequent vocabulary than learners of lower proficiencies. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, a more detailed lexical profile can be performed using the Range program on Nation’s site or VocabProfile BNC 20 on Cobb’s site. The text is matched against 20 frequency lists which were developed on the basis of the British National Corpus (BNC). The resulting analysis shows the number and the percentage of words at each 1,000 of the 20 lists of 20 thousands words. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LFP is basically a measure of lexical use in writing, which can be distinguished from lexical knowledge. Knowledge is taken to be the information about a word which is stored and interconnected in the mental lexicon, for example, the spoken and written form, grammatical properties, different meanings, and connections with other words. Use, on the other hand, is the choice of speakers or writers to put their lexical knowledge into practice. In particular, use should be distinguished from active knowledge. Active knowledge is associated with speaking and writing and implies that we can retrieve the appropriate spoken or written word form when prompted to do so. For example, when asked to translate an L1 word into L2, we are asked to demonstrate our active knowledge. Use, however, has to do with producing words at one’s free will, as is the case of a composition. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, LFP is one of the quantitative measures of lexical proficiency. There are additional quantitative measures that test other aspects of lexical proficiency: passive vocabulary size, for example, Nation and Beglar (2007), active vocabulary size, for example, Laufer and Nation (1999), both passive and active (Laufer &amp;amp; Goldstein, 2004; Laufer, Elder, Hill, &amp;amp; Congdon, 2004), and speed of meaning recognition (Laufer &amp;amp; Nation, 2001). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another profile of lexis is P_Lex developed by Paul Meara and available for use online (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lognostics.co.uk/tools/index.htm&#34;&gt;http://www.lognostics.co.uk/tools/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;). The profile is similar to the LFP in its underlying assumptions (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is different from the LFP in several respects. Infrequent vocabulary is considered vocabulary that is not in the first most common 1,000 words. The analysis is performed by dividing a text into segments of 10 words each, calculating the number of beyond 1,000 words for each segment and turning these data into a single figure known as the lambda. A higher lambda indicates a higher proportion of infrequent words (for the mathematics of calculating the lambda, see Meara &amp;amp; Bell, 2001). P_Lex is also claimed to work well with shorter texts than those suggested for the LFP analysis, that is, texts shorter than 200 words. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two major shortcomings of lexical profiles. First, they do not distinguish between homonyms (words with unrelated meanings, e.g., “bank,” “pupil”) and yet different meanings may belong to different frequency bands. Second, the profiles do not “recognize” multi-word units such as “as a matter of fact,” “of course,” “make up one’s mind.” Instead of listing them as single units, the profilers decompose them into separate words, for example, “of” and “course.” (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key questions include: ■ What does computational thinking for youth look like in practice? ■ How can we support growth in computational thinking, both in and out of school? (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION Computational thinking (CT) is a term coined by Jeannette Wing [11] to describe a set of thinking skills, habits and approaches that are integral to solving complex problems using a computer and widely applicable in the information society. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CT involves defining, understanding, and solving problems, reasoning at multiple levels of abstraction, understanding and applying automation, and analyzing the appropriateness of the abstractions made. CT shares elements with various other types of thinking such as algorithmic thinking, engineering thinking, design thinking, and mathematical thinking. As such, CT draws on a rich legacy of related frameworks as it extends previous thinking skills. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found the terms of abstraction, automation, and analysis [3] to be useful for understanding how youth can use CT to approach novel problems. Abstraction is “the process of generalizing from specific instances.” In problem solving, abstraction may take the form of stripping down a problem to what is believed to be its bare essentials. Abstraction is also commonly defined as the capturing of common characteristics or actions into one set that can be used to represent all other instances. Automation is a labor saving process in which a computer is instructed to execute a set of repetitive tasks quickly and efficiently compared to the processing power of a human. In this light, computer programs are “automations of abstractions.” Analysis is a reflective practice that refers to the validation of whether the abstractions made were correct. One might ask “Were the right assumptions made when narrowing the problem to its bare essentials?”, “Were important factors left out?” or “Was the implementation of the abstraction or automation faulty?” (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1 Modeling and Simulation (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave Moursund [6] suggests “the underlying idea in computational thinking is developing models and simulations of problems that one is trying to study and solve.” In Project GUTS (Growing up Thinking Scientifically) middle school students actively engage in computational thinking as they design and implement models of local relevance and then use the models to run simulations. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2 Three-stage Progression “Use-Modify-Create” (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This progression, called Use-Modify-Create, describes a pattern of engagement (see Figure 5) that was seen to support and deepen youth’s acquisition of CT in the authors’ NSF projects. It is based on the premise that scaffolding increasingly deep interactions will promote the acquisition and development of CT. In the use stage, students are consumers of someone else’s creation. For example, they run experiments using pre-existing computer models, run a program that controls a robot, or play a ready-made computer game. Over time they begin to modify the model, game or program with increasing levels of sophistication. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computational thinking projects like these support an iterative cycle of refinement that enables increasing a sense of agency, where learners are empowered to imagine, create, play, share, and reflect on what they are learning [9]. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3SUPPORTING GROWTH IN COMPUTATIONAL THINKING (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Rich Computational Environments (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich computational environments are ones in which the underlying abstractions and mechanisms can be inspected, manipulated and customized. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving through this progression, it is important to maintain a level of challenge that supports growth while limiting anxiety. As Repenning [8] notes, students can maintain their sense of cognitive flow [1] as they progress iteratively through a series of projects. In this work, students tackle progressively higher design challenges as their skills and capacities increase. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3 Other Domains (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EcoScienceWorks (ESW) is a program in Maine that leverages the State’s one-to-one laptop initiative to engage students with environmental simulations as part of the school day science curriculum. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first key point is that existing definitions of CT can be applied to K-12 settings. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the field requires systematic assessment procedures that build on existing research from the learning sciences in order to describe the developmental progression of these three CT constructs. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second key point is that CT takes place on a continuum. The use-modify-create progression is offered as a framework for educators and researchers that are looking at how CT develops (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper builds on existing efforts to describe the scope and nature of CT [7] as well as the concepts involved in CT and how youth should be able to use those concepts [2]. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting study exploring the relationships between &lt;em&gt;perceived closeness&lt;/em&gt; between students and their actual &lt;em&gt;interactions on blogs&lt;/em&gt;. Some explanations of SNA are questionable, so are the interpretation of several SNA results. For instance, comparisons of network measures over time should come after an explicit explanation of network construction (e.g., sliding window, accumulation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study examines the social network of the learner relationships and online interactions in a graduate course using weblogs for writing and sharing weekly reflective journals during a 16-week semester. The social network data of the learner relationships were gathered twice by measuring learners&amp;rsquo; perceived emotional closeness with other learners. In terms of the online interactions among the learners, the numbers of replies that individual learners had posted to and received from others&amp;rsquo; postings were respectively calculated and analyzed. The findings from these measures indicated that the social network patterns and values as measured by peer relationships were noticeably changed at the end of the semester, when compared to that at the beginning. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review of empirical studies of blogs (Sim &amp;amp; Hew, 2010) reported that there have been two major research topics in this field: (1) describing the usage profile of blogs, and (2) examining the effects of blogging. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, learning psychologists have found that the more learners reflect and elaborate on newly learned content, the more they will remember later (Driscoll, 2005). (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the current study is two-fold. First, the researchers sought to describe the network structure of the learner relationships in terms of perceived closeness and online interactions (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, they attempted to identify any relationships that existed between the degree of perceived closeness and that of social interactions. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse still, as indicated, such course hub sites are often unavailable after the course ends or taken offline after a few years. Compounding the problem, it is not uncommon for an institution to switch to a new LMS system. When this happens, all the previous learner contributions and indications of learning are wiped clean as the system is taken offline. As a result, any powerful learning episodes vanish or may no longer be accessible. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did the social network structure of peer relationships change between at the beginning and at the end of the course using blogs? 2. How did the social network of online interactions form through blogging? 3. Isthereasignificantrelationshipbetweentheonlineinteractionsand the peer relationships? (p. 36)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, individually owned blogs are lasting and accessible until a user decides to close her blog. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literature review (p. 36)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1. Blogs: individual publishing system with sense of ownership (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ownership of a blog also shifts the balance of power and control in a course to the learners (Kang, Bonk, &amp;amp; Kim, 2011). (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentally, the read-write Web dramatically enhances the power of individuals and fosters a participatory culture of building, tinkering, learning, and sharing (Brown, 2006). (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Interaction and peer relationship in blogs (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactivity is regarded as critical to the success of social network systems (Williams &amp;amp; Jacobs, 2004). (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4. Social network analysis (SNA) in education (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A social network can be defined as “a specific set of linkages among a defined set of persons” (Wasserman &amp;amp; Faust, 1994, p. 2). Social network analysis (SNA) is the analytical method of social networks, which views social networks as relationships in a group, consisting of nodes (agents) and links (relationship). (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, interaction does not guarantee positive educational goals. The quality of interactions often matter. Cutler (1995) said “the more one discloses personal information, the more others will reciprocate and the more individuals know about each other, the more likely they are to establish trust, seek support, and thus find satisfaction” (p. 326). Tinto (1993) observes social interaction positively affects persistence in college. Interaction among learners supports the learning process (Rovai, 2002) and learning takes place through the sharing of purposeful activity (Lave &amp;amp; Wenger, 1991). In addition, Dawson (2006) found that students with frequent interaction possess stronger sense of community. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNA has commonly been used as a major data analysis method in educational research to illustrate different variables such as relationship, emotion, help, and other social phenomena. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNA does not deal with attribute data of individuals, but with relational data “that cannot be reduced to the properties of the individual agents themselves (Scott, 2013, p. 3).” It is believed that social structures are built from relations. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is argued that good peer relationships provide individuals with social support and belongingness that can foster deeper and richer learning experiences (Rogers, 1983). In short, peer relationships contribute to academic performance indirectly by way of motivation and emotional support. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Blogging for reflection (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflection fosters the transfer of learning (Bouldin, Holmes, &amp;amp; Fortenberry, 2006). (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methodology (p. 37)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A software tool called NetMiner 4 was used to analyze the social network of peer relationships and online interactions (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.3. Coreness in the peer closeness network (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figs. 4 and 5 display the coreness maps at the beginning and end of the course, respectively. In Fig. 4 the nodes located in the core at the start of the semester were all students majoring in instructional systems technology. Not surprisingly, they were relatively closer than the others in the visual depiction. However, at the end of the semester, as displayed in Fig. 5, other than three students (AJY, BHK, JBS), most students became located close to the core. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results (p. 40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of peer relationship, the network density in the second week was 0.17 (# of links = 78), which indicates a loosely tied network (see Fig. 2). The network density value measured in the final week increased to 0.62 (# of links = 285), which revealed that the students had become much more strongly tied to each other (see Fig. 3). (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNCLEAR&lt;br /&gt;
 unclear whether the links were accumulated throughout the course. If so, this increase tells nothing. The numbers will naturally grow given more student interactions. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.6. Correlation between online interactions and peer closeness perceived (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, all the centrality values regarding online interactions and peer closeness were statistically significant (see Table 6). (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A paired t-test was used to determine if there was any statistically significant difference between the beginning and final weeks in terms of degree centrality values about peer closeness. Significant differences in peer closeness were found in both in-degree (t = −.16.83, p b .01) and out-degree (t = −8.30, p b .01) values (see Table 4). The overall centrality of individual students significantly increased from the beginning. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusion and discussion (p. 42)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several key findings of this study have wide ranging implications for instructors designing online courses using blogs. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2. Future directions (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future studies might explore the correlation between social network values of peer relationships and individual students&amp;rsquo; academic achievement. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rovai and Jordan (2004) provided empirical evidence that blended courses produce a stronger sense of community than either face-toface or fully online courses. However, several students in the present study reported that they experienced that close feeling with other peers online through blogging but that it has not transferred to the face-to-face classrooms. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By examining intersections between learning of science and learning of language, the article identifies key features of the language of the science classroom as students engage in these language-intensive science and engineering practices. We propose that when students, especially English language learners, are adequately supported to “do” spe- cific things with language, both science learning and language learning are promoted. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article discusses language learning challenges and oppor- tunities that will emerge as ELLs engage with NGSS. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 Three Dimensions of the Science Framework (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement in any of the science and engineering practices involves both scientific sense-making and language use. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement in these practices is also lan - guage intensive. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(no. 2) developing and using models, (no. 6) constructing explanations (for science) and designing solutions (for engineering), (no. 7) engaging in argu- ment from evidence, and (no. 8) obtaining, evaluating, and com- municating information. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Generation Science Standards with a Focus on Science and Engineering Practices (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Framework defines science learning as having three dimen- sions: (a) science and engineering practices, (b) crosscutting con- cepts, and &amp;copy; core ideas in each science discipline (see Table 1). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the term inquiry-based sci- ence is refined and deepened by the explicit definition of the set of science and engineering practices. These practices are pre- sented both as a representation of what scientists do as they engage in scientific inquiry and as a necessary part of what stu- dents must do both to learn science and to understand the nature of science. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, these practices are language intensive and require stu- dents to engage in classroom science discourse (see literature review by G. Kelly, 2007). Students must read, write, view, and visually represent as they develop their models and explanations. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, these practices are generally less familiar to many sci- ence teachers and require shifts for science teaching (Windschitl, Thompson, &amp;amp; Braaten, 2011). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the requirement for classroom discourse and the norms for this behavior are to a great extent common across all the science disciplines, and indeed across all the subject areas. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, as science classrooms incorporate the discourse-rich science and engineering practices described in the Framework, they will become richer language learning environments as well as richer science learning environments for all students. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;intervention studies to support teachers’ and students’ use of discourse and social practice in developing scientific under- standing and engaging in scientific practices. For example, Engle and Conant (2002) identified four principles to foster productive disciplinary engagement in the classroom: problematizing con- tent, giving students authority, holding students accountable to others and to disciplinary norms, and providing relevant resources. In a similar line of research, Cornelius and Herrenkohl (2004) mapped students’ epistemological development in science onto the dynamic interactions of talk, text, other representations, and social interactions that took place in science classrooms. As another line of research, Windschitl et al. (2011) developed dis- course tools and scaffolding to support novice science teachers in developing elements of expertlike teaching, with the greatest gains made in pressing their students for evidence-based scientific explanations through modeling and representations of challeng- ing science concepts. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language in Science Learning and Teaching (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;teachers need a nuanced view of how language is used to construct and commu- nicate meaning in science. Contemporary research on language in science learning and teaching highlights what students and teachers do with language as they engage in science inquiry and discourse practices (see literature review by Carlsen, 2007; G. Kelly, 2007). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemic Functional Linguistics Perspective (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemic functional linguistics provides one perspective on how language is used in science learning. Halliday and Martin (1993) framed what they termed “the linguistic register”3 of science class- room communication as a resource for meaning-making, not as a rigid set of conventions or a system of rules to be learned. Halliday (2002) argued that students must develop and under- stand the linguistic tools for meaning-making in science as com- prising a unique linguistic register. This register provides tools for understanding what people are doing, what their relations are to each other, and how they are using language in the context of making scientific meaning. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language in Science Learning with ELLs (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another area of research on language in science learning has focused on students who have traditionally been marginalized in science, including ELLs. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halliday and Matthiessen (2004) argued that science and everyday discourse are dialogi- cally complementary, interrelated, and synergistic and represent a fundamental continuity that provides different ways of depict- ing a common reality. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work focuses on the linguistic, cultural, concep - tual, and imaginative resources that ELLs bring to the science classroom that can serve as intellectual resources for learning scien- tific knowledge and practices. In another longstanding line of research, Lee and colleagues (e.g., Lee, Buxton, Lewis, &amp;amp; LeRoy, 2006; Lee &amp;amp; Fradd, 1998) highlighted the importance of develop- ing congruence between students’ cultural and linguistic experi- ences and the specific demands of particular academic disciplines such as science. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discourse and Social Practice in the Science Classroom (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how discourse becomes part of the social practice of the science classroom (see literature review by G. Kelly, 2007). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lemke (1990) argued that discourse should be seen as “differenti- ated speech” that different groups of people and texts bring to science. For Lemke, the greatest challenge science teachers face is how to support students in building connections across differen- tiated speech forms, from everyday language to disciplinary dis- course. In a similar vein, Gee (1990) proposed that to become competent users of the genre of classroom science discourse (which he distinguished from the genre of research science discourse), students must adopt certain communicative practices, such as those accepted for evaluating claims (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Standards and Second Language Acquisition with ELLs (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories of Second Language Acquisition and Pedagogy (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;second language acquisition (SLA) (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we present a brief discussion of first and second lan- guages and their acquisition that emphasizes pragmatic, textual, and sociolinguistic competencies in SLA (Bachman, 1990; Canale &amp;amp; Swain, 1980). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doing” Things With Language (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children naturally acquire both the ability to use language and implicit knowledge about not only the structure of that language (e.g., the sound patterns of words, the order of words) but also the conventions (e.g., when to speak or not speak and what to say to whom). By the time they arrive in school, children are skilled users of the variety of language functions used in their home and community. They can do many things with language. For exam- ple, they can argue with their siblings, complain, disagree, ask and answer questions, and make their needs and feelings known. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second language pedagogy. Over 25 centuries of second language teaching (L. G. Kelly, 1969), there have been a series of pendu- lum shifts, debates, innovations, and controversies. In general, research on second language teaching (Ellis, 2005; Norris &amp;amp; Ortega, 2000, 2006) has been carried out primarily with adults in post-secondary settings. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students who are referred to as ELLs arrive at school with a well-established first language but at many different levels of English language development. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;second language pedago - gies can generally be classified as following one of two approaches: the structural and the experiential (Stern, 1990). Structural approaches based on traditional or mainstream SLA focus on “teaching” specific language elements (e.g., vocabulary, pronun- ciation, grammatical forms) (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when supported appropriately, most ELLs are capable of learning subjects such as science through their emerging language and of comprehending and car- rying out sophisticated language functions (e.g., arguing from evidence, providing explanations) using less-than-perfect English. They can do a number of things using whatever level of English they have and can participate in science and engineering prac- tices. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiential approaches to teaching language, adopted in this article, are based on the socially oriented view of SLA. These approaches focus on supporting students’ ability to do things with language, engaging them in purposeful activities, and pro- viding them with opportunities for language use. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we argue for two shifts: (a) a shift away from both content-based language instruction and the sheltered model to a focus on language-in-use environments and (b) a shift away from “teaching” discrete language skills to a focus on supporting language development by providing appropriate contexts and experiences. We envision science teachers who create carefully planned classrooms where students engage in science and engi- neering practices, such as evidence-based arguments and explana- tions of phenomena or systems. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intersections between Learning of Science and Learning of Language (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we identify key features of the language of the sci- ence classroom as students engage in language-intensive science and engineering practices. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language of the Science Classroom: Moving Toward Disciplinary Language of Science (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content-Based Language Instruction (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content-based language instruction, at its best, integrates the teaching of language and the teaching of academic subjects (Scarcella, 2003; Schleppegrell, 2004; Snow, 2001). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If science teachers are to engage ELLs in science and engineering practices, they must have a clear understanding of the ways that students and teachers use oral and written language to interact with each other and to obtain information from writ- ten materials. They must monitor individual students’ language use to ensure that all students are comprehending the discourse and participating in it. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we introduce the term language of the science classroom that includes the registers (i.e., styles of talk) used in the science classroom by teachers and students as they participate in aca- demic tasks and activities and demonstrate their knowledge in oral or written forms.5 Language of the science classroom is grounded in colloquial or everyday language but moves toward the disciplinary language of science. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the grade level advances, written materials intended for learners tend to mirror disciplinary language more closely. Our intent is to be explicit about what science teachers and their students “do” with lan- guage in their classrooms. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2 presents the four selected (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 3 Language of the Science Classroom (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;science and engineering practices, types of analytical tasks that students engage in for each practice, and receptive (listening/ reading) and productive (speaking/writing) language functions (see CCSSO, 2012, for all eight practices). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;language use: modality, registers, and examples of registers in an attempt to move beyond simple definitions of “the language of science” as vocabulary or grammatical correctness. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language serves as the vehicle to perform analytical tasks and ultimately to construct knowledge. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 3 focuses on the language of the science classroom itself and, in column 1, highlights three key elements of classroom (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions and Implications (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across these three subject areas, the new standards share a common emphasis on disciplinary practices and classroom discourse (see Figure 1). As engagement in these practices is language intensive, it presents both language demands and opportunities for all students, espe- cially ELLs. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the richness of science and engineering practices, NGSS will lead to science classrooms that are also rich language learning environments for ELLs. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view is consistent with contemporary litera - ture on language in science learning and teaching that highlights what students and teachers do with language as they engage in science inquiry and discourse practices (Carlsen, 2007; G. Kelly, 2007). This view is also consistent with current theories of SLA that emphasize what learners can do with language—the socially oriented (rather than individually oriented) view of SLA and the experiential (rather than structural) pedagogies. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although content-based language instruction, sheltered instruction, and academic language instruction are valuable attempts to bring together subject matter instruction and second language instruction, their predominant emphases have been on the study and practice of language elements rather than on immersion in rich environments that use language for sense- making. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also stress the value of attention to the language of the science classroom that moves toward the disciplin- ary language of science (see Table 3). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the contrary, we argue that NGSS can provide a context where science learning and language learn- ing can occur simultaneously. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike pre-CCSS standards developed within each subject area, the new standards highlight connections across subject areas (Stage, Asturias, Cheuk, Daro, &amp;amp; Hampton, 2013). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ELA is traditionally associated with literary texts, the CCSS emphasize informational texts (Pearson, 2013) (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Smith introduced a student writing assignment, which began with the prompt, “Write your opinion on &amp;hellip; .” This caught my attention, as the use of opinion would be problematic in the science classroom. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is to initiate a dialogue about the promise and challenge of implementing the CCSS and the NGSS in light of key convergences and discrepancies that appear across the two sets of standards. Specifically, I examine how the two sets of standards as policy documents address a foundational disciplinary practice: argument. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Literature on Argument in ELA/ Literacy and Science Education (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two terms can be defined to include both an individual or structural meaning and a social or dialogic meaning (Jiménez-Aleixandre &amp;amp; Erduran, 2007; McNeill, 2011). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argument is typically defined as a product or structure based on Toulmin’s (1958) argument pattern consisting of data, claim, warrant, backing, and rebuttal. Argumentation is typically defined as a process or interactions between individuals exchanging evidence to convince each other of the validity of their claims. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My analysis focuses on how discipline-specific views of what counts as argument (i.e., disciplinary norms) and when develop- mentally argument is expected (i.e., developmental progressions) are reflected in each set of standards. As both sets of standards claim to be research based, I preface my analysis of the standards documents with a survey of relevant literature in ELA/literacy and science education with an attempt to identify conceptual sources of convergences and discrepancies between the two sets of standards. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important issue in ELA/literacy education (which is largely absent in science education literature) involves genres of communication (Gillespie, Olinghouse, &amp;amp; Graham, 2013; Klein &amp;amp; Rose, 2010). In the past, the focus has been on persuasion, for example, the NAEP framework’s focus on persuasive writing over the grades (NGA Center &amp;amp; CCSSO, 2010a). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;owever, as one of the most important shifts in the CCSS involves an express emphasis on logical or evidence-based argument as opposed to persuasive argument (NGA Center &amp;amp; CCSSO, 2010b), (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to first make some general observations about the scope of the research literature on argument in ELA/literacy and science education. The literature is extensive in science edu- cation as argument is a major research program. Since 2000, sev- eral comprehensive reviews of literature address a range of topics related to argument (Bricker &amp;amp; Bell, 2008; Cavagnetto, 2010; Driver, Newton, &amp;amp; Osborne, 2000; Duschl, 2008; Ford, 2008; Manz, 2015; Sadler, 2004; Sampson &amp;amp; Clark, 2008). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newell et al. (2011) state that “in con- trast to simply attempting to persuade someone to believe or do something, evidence-based argumentation involves making a claim supported by reasons or evidence from multiple sources that connects to the claims in a principled way” (p. 275) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the literature on argument in ELA/lit- eracy education is limited, with one only major review by Newell, Beach, Smith, and VanDerHeide (2011). Newell et al. highlight that there is a “rather limited number of empirical studies of argu- mentative reading and writing in English language arts/reading” (p. 275). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;modalities of communication, especially speaking ver- sus writing. Felton and Herko (2004) point out a gap between persuasive speaking versus writing. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner, Bereiter and Scardamalia (1982; Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 1986) point out that even though there are differences in children’s oral and written production of narration, there is an even greater difference in their ability to produce oral and writ- ten arguments in the absence of conversational partners. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disciplinary Norms of Argument (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even young children can produce arguments in writing as well as orally (D. D. Anderson, 2008; Riley &amp;amp; Reedy, 2005 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newell et al. (2011) consider the contributions of two disciplinary perspectives in argumentative reading and writing. A cognitive perspective examines use of argument strategies (e.g., claim, evidence, rebuttal), whereas a social perspective focuses on how learners acquire social prac- tices through interactions in sociocultural contexts. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for reviews of a range of theoretical conceptualizations of argumentation, see Bricker &amp;amp; Bell, 2008 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erduran, Simon, and Osborne (2004) used a simplified version of the model in which an argument was broken down into three com- ponents: (a) a claim (or conclusion), (b) the data (supporting the claim), and &amp;copy; a warrant linking the data to the claim. McNeill and Krajcik (2009) conceptualized these three com- ponents as a claim, evidence, and reasoning. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major issue involves argumentation as social prac- tices in the classroom community (see literature reviews by Cavagnetto, 2010; Ford, 2008; Manz, 2015; also see Engle, Langer- Osuna, &amp;amp; McKinney de Royston, 2014). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third major issue involves argumentation as epistemic practices, which are defined as “those that ground authority for knowing in the discipline” (Manz, 2015, p. 553; also see reviews in Bricker &amp;amp; Bell, 2008; Ford &amp;amp; Forman, 2006). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature traditionally presupposes that elementary stu- dents are not capable of engaging in argumentation on the grounds it is too abstract for them and beyond their self-centered or egocentric view. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending argumentation as social practices to argumentation as epistemic practices, current research asserts that engaging students in doing what scientists do when they argue constitutes an initiation into scientific argumentation. However, there are differences in how scientists and students enact argumentation. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while elementary students have an understanding of narration, students across K–12 have difficulty with argument writing (Bereiter &amp;amp; Scardamalia, 1982; Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 1986). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developmental studies on argument writing across elementary, middle, and high school levels consistently indicate that elementary students were less effective in using claims, data, and warrants (Knudson, 1991, 1992; McCann, 1989) and taking alternative or audience perspectives (Ferretti, Lewis, &amp;amp; Andrews-Weckerly, 2009; Ferretti, MacArthur, &amp;amp; Dowdy, 2000; Golder &amp;amp; Coirier, 1994). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth major issue involves the role of science content knowledge for argumentation. If students do not understand a given science concept, they are unable to construct a scientifically accurate claim related to that concept or justify that claim. Thus, the quality and accuracy of students’ argu- ments are influenced by both their understanding of the struc- ture of an argument and their knowledge of science content (McNeill, 2011; McNeill, Lizotte, Krajcik, &amp;amp; Marx, 2006; Sampson &amp;amp; Clark, 2008). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While there is a significant body of literature on argument writing with older students &amp;hellip; there is little attention to this issue in elementary school classrooms and a virtual invisibility of young children’s engagement with the genre” (Ghiso, 2015, p. 191), and “relatively few of the interven- tions reported on at the elementary level have focused on the evidence-based logical argumentation emphasized in the CCSS” (O’Hallaron, 2014, p. 305). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One significant line of research is that of R. C. Anderson and colleagues, who engage third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students in “collaborative reasoning” designed to pro- mote argumentative discourse, reading, and writing (R. C. Anderson et al., 2001; Jadallah et al., 2011; Reznitskaya, Anderson, &amp;amp; Kuo, 2007; Zhang et al., 2016). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developmental Progressions (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, emerging interven- tion research on scientific argumentation with elementary stu- dents at intermediate grade levels consistently indicates that these students are able to engage in argumentation (Berland &amp;amp; McNeill, 2010; Cavagnetto et al., 2010; Chen, Wang, Lu, Lin, &amp;amp; Hong, 2016; Hong, Lin, Wang, Chen, &amp;amp; Yang, 2013; Maloney &amp;amp; Simon, 2006; McNeill, 2011; Ryu &amp;amp; Sandoval, 2012; Songer &amp;amp; Gotwals, 2012). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recent studies also challenge the developmental general- ization by showing that elementary students, including children as young as first graders, are capable of constructing arguments. The results consistently indicate that provided with effective instruction, elementary students are intellectually able to grasp the complexity of an issue and can develop an argument in a sophisticated way (D. D. Anderson, 2008; Ghiso, 2015; Gilbert &amp;amp; Graham, 2010; Gillespie et al., 2013; O’Hallaron, 2014; Riley &amp;amp; Reedy, 2005). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two major literature reviews on chil- dren’s scientific thinking and reasoning, including argument, pro- vided the conceptual grounding for the Framework (NRC, 2012) and subsequently the NGSS. Both reviews portray children as com- ing to school with rich knowledge of the natural world and com- plex reasoning that afford a solid foundation for learning science. One literature review (Metz, 1995) points out that in contrast to a commonly held view of children as concrete and simplistic think- ers, their thinking is surprisingly sophisticated, and they deploy a wide range of reasoning processes. The other literature review, Ta k - ing Science to School (NRC, 2007), highlights that children come to school “with the cognitive capacity to engage in serious ways with the enterprise of science” (p. vii) and that “important building blocks for learning science are in place before they enter school” (p. 53). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it has become clear in this section, argument has been addressed in ELA/literacy and science education separately, and thus there are no cross-disciplinary conceptual or empirical stud- ies on argument between the two subject areas. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Metz (1995) and NRC (2007) reviews emphasize the importance of scaffold-rich curricular and instructional support from teachers as they engage students in scientific tasks that are meaningful to the students. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, science education researchers have acknowl- edged that children often make unsupported claims about scien- tific phenomena, ignore or distort evidence that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs, and provide unsubstantiated reasoning (Furtak, Hardy, Beinbrech, Shavelson, &amp;amp; Shemwell, 2010; Hardy, Kloetzer, Moeller, &amp;amp; Sodian, 2010). Even in secondary school, establishing a classroom culture of rigorous scientific rea- soning and argument can be challenging to achieve (Osborne, Erduran, &amp;amp; Simon, 2004). Moreover, the priority given to argu- mentation supported by evidence can inhibit conceptually rich talk to construct explanations in middle school science class- rooms (Shemwell &amp;amp; Furtak, 2010). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCSS and the NGSS on Argument (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I examine the CCSS and NGSS documents related to argument, pointing out key similarities and differences that emerge across these two sets of standards in terms of disciplinary norms of argument (i.e., What counts as argument?) and developmental progressions of children’s ability to engage in argument (i.e., When are children capable of engaging in argument?). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it is an entirely new endeavor for ELA to extend argument to different disci- plines, including science. Second, the CCSS emphasize the role of evidence as a critical feature of argument independent of the discipline (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disciplinary Norms of Argument (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCSS for ELA/literacy. The CCSS define argument as “a rea- soned, logical way of demonstrating that the writer’s position, belief, or conclusion is valid” (NGA Center &amp;amp; CCSSO, 2010b, p. 23). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, in underscoring the cross-disciplinary significance of evidence, the CCSS make a point of qualifying that “different disciplines call for different types of evidence” (NGA Center &amp;amp; CCSSO, 2010a, p. 7). However, the CCSS do not venture to specify the precise nature of these differences beyond broad descriptors such as “evidence from the text” in ELA or “data in a scientifically acceptable form” in science. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because an argument deals with whether the main claim is true, it demands empirical descriptive evidence, statistics, or definitions for support. When writing an argument, the writer supports his or her claim(s) with sound reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence. (NGA Center &amp;amp; CCSSO, 2010b, p. 23) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NGSS. The Framework (NRC, 2012) describes Practice 7, “engaging in argument from evidence,” as follows: The study of science and engineering should produce a sense of the process of argument necessary for advancing and defending a new idea or an explanation of a phenomenon and the norms for conducting such arguments. In that spirit, students should argue for the explanations they construct, defend their interpretations of the associated data, and advocate for the designs they propose. (p. 73) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCSS describe many purposes of arguments—“to change the reader’s point of view, to bring about some action on the reader’s part, or to ask the reader to accept the writer’s expla- nation or evaluation of a concept, issue, or problem” (NGA Center &amp;amp; CCSSO, 2010b, p. 23). Then, the CCSS distinguish between persuasive arguments and logical arguments, noting that whereas a persuasive argument relies principally on “the emotions the writing evokes in the audience or the character or credentials of the writer,” a logical argument “convinces the audience because of the perceived merit and reasonableness of the claims and proofs offered” (NGA Center &amp;amp; CCSSO, 2010b, p. 24). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;noting that “the nature of an effective argu- ment and what counts as evidence is specific to each subject” (NRC, 2015, p. 31). Just as with the CCSS, however, the NGSS make no attempt to articulate what these cross-disciplinary vari- ations entail. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCSS describe argument in sci- ence, which is comparable to how the Framework (NRC, 2012) and the NGSS describe argument in science. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developmental Progressions (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCSS for ELA/literacy articulate a devel- opmental trajectory: “As students advance through the grades and master the standards in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language, they are able to exhibit with increasing fullness and regularity these capacities of the literate individual” (NGA Center &amp;amp; CCSSO, 2010a, p. 7). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;both the Framework (NRC, 2012) and the NGSS prioritize “developing students’ proficiency in science in a coherent way across grades K–12 following the logic of learning progressions” (NRC, 2012, p. 33). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary. The NGSS characterization of young children’s ability to engage in argument seems to contradict that of the CCSS in both subtle and obvious ways. First, the CCSS view children’s ability to engage in argument as being limited in Grades K–5 and as developing to full capacity in Grades 6–8, whereas the NGSS view children as being able to engage in argument from kinder- garten. Second, the CCSS use opinion to refer to the developing form of argument, whereas the NGSS expect young children to distinguish evidence from opinion. Third, the CCSS introduce evidence for Grade 3 and claim for Grade 5, whereas the NGSS expect young children starting from kindergarten to include evidence in supporting their claim. While the CCSS consider opinions as a “developing form of argument,” the expectation that students provide evidence regularly starting at Grade 4 and make claims regularly starting at Grade 6 suggests that K–5 stu- dents do not engage in evidence-based argumentation. When the aforementioned three points are taken together, the CCSS portray children as gradually becoming capable of engaging in arguments from evidence over the span of Grades 3–8, whereas the NGSS portray children as capable of engaging in arguments from evidence from kindergarten. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a developmental perspective (i.e., when children are capable of engaging in argument), argument and associated con- structs are introduced at different grade levels or grade bands across the CCSS and the NGSS, especially in Grades K–5. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequences for Classroom Teaching (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, neither the standards docu- ments nor the research literature offer substantive insights into the precise nature of these differences or the consequences of such differences on classroom teaching across subject areas. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendations for Educational Policies and Research Agenda (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to cross-disciplinary collaboration could involve a research forum consisting of stakeholder groups, including disciplinary experts, educational researchers, teachers, writers of standards, and policymakers across ELA/literacy and science education. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach could involve a systematic, comprehen- sive, and integrative review of literature (for which the literature review section in this article could serve as a point of departure). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers need informed guidance about how to go about resolving these discrepancies. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still another approach could involve researchers and teach- ers working closely together for classroom research on curricu- lum, instruction, and assessment (e.g., Penuel, Fishman, Cheng, &amp;amp; Sabelli, 2011). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assisting teachers and policymakers, the education research community could play a key role. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As envisioned in the new standards, researchers across ELA/lit- eracy and science education should engage in cross-disciplinary col- laboration to address how to capitalize on convergences and resolve discrepancies between the two sets of standards and between the two bodies of research literature. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I concur with Pearson (2013) that while supporting the CCSS and the NGSS, these standards “will prove to be ‘living Standards’ that will be revised regularly so that they are always based on our most current knowledge” (p. 258). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to propose three interrelated areas of research activitie (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin, J.-W., &amp;amp; Lai, Y.-C. (2013). Online formative assessments with social network awareness. Computers &amp;amp; Education, 66, 40–53. doi:10.1016/j.compedu.2013.02.008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper reports an interesting SNA-based system that recommend peer helpers based on friendship statuses (&amp;lsquo;social context&amp;rsquo; as called by the authors) and results of &amp;lsquo;formative assessment&amp;rsquo; (i.e., results of a formative test; &amp;lsquo;knowledge context&amp;rsquo; as called by the authors). The tool, SNAFA, engages students in 1) self-report information including friendship statuses, 2) take a test, and 3) review recommended peer helpers to seek help. The design is novel in that it combines both social and knowledge contexts. (However, the results might be a bit thin because some causal claims made in this paper might fit better with correlation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;his study focuses on being aware both peer’s social context and knowledge context for student to promote the opportunity of peer interaction and to select the appropriate helpers to ask for help when facing problems in online assessments. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corresponding system, called Social Network Awareness for Formative Assessments (SNAFA), is further developed. The education experiments particularly focused on the effects of social-context awareness on learning activity and social activity. The results showed that the SNAFA not only increase the participant rate of students on formative assessment and opportunities of knowledge sharing, but also promote learning achievement, compared to the Traditional Formative Assessment (TFA). (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction (p. 40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, providing feedback on formative assessments is difficult for teachers because they face a large number of students, lengthy pieces of work, or practical constraints such as time and workload (Buchanan, 2000; Wang, 2007). (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNA is used to be aware of the knowledge context and social context of the others (Zheng &amp;amp; Yano, 2007). Knowledge context, which reveals the peer candidate’s knowledge expertise and experience, is used to match ‘who knows what’ in the knowledge dimension. Social context, which reveals the nimbus (i.e. willingness to help other) of the peer candidates, their social network tie, and social network position (i.e. central/peripheral positions in a network), is used to harmonize ‘who is willing to collaborate. Being aware of both context information and the interactions among peers are deemed as scaffolds at stimulating students to reflect on learning, to imitate peers’ actions, and to motivate coherent discussions. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most SNA studies either focus on being aware of peer’s knowledge context (El-Bishouty et al., 2007; Yang, Chen, Kinshuk, &amp;amp; Chen, 2007) or on social context (Cadima et al., 2010; Chen, Hong, &amp;amp; Chang, 2008). (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work proposes online formative assessments with social network awareness to raise the opportunities of collaborative learning and participant rate within a community (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background (p. 41)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Social network awareness (SNA) (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social network awareness (SNA) has been extensively used as one of the strategies to promote the opportunities of peer interaction and collaboration, and to support the co-construction of knowledge and the sharing of information (Cadima et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2008; Chen, Chen &amp;amp; Kinshuk, 2009; Dawson, 2008; El-Bishouty et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2002; Yang, Chen, &amp;amp; KinshukChen, 2007). (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most SNA related works focus on the awareness of either peer’s knowledge context (El-Bishouty et al., 2007) or peer’s social context (Cadima et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2008). The social-context studies mainly focus on being aware of peer’s social status, including social network tie, social network position, and social interaction. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen et al. (2008) presented a method of mining social interactive networks, which used a prediction model based on peer’s past social interaction (i.e. request and response messages), to recommend appropriate peer helpers for a requester. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the knowledge-context studies mainly focus on being aware of peer’s proficiency level of a specific domain, including knowledge level and experience. For example, El-Bishouty et al. (2007) proposed a ubiquitous learning system, which used a prediction model mainly based on candidates’ proficiency level to recommend the qualified candidate for a help seeker. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang et al. (2007) has proposed a prediction model to recommend candidates based on a peer’s trust association and knowledge association. The knowledge association is the level of proficiency of a candidate pertaining to a specific knowledge domain. The trust association is the trustworthy level of a seeker to a candidate, which is determined by past social interaction (i.e. request and response messages) experience. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Investigation in social networks (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;social network tie has a positive correlation with the intention of knowledge sharing (Chen et al. 2009) and has an impact on learning outcomes on student sense of belonging to a community (Haythornthwaite, 2002). Members connected via weak social ties are less likely to utilize and share resources and information in contrast to members connected via strong ties (Dawson, 2008). (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, studies examining the impacts of social network position are relatively fewer and scant (Cho et al., 2007; Nurmela, Lehtinen, &amp;amp; Palonen, 1999). Cho et al. (2007) studies focused on the impact of social network position on learning performance in an online collaborative system. Nurmela et al. (1999) investigated only the relationship between social network position and message flows (received and sent messages) in an online collaborative system. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4. Contributions in this work (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, this work has three main contributions: (1) We propose the SNAFA, an online formative assessment system with social network awareness, which particular emphasizes on social-context awareness. (2) We compare the SNAFA and the Traditional Formative Assessment (TFA) and verify the superiority of SNAFA. (3) Many factors in social networks, such as message flow and system utilization, are further investigated via the SNAFA system to more perceive their effects on learning performance. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed SNAFA system (p. 43)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. The overall process (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall process consists of three phases: Initialization, Test, and Review phases. At the beginning, the Initialization phase is used to let each student preset his/her existing friendship network. Afterward, students enter the Test phase to take their online formative assessments. After the Test phase, students will know what questions they incorrectly answered. Then in the Review phase, students can know both social and knowledge contexts of peers and ask the desired candidates for help by referring the above information when encountering problems (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Initialization phase, each student in a community registers his/her personal information (e.g. account, name, and photo) in the SNAFA and then sets his/her existing friendship by selecting his/her close friends. After this phase, the SNAFA will record the relationship between students into the Social Network Database for generating social network position in the Review phase. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure of the Review phase consists of the following steps: Step 1: If all incorrectly answered questions (IAQs) are addressed, the Review process in this assessment terminates. Otherwise, the student enter step 2. Step 2: A student can ask for help by sending message to a helper. A student can select an appropriate helper though the provided information about social and knowledge contexts. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each incorrect question, the student can click the corresponding button called “looking for peer assistance” to generates the candidate list. These candidates are all answering the question correctly. Most importantly, the information about knowledge context and social context of each candidate, which is elaborated in next subsection, are also displayed. Then, the student can select desired helpers from the list and send help messages. When a request has responded, the student (i.e. help seeker) receives a notification e-mail sent from the system (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a student selects an incorrectly answered question, the candidate list, which contains student ID, name, SD, DC, CC, WD, and KD, appears, as Fig. 4(b) shows. The student can sort the list according to these fields: SD, DC, CC, WD, and KD. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method (p. 46)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research adopted a quasi-experimental design method. The study was administered to two 3rd-year classes of a university: the first class consisted of 53 students using SNAFA; the second class consisted of 52 students using TFA. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2. Measures (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2.1. Learning performance (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2.2. Participant social and learning activities (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results (p. 48)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appropriate peer helpers who have just learned something are often better able than teachers to explain it to their classmates in a way that is accessible (Nicol et al., 2006). Peer interaction also exposes students to alternative perspectives on problems and to alternative tactics and strategies. Alternative perspectives enable students to revise or reject their initial hypothesis, and construct new knowledge and meaning through negotiation (Nicol et al., 2006). (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third row of Table 5, the number of asking messages for five formative assessments is 28, 30, 43, 60, and 56, respectively. Apparently, the stably-increasing number (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2.2. Centrality versus posttest (p. 50)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 6 shows that the mean of the posttest of the Degree-HG (mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 76.27) is significantly higher than that of the Degree-LG (mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 63.23) (t &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 2.35, p &amp;lt; .05). It also shows that the mean of the posttest of the Closeness-HG (mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 73.96) is higher than that of the Closeness -LG (mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 65.54) (t &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 1.47, p &amp;gt; .05) although it does not reach significance. These results unveil that in the SNAFA, centrality indeed has certain influences on the posttest. (p. 50)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2.3. Centrality versus message flow Table 7 shows that the mean of the out-degree of the Degree-HG (mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 7.58) is significantly higher than that of the Degree-LG (mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 0.89) (t &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 3.24, p &amp;lt; .05). Also, the mean of the in-degree of the Degree-HG (mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 7.69) is significantly higher than that of the Degree-LG (mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 0.78) (t &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 2.77, p &amp;lt; .05). (p. 50)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
 These two results might be problematic, because two measures in each analysis are inter-dependent. For instance, centrality scores are linked to message flows (right?). (p. 50)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2.4. Centrality versus utilization (p. 51)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2.5. Correlation analysis (p. 51)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 11 shows the results and reveals that both centrality indices have a significant positive correlation with these variables: message flow (i.e. in-degree and out-degree) and utilization (i.e. retention time, and access time). Degree centrality has significant positive correlation with the posttest (the correlation &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 0.315, p &amp;lt; .01) but the correlation between closeness centrality and the posttest do not reach significance. (p. 51)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusion (p. 51)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, social-context information particularly includes nimbus, centrality, and social distance. Knowledge and social-context awareness regards as a scaffold, trying to raise the opportunities of peer interaction and collaborative feedback within a community. (p. 52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wen, M., Yang, D., &amp;amp; Rose, C. P. (2014). Linguistic Reflections of Student Engagement in Massive Open Online Courses. In ICWSM’14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Wen2014&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a novel approach to use linguistic features to measure student motivation and cognitive engagement (two important aspects for learning) in MOOC discussion forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Based on the learning sciences literature, we quantify a student’s level of engagement in a MOOC from two different angles: (1) displayed level of motivation to continue with the course and (2) the level of cognitive engagement with the learning material.&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Automated fine-grained content analyses offer the potential to detect and monitor evidence of student engagement and how it relates to other aspects of their behavior.&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As a methodological contribution, in this paper we investigate using computational linguistic models to measure learner motivation and cognitive engagement from the text of forum posts&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Conversation in the course forum is replete with terms that imply learner motivation.&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our methodology allows us to differentiate better among these students, and to identify danger signs that a struggling student is in need of support within a population whose interaction with the course offers the opportunity for effective support to be administered.&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In this paper, we attempt to automatically measure learner motivation based on such markers found in posts on the course discussion forums.&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We measure this difference in cognitive engagement with an estimated level of language abstraction. We find that users whose posts show a higher level of cognitive engagement are more likely to continue participating in the forum discussion.&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In this paper, we test the generality of our measures in three Coursera MOOCs focusing on distinct subjects. We demonstrate that our measures of engagement are consistently predicative of student dropout from the course forum across the three courses.&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is important to monitor learner motivation and how it varies along the course weeks. We propose to automatically measure learner motivation based on linguistic cues in the forum posts.&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are mainly three types of information available about the participation patterns of MOOC users: the survey information, the clickstream behavioral data, and the forum posts.&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Poellhuber et al. (2013) find that user goals specified in the pre-course survey were the strongest predictors of later learning behaviors.&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One exception is Ramesh et al. (2013), which uses sentiment and subjectivity of user posts to predict engagement/disengagement. However, neither sentiment nor subjectivity ended up being predictive of engagement in that work.&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An interesting paper to check. Contradicts with our findings&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not sure whether it&amp;rsquo;s true&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The level of a student’s motivation strongly influences the intensity of the student’s participation in the course.&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;4.1.1 Creating the Human-Coded Dataset: MTurk&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to make it practical to construct a reliable annotated corpus for developing our automated measure of student motivation.&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In order to construct a hand-coded dataset for training machine learning models later, we employed MTurk workers to rate each message with the level of learner motivation towards the course the corresponding post had.&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Using MTurk is a cool idea, although researchers may challenge the validity of the analysis&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;LIWC-cognitive words (Table 1, line 3): The cognitive mechanism dictionary in LIWC (Pennebaker &amp;amp; King, 1999) includes such terms as “thinking”, “realized”, “understand”, “insight” and “comprehend”.&amp;rdquo; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;First person pronouns&amp;rdquo; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Positive words (Table 1, line 5) from the sentiment lexicon (Liu et al. 2005) are also indicators of learner motivation.&amp;rdquo; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Another paper by Wen actually raises concerns around this statement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;4.1.3 Linguistic Markers of Learner Motivation&amp;rdquo; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;we work to find domain-independent motivation cues so that a machine learning model is able to capture motivation expressed in posts reliably across different MOOCs.&amp;rdquo; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Apply words&amp;rdquo; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Apply lexicon we use consists of words that are synonyms of “apply” or “use”: “apply”, “try”, “utilize”, “employ”, “practice”, “use”, “help”, “exploit” and “implement”.&amp;rdquo; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Need words (Table 1, line 2) show the participant’s need, plan and goals: “hope”, “want”, “need”, “will”, “would like”, “plan”, “aim” and “goal”.&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;4.2.1 Measuring Level of Language Abstraction&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Previous work measures level of language abstraction with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) word categories (Gill &amp;amp; Oberlander, 2002; Pennebaker &amp;amp; King, 1999; Yarkoni, 2010; Beukeboom, 2013). For a broader word coverage, we use the automatically generated abstractness dictionary from Turney et al. (2011) which is publicly available.&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The experiments in this section confirm that our theoryinspired features are indeed effective in practice, and generalize well to new domains. The bag-of-words model is hard to be applied to different course posts due to the different content of the courses.&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;4.2 Level of Cognitive Engagement&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We believe that level of language abstraction reflects the understanding that goes into using those abstract words when creating the post.&amp;rdquo; (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Littlejohn, A., Hood, N., Milligan, C., &amp;amp; Mustain, P. (&lt;sup&gt;2016&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Learning in MOOCs: Motivations and self-regulated learning in MOOCs. The Internet and Higher Education, 29, 40–48.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice research investigating SRL in MOOCs. Survey used for measuring SRL of learners; interviews were used to understand learners in greater details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No use of clicklog data to triangulate these findings could be a future direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive open online courses (MOOCs) require individual learners to be able to self-regulate their learning, determining when and how they engage. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the self-regulated learning (SRL) learners apply in a MOOC, in particular focusing on how learners&amp;rsquo; motivations for taking a MOOC influence their behaviour and employment of SRL strategies. Following a quantitative investigation of the learning behaviours of 788 MOOC participants, follow-up interviews were conducted with 32 learners. The study compares the narrative descriptions of behaviour between learners with self-reported high and low SRL scores. Substantial differences were detected between the self-described learning behaviours of these two groups in five of the sub-processes examined. Learners&amp;rsquo; motivations and goals were found to shape how they conceptualised the purpose of the MOOC, which in turn affected their perception of the learning process. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open nature of MOOCs, which allow anyone to enrol, leads to diversity in motivations and expectations among learners (Kizilcec et al., 2013). (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is growing concern that MOOCs have not had as profound or as immediate an impact on education as initially anticipated (Gillani &amp;amp; Eynon, 2014). Research has not adequately addressed the unique nature of learning and learners in MOOCs or examined the new methods of knowledge production and learning that MOOCs can support (Gillani &amp;amp; Eynon, 2014; Milligan, Littlejohn, &amp;amp; Margaryan, 2013). A number of studies have focused on what can easily be measured at scale, such as progression, retention and completion rates (Breslow et al., 2013; Guo &amp;amp; Reinecke, 2014; Kizilcec, Piech, &amp;amp; Schneider, 2013; Liyanagunawardena, Adams, &amp;amp; Williams, 2013). The employment of these measures as proxies of learning does not adequately take into account the unique structure of MOOCs, the new forms of learning opportunities they promote or the diversity of learners participating in MOOCs. More research is required, which focuses on the unique nature of learning and learners in MOOCs and examines the new methods of knowledge production and learning that they can support. (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that learners who are better able to self-regulate their learning, in either formal or informal settings, employ more effective learning approaches in online settings (for a review of this research see Bernacki, Aguilar, &amp;amp; Byrnes, 2011). Initial research into the role that self-regulated learning (SRL) plays in supporting learning in MOOCs has identified a range of cognitive, affective and behavioural factors that impact learning in a MOOC (Hood, Littlejohn, &amp;amp; Milligan, 2015). (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study explores in detail how learners self-regulate their learning in the ‘Introduction to Data Science’ MOOC offered by the University of Washington through Coursera MOOC platform. The MOOC attracted 50,000 participants from 197 countries. The study is framed by the research question ‘What self-regulated learning strategies do learners apply in a MOOC?’ and explores how self-regulated learning (SRL) (p. 40)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;strategies vary between learners who score low and high on a measure of SRL. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Zimmerman, 2000a p. 14). Zimmerman identified three phases of self-regulated learning – forethought, performance and selfreflection – and a number of sub-processes associated with each phase. Self-regulation is not fixed. The ability to self-regulate one&amp;rsquo;s learning is mediated by both personal–psychological factors (cognitive and affective) and contextual–environmental factors (Pintrich, 2000). Self-regulation has been positively associated with academic outcomes in formal, offline learning contexts (Pintrich &amp;amp; de Groot, 1990; Zimmerman &amp;amp; Schunk, 2001) and an increasing number of studies have investigated the role that SRL plays in online learning environments (for a comprehensive overview, see Bernacki et al., 2011). (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background (p. 41)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another study, focused on self-regulated learning in a MOOC, identified four SRL sub-processes where differences were noted between people exhibiting high and low self-regulation — goal setting, self-efficacy, learning and task strategies, and help-seeking strategies (Milligan &amp;amp; Littlejohn, in press). Further research on self-regulated learning in a MOOC identified significant differences in self-regulated learning behaviour between learners from different contexts and professional roles (Hood et al., 2015). (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus in these studies on progression, retention and MOOC completion rates as indicators of learning have enabled an understanding of the whole MOOC cohort but provide little insight into the behaviour and learning of the individual. Furthermore, the use of completion rates as a proxy for learning success is problematic in the MOOC context. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methodology (p. 41)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative data was collected through a survey posted on the course message board. The survey was a slightly modified version of a published, validated instrument designed to measure SRL and SRL sub-processes of adult learners in informal learning contexts (Fontana, Milligan, Littlejohn, &amp;amp; Margaryan, 2015). The survey instrument is available at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.866774&#34;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.866774&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigations of learning in MOOCs must also take into account the non-formal nature of MOOCs, which allows learners to engage in nonlinear learning trajectories that do not follow a pre-established, sequential progression (Guo &amp;amp; Reinecke, 2014). (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants who completed the survey and identified as data professionals (n = 362) were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. A semi-structured interview instrument was designed to probe the full range of SRL sub-processes identified by Zimmerman (2000a) with questions developed iteratively over a number of studies (Fontana et al., 2015; Milligan &amp;amp; Littlejohn, in press). The questions were adapted to fit the context of this study and to ensure that they were directly relevant to participants&amp;rsquo; experience of the MOOC. Relevant questions are included in the results section below, with the whole interview script available at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1300050&#34;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1300050&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

 check out Guo 2014 as well (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of learner behaviour in four MOOCs determined that certificate earners viewed on average only 78% of learning sequences, completely skipping 22%, and navigation backjumps from assessments to lectures were more common than lecture-to-lecture backjumps (Guo &amp;amp; Reinecke, 2014). (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data were analysed in three successive rounds, with the eight SRL sub-processes operating as the initial coding framework. First, each of the 32 transcripts was coded independently by two researchers. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. Construct definitions (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, participants were each assigned a rank (1 to 32) corresponding to their overall SRL score, which was calculated by adding the responses for each of the 39 items, with a minimum possible score of 39 and a maximum score of 195. In order to develop a more robust understanding of self-regulated learning behaviour, alongside their overall rank position, participants were also ranked for each of the eight SRL subprocesses reported in Table 1. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation and goal setting refers to learners&amp;rsquo; motivations and reasons for taking the course as well as the aims for learning and performance outcomes they established at the start of the MOOC. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third round of analysis, transcripts were analysed in relation to participants&amp;rsquo; SRL scores, in order to see whether there were any discernible differences in the interviews of participants with higher and lower SRL scores. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-efficacy refers to the extent to which an individual feels confident in their ability to engage with and complete the learning activities offered on the MOOC and their ability to persevere when learning becomes challenging. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-satisfaction and evaluation combine two of Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s SRL sub-processes, from the self-reflection phase. Evaluation refers to an individual&amp;rsquo;s awareness of their learning behaviour and the manner in which they compare their self-observed performance against some standard, such as their prior performance, another person&amp;rsquo;s performance or an absolute standard of performance (Zimmerman, 2002). Self-satisfaction encompasses how satisfied learners are with their performance and progression towards their objectives. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task strategies encompass the ability of the learner to plan their learning and to identify and employ learning approaches that will enable them to learn. It also incorporates the ability of learners to adjust their strategies and plans throughout their learning journey. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Findings and discussion (p. 43)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task interest value refers to learners&amp;rsquo; perceptions of how valuable the MOOC is to them. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents analysis of data from interviews with participants in the Introduction to Data Science MOOC. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1. Motivation and goal setting (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, twelve participants with higher SRL scores discussed their motivation in relation to their professional development and how the MOOC would contribute to their professional roles and work context. Their goals were focused primarily around improving their skillset and gaining general content knowledge (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learners who believed that they had a good basic understanding of data science were more confident in their ability to learn and engage in the MOOC. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specificity of learning objectives and goals highlighted in this quote was a common feature among high self-regulators. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second factor affecting self-efficacy was whether participants had previously participated in a MOOC (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, low self-regulators tended to discuss their learning in more abstract terms. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to connect their learning experiences in a MOOC either to their existing knowledge or to previous learning experiences appears to increase learners&amp;rsquo; self-efficacy. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difference in motivation and goal-orientation between high and low self-regulators is supported by the literature. Zimmerman (2000a) suggests that high self-regulators are more likely to adopt a ‘mastery goal orientation’, structuring their learning around the development of content knowledge and expertise. Pintrich and de Groot (1990) further suggest that intrinsic motivation is linked to self-regulation. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five participants who had high overall SRL scores scored in the bottom half of learners for self-efficacy. These participants were not as confident in their existing content knowledge; however, they considered themselves to be effective learners and had confidence in their ability to engage with the course material. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference in motivation and goals between the two groups of learners in this study aligns with Pintrich and de Groot&amp;rsquo;s (1990) distinction between learning versus performance goals. While many learners with low SRL scores did mention they were motivated by a love of learning, their goals were focused around traditional measures of performance (i.e. passing assignments, and course completion) whereas high self-regulators were less concerned about outward measures of performance than developing knowledge and expertise that was relevant to their professional needs. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2. Self-efficacy (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.3. Task interest value (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of participants, both high and low self-regulators, exhibited high self-efficacy scores. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High SRL participants placed greater value on acquiring skills and content knowledge than those with low SRL scores. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;progression through the MOOC, instead determining their own trajectory based on their individual needs. They also were more likely to adapt their approach to learning over time in order to best suit their needs. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learners with high SRL scores were more likely to evaluate their learning in relation their professional roles, where the value of the learning process is inseparable from its application in their workplace context. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman (2000a) suggests that higher levels of self-regulation are related both to a wide range of strategies and the ability to rethink the strategies employed throughout the learning process. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, learners with low SRL scores tended to be more structured and linear in their approach to learning. They were more likely to follow the course in a structured way, scheduling specific times each week to engage with the MOOC and pre-determining the activities and tasks they wanted to complete. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High SRL participants not only evaluated their learning in relation to their current professional context and needs but also were more likely to connect their learning to their future needs (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of the low SRL learners had the goal of completing all of the assessments and earning the certificate of completion, they not only engaged with more of the material but were also more likely to dedicate greater amounts of time to the MOOC. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, while five low SRL participants mentioned the importance of real-world applicability, task interest value was more readily associated with performative outcomes by these learners. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value was measured extrinsically, with the certificate functioning as a signal of their learning. Seven low SRL learners, compared with only one high SRL learner, discussed the importance of the certificate for demonstrating to their employers what they had learned. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This learner employed a structured approach to their learning, establishing the strategies that they will utilise prior to engaging. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These learners approached the MOOC as a more formal learning opportunity, similar to a traditional HE course. In contrast, learners (generally those with higher self-regulated learning scores) who conceptualised the MOOC as a non-formal learning opportunity that supported their professional learning and development were less structured in how they approached the MOOC. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.4. Task strategies (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wide range of task strategies were identified with little observable pattern between participants overall SRL score and the specific task strategies they employed. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting&lt;br /&gt;
 this section about task strategies is the most interesting so far. it challenges some of the most used proxies of MOOC success (e.g., earning a certificate) by distinguishing low vs. high SRL learners within groups (e.g., learners earning certificates) that are otherwise treated as the same. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.5. Self-satisfaction and evaluation (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both high SRL and low SRL participants used the exercises and assignments in the MOOC as a benchmark to evaluate their performance. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the specific task strategies being employed were evenly distributed among participants, differences were detected in the overall learning approaches between learners with high and low self-regulated learning scores. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High SRL participants used the activities as an opportunity to monitor their progression. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly self-regulated learners tended to be more flexible in their approach to learning. They were less likely to follow a linear (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This connection between the forethought phase (motivation and goal setting) and the self-reflection phase (evaluation and self-satisfaction) aligns with Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s (2008) suggestion that learners who set specific goals were more likely to adopt mastery criteria to self-evaluate rather than normative criteria. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, however, these types of learners are not attempting to measure their performance against others but rather are using other people to question how they can improve their own approach. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusions (p. 46)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the low SRL participants were more likely to conceptualise the assignments as being summative, functioning as the end point of their learning. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study have identified differences in behaviour associated with five SRL sub-processes – motivation and goals setting, self-efficacy, task interest value, task strategies, and self-satisfaction and evaluation – between MOOC participants classified as having high overall SRL scores and those with low overall SRL scores. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five low SRL participants acknowledged that it was often difficult to perceive and measure their own learning ‘Yeah that&amp;rsquo;s a difficult question because I don&amp;rsquo;t perceive my own learning’ (Number 396, ranked 17 for SRL, 18 for self-satisfaction and evaluation). (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals with high SRL scores engaged with the MOOC primarily as a professional learning opportunity. Their motivation and goals for participation centred around the development of knowledge and expertise that was tied specifically to their workplace context rather than more extrinsic motivations such as passing the assignments and receiving the certificate of completion. This led to their conceptualisation of the MOOC as a non-formal learning opportunity, enabling each learner to independently determine activities and material they would engage with based on their individual needs, rather than the more formal course requirements. By centring their engagement around their specific needs, they adopted more flexible task strategies, which enabled them to readily adapt their approach as and when they needed to. The close connection between their participation in the MOOC and their workplace needs (both present and future) led these learners to score highly for task interest value, as they could apply their learning directly to their professional roles and workplace tasks. This focus on expertise development for their professional roles rather than formal achievement translated into higher overall satisfaction. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-satisfaction was strongly connected to learners&amp;rsquo; initial expectations and goals for the MOOC. Those participants (six low SRL and two high SRL) who wanted to complete all the assignments and receive a certificate of completion and approached the MOOC as a formal learning opportunity tended to be less satisfied with their learning. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the high SRL participants, there was a consistent pattern of being highly satisfied with their participation and learning. These learners were more motivated by a desire to enhance their expertise than to achieve certification. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they were not conceptualising the MOOC as a traditional HE course, with a linear progression towards pre-established performative goals (assessments and completion), these learners had to determine independently with what content and how often they would engage. These participants evaluated their learning in relation to how well it related to their professional roles and continually adjusted their engagement in order to ensure that they were gaining maximum learning outcomes (as determined by themselves, rather than in relation to formal assessments or external markers). (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The binary division between completers and non-completers is not an adequate measure of quality or of learning in MOOCs. It fails to take into account the varied goals of learners or the ability of individual learners to determine personal markers of success. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, those learners with low overall SRL scores tended to be more concerned with gaining a certificate of completion and consequently were more focused on completing all of the activities and assessments. While also engaging in the course to support their professional development, these learners were more likely to be driven by extrinsic motivation factors, and used external markers as evidence of their learning. These learners were less likely to connect their learning to specific workplace tasks or to discuss how they were actively applying the knowledge and expertise they were developing in their work context. They tended to conceptualise the MOOC as a formal learning activity, adopting a more uniform and linear approach to their engagement. Their learning was centred primarily on the MOOC itself, rather than being distributed between the MOOC and the offline setting of their workplace. This led to lower levels of task interest value, as learners were less consciously connecting their learning to their wider settings. This influenced the ways in which these learners assessed their learning, with most learners using extrinsic measures, such as achievement in the assessments or completion of the course, to evaluate their learning. It is possible that the higher levels of extrinsic motivation and the conceptualisation of the MOOC as a formal learning activity among these low SRL learners meant that they had less need to self-regulate their learning compared with participants who adopted a less linear and more flexible approach to their learning. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, they question traditional pathways, purposes and outcomes in education. Research must engage deeply with these differences in order to enhance the learning opportunities that MOOCs, and future forms of open learning, provide for all learners. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a connection between a learner&amp;rsquo;s motivations and goals and their conceptualisation of learning in MOOCs is apparent in this study, it is not possible to determine which is the driving factor. Does a learner&amp;rsquo;s motivation and goals for a MOOC influence the learning approach they adopt and consequently their overall self-regulated learning? Or, does a learner&amp;rsquo;s self-regulated learning influence the approach that they adopt and shape their motivations and goals for the MOOC? (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: An early review of the MOOC literature. Forty-five peer reviewed papers are identified, using several different search strategies. Several glitches/hurdles were noted, such as other research using the same acronym. Quantitative analysis deals with pub year, counts in journals, leading authors, etc. Qualitative content analysis arrives at eight different areas of interest, introductory, concept, case studies, educational theory, technology, participant focussed, provider focussed, and other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;: A useful study of early stage development of MOOC research. As expected, most results reflect cMOOCs (esp case studies of cMOOCs). Worth considering together with later studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: NA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a systematic review of the published MOOC literature (2008-2012): Forty-five peer reviewed papers are identified through journals, database searches, searching the Web, and chaining from known sources to form the base for this review. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review categorises the literature into eight different areas of interest, introductory, concept, case studies, e ducational theory, technology, participant focussed, provider focussed, and other, while also providing quantitative analysis of publications according to publication type, year of publication, and contributors. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Collection (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant papers were identified through a series of search efforts, using an approach based on the methods used in other systematic reviews including two studies of literature related to the microblogging system Twitter (Gao, Luo, &amp;amp; Zhang, 2012; Williams, Terras, &amp;amp; Warwick, 2013). Papers were classed as relevant if their primary focus was to explore the concept of a MOOC or the implications for higher education, report on experiments with MOOCs, or compare MOOCs with other educational approaches. There was insufficient statistical data across the papers found to undertake a meta-analysis (Fink 2010). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the search terms and boundaries to be used were established. Initially two search terms (and their plurals) were selected: • MOOC • Massively Open Online Course However it was identified that some authors used “Massive” instead of “Massively” (for example Kop, Fournier, &amp;amp; Mak 2011) and so the third term (and its plural) was added: • Massive Open Online Course (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search period was limited to the period from the year in which the first MOOC was run (2008) to the year this study started (2012). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, following the approach of Gao, et al. ( 2012) , a number of academic journals in the disciplines of educational technology and distance education were selected for a preliminary search (Table 1). These journals were The British Journal of Educational Technology, Distance Education, American Journal of Distance Education, and Journal of Online Learning and Teaching. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the same search terms were then used to search various academic databases: ISI Web of Knowledge, ProQuest (ERIC, British Education Index and Australian Education Index), JSTOR (education titles), IEEEXplorer, and Scopus (Table 2). A number of the articles returned were unrelated to this study, for example papers returned included some on “Multiple Optical Orthogonal Code Sequences” and some on “Management of Organizational Change”2, both of which were abbreviated to MOOC. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;important to note (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, the same search was conducted using the Google Scholar search engine with 94 results (November 21, 2012). From these results only 33 were found to be relevant. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to improve the coverage of relevant publications to be included in this review, the chaining technique of Gao, et al. (2012) was used: consulting the reference lists of papers that were already in the corpus to locate other relevant work. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collection process resulted in the identification of 45 distinct articles – 17 from journals, 13 conference publications (including one poster conference presentation), 10 academic magazine articles, 3 reports, and 2 workshop presentations. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Classification/Analysis (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantitative analysis was used to classify the papers according to the publication year and the type of publication in which the article appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified using open coded content analysis, a technique used by the two studies of literature relating to Twitter (Gao, et al., 2012; Williams, Terras, &amp;amp; Warwick 2013). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first MOOC related paper was published in 2008, with again just one paper identified in 2009, seven papers in 2010, 10 in 2011, and 26 in 2012. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of identified articles published to date are in journals (17 papers), with a smaller number of articles appearing in conference proceedings and magazines (13 and 10 respectively). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is noticeable that while many of the publications identified only had one article on MOOCs, exceptionally among the journals the International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning published six articles on MOOCs, while the European Journal of Open Distance and E-Learning pub lished three. Communications of the ACM published the highest number of magazine articles (three) while eLearn Magazine and Learning Solutions magazine published two articles each. The International Conference on Networked Learning published three articles on MOOCs, two in 2010 and another in 2011. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of authors with more than one article being reviewed here are presented in Table 3. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publication Topics/Themes (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The articles embraced a wide-range of themes relating to MOOCs; an initial list included3: • agency • connectivism • actor network theory • dangers • learner experience • pedagogies • technology • trends (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes were re-stratified into the following categories. 1. Introductory: explaining aspects of MOOCs. 2. Concept: encompassing discussion papers on topics such as the threats and opportunities of MOOCs for Higher Education and its existing institutions. 3. Case studies: examining one or more MOOCs (including papers studying the same course running in different years and papers studying different courses). 4. Educational theory: considering the pedagogic approaches used. 5. Technology: presenting details or consideration of the software and hardware used. 6. Participant focussed: considering aspects related to the learners participating in MOOCs. 7. Provider focussed: considering aspects related to the provider of the MOOC, including the course creators and leaders. 8. Other: this category was introduced to cover the two articles that did not come under any other category. These were Esposito (2012), which discussed ethical (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;issues in using data generated through a MOOC, and Frank (2012), which presented the author’s views on alternative ways to run MOOCs. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case Studies (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the articles classified, 21 had a case study element, and in total 13 different MOOCs were studied. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers’ role. Seven of the case study articles defined the researcher’s role in relation to the study. In two of these instances the researcher was described as a learner in the MOOC, in another two as a participant, and in the remaining three as an observer. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants. The majority of the participants in the case study research were people who had participated in the MOOC under consideration. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other materials such as blog posts and unpublished reports are not included in this review. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles published in languages other than English were not considered for this review. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite many research studies using publicly available data from a MOOC for research purposes, only a few papers have considered the ethical aspects of such use. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Lockyer2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lockyer, L., Heathcote, E., &amp;amp; Dawson, S. (2013). Informing Pedagogical Action: Aligning Learning Analytics With Learning Design. American Behavioral Scientist, 57(10), 1439–1459. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1177&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;0002764213479367&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning design is a new area for me. But one critical point made in this article is that interpretation of learning analytics should be made in the context of pedagogical designs. This is a point that should not be neglected so often in learning analytics research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article presents learning design as a form of documentation of pedagogical intent that can provide the context for making sense of diverse sets of analytic data. We investigate one example of learning design to explore how broad categories of analytics—which we call checkpoint and process analytics—can inform the interpretation of outcomes from a learning design and facilitate pedagogical action. (p. 1439)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article examines two relatively new concepts within education, learning analytics, that is, the collection, analysis, and reporting of data associated with student learning behavior, and learning design, that is, the documented design and sequencing of teaching practice, and how together these may serve to improve understanding and evaluation of teaching intent and learner activity. (p. 1439)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning designs, which document pedagogical intent and plans, potentially provide the context to make sense of learning analytics data. Essentially, learning design establishes the objectives and pedagogical plans, which can then be evaluated against the outcomes captured through learning analytics. (p. 1440)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high adoption of education technologies, such as learning management systems (LMS), has resulted in a vast set of alternate and accessible learning data (Greller &amp;amp; (p. 1440)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drachsler, in press; Pardo &amp;amp; Kloos, 2012). Student interactions with the course activities via the LMS are captured and stored. The resulting digital footprints can be collected and analyzed to establish indicators of teaching quality and provide more proactive assessment of student learning and engagement. (p. 1441)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergent field is multidisciplinary and draws on methodologies related to educational data mining, social network analysis, artificial intelligence, psychology, and educational theory and practice. (p. 1441)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we use the term learning design, but work in the same vein has been carried out under such names as pedagogical patterns, learning patterns, and pattern language. Learning design describes the sequence of learning tasks, resources, and supports that a teacher constructs for students over part of, or the (p. 1441)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;entire, academic semester. A learning design captures the pedagogical intent of a unit of study. Learning designs provide a board picture of a series of planned pedagogical actions rather than detailed accounts of a particular instructional event (as might be described in a traditional lesson plan). As such, learning designs provide a model for intentions in a particular learning context that can be used as a framework for design of analytics to support faculty in their learning and teaching decisions. (p. 1442)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the broad field of learning design was underpinned by two main aims: to promote teaching quality and to facilitate the integration of technology into teaching and learning. (p. 1442)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research and development work in this area have included the creation of online repositories of learning designs that teachers could read, interpret, and adapt to their own practice (e.g., Agostinho, Harper, Oliver, Hedberg, &amp;amp; Wills, 2008; Conole &amp;amp; Culver, 2010) and the development of technical languages and tools designed to make learning designs machine readable and adaptable (Koper, 2006; Masterman, 2009). (p. 1442)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learning designs come in many forms and level of detail. Some draw on an architectural model to describe textually solutions to common educational problems (McAndrew &amp;amp; Goodyear, 2007). Some use common representations such as process diagrams, flowcharts, and tables (Falconer, Beetham, Oliver, Lockyer, &amp;amp; Littlejohn, 2007), and others combine text descriptions with graphical representations (Agostinho et al., 2008). (p. 1442)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the format in which learning designs are documented, essential elements include identifying the key actors involved (teachers and students), what they are expected to do (teaching and learning tasks), what educational resources (p. 1442)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are used to support the activities, and the sequence in which the activities unfold. These essential elements may be presented with great detail and provide a highly contextualized description of a particular unit, covering specific topics. Or they may be presented more generically, free of the detail of any particular implementation of the design. Learning designs also range in granularity from presenting a teaching and learning process that might occur for an entire semester-long course to that which might occur in only one class. (p. 1443)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most easily understood and adapted common elements within all learning designs include the following: • A set of resources for the student to access, which could be considered to be prerequisites to the learning itself (these may be files, diagrams, questions, web links, prereadings, etc.) • Tasks the learners are expected to carry out with the resources (prepare and present findings, negotiate understanding, etc.) • Support mechanisms to assist in the provision of resources and the completion of the tasks; these supports indicate how the teacher, other experts, and peers might contribute to the learning process (e.g., such as moderation of a discussion or feedback on an assessment piece; Bennett et al., 2004) (p. 1443)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although learning designs can provide a description of pedagogical intention, they do not identify how students are engaged in that design during or postimplementation. This is where learning analytics can provide information for a more holistic perspective of the impact of learning activities. (p. 1443)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at present, the predominance of learning analytics research centers on the types of data available in institutional LMS. (p. 1444)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1. Examples of Learning Analytics Tools and Visualizations. (p. 1445)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpretation of the analysis thus requires alignment with the original teaching context if it is to be useful as feedback on whether the learning design has achieved its intent. Interpretation requires an understanding of the relationship among technology functionality, observed interactions behaviors, and educational theory (Heathcote, 2006). (p. 1446)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Analytics to Evaluate Learning Design (p. 1447)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although learning designs provide theoretical, practice-based, and/or evidence-based examples of sound educational design, learning analytics may allow us to test those assumptions with actual student interaction data in lieu of self-report measures such as post hoc surveys. In particular, learning analytics provides us with the necessary data, methodologies, and tools to support the quality and accountability that have been called for in higher education. (p. 1448)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligning Learning Analytics With Learning Design (p. 1448)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first relates to what we term checkpoint analytics, that is, the snapshot data that indicate a student has met the prerequisites for learning by accessing the relevant resources of the learning design. (p. 1448)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second type of learning analytics we term process analytics. These data and analyses provide direct insight into learner information processing and knowledge application (Elias, 2011) within the tasks that the student completes as part of a learning design. (p. 1448)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The articulation of the nature of support available within learning designs helps to interpret process learning analytics. (p. 1449)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Analytics Can Support Implementation of a Learning Design (p. 1451)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage 1: Case Analysis Task—Checkpoint Analytics. Learning analytics can generate reports of student log-in behaviors and access to individual cases; these provide the teacher with indicators of when students have commenced the learning sequence. (p. 1451)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage 2: Case Analysis Discussion Task—Process Analytics. Once students analyze their case individually, they then share their ideas with their project group members. They identify issues that arose in these cases and consider how they may be applicable to the project they are about to undertake. A network diagram (p. 1451)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage 3:Whole-Class Discussion Task—Process Analytics. After the project groups discuss their case analyses, the learning design calls for the teacher to facilitate a whole-class discussion. If successful, the social network analysis of discussion forum posts should illustrate the teacher as central in the network. (p. 1452)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage 4: Project Proposal Task—Process Analytics. At this stage, students begin their project task. In the first part of the project task, students work in a small group to collaborate on their project proposal. If the task is completed within a discussion forum, a social network diagram could be used to indicate established density and connections of participation as well as outliers or disconnected students disengaged from the task. (p. 1452)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage 6:ReflectionTask—Checkpoint or Process. The final reflection task can be assessed using both checkpoint and process analytics. The checkpoint is to verify whether the self-reflection template has been accessed or uploaded with student changes. In addition, further content analysis can be undertaken to map student reflections and changes over an extended period. Self-reflection requires strong metacognitive capacities that have been demonstrated to be essential for developing the skills necessary for lifelong learning (Butler &amp;amp; Winne, 1995). (p. 1454)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Analytics Support Implementation and Redesign (p. 1454)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion (p. 1455)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article argued that the evaluative potential of learning analytics would be significantly enhanced by reference to the learning design that documents pedagogical intent. (p. 1455)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: One interesting approach used in this paper is key word network based on co-occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;: However, the extraction of dominant keywords did not offer significant insights in the discourse. The discussion mentioned that influential pieces in MOOCs exist in non-academic spaces like blogs, highlighting a tension among different spaces for scholarly communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: NA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study analyzes the impact of the MOOC movement in the form of scientific article during the birth and explosion period (2010-2013) in two of the most relevant databases: Journal Citation Reports (WoS) and Scopus (Scimago). We present, through a descriptive and quantitative methodology, the most significant bibliometric data according to citation index and database impact. Furthermore, with the use of a methodology based on social network analysis (SNA), an analysis of the article’s keyword co-occurrence is presented through graphs to determine the fields of study and research. The results show that both the number of articles published and the citations received in both databases present a medium-low signi- ficant impact, and the conceptual network of relationships in the abstracts and keywords does not reflect the current analysis developed in general educational media. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. Objectives The research aims were twofold: • To quantify from a bibliometric approach the MOOC scientific production in the form of articles in (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JCR and Scopus databases during the period 2010- 2013, according to the following variables: total num- ber of published papers; number of received citations; major citable journals; average citations per year; name, country, and institutional affiliation of the most cited authors; and articles’ methodological approach. • Analyze the key words used in articles to esta- blish the thematic and conceptual implications to bet- ter understand the MOOC movement. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. Research design and analysis (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the application to the study of semantic keywords with the technique of social network analysis (Knoke &amp;amp; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of databases from a comparative perspective is a research method used in measu- ring the impact of a term or trend and is usually referenced to three international databases: JCR, Scopus, and Google Scholar (Jacso, 2005; Levine-Clark &amp;amp; Gil, 2009), (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data analysis (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;authors, countries, institutions, and subject areas (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ubse - quently, we turned to the analysis of keywords fre- quency (Bhattacharya &amp;amp; al., 2003; Ding, Chowd hury &amp;amp; Foo, 2001) with special attention to the analysis of co-occurrence within the specific research domain of MOOCs. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the search equation «mooc» or «MOOC» or «massive open online course» was used in both JCR and Scopus databases. With the initial informa- tion from both databases, a total of 63 publications in JCR and 180 in Scopus were retrieved, and they were finally reduced to 48 and 111, respectively, by removing books, books chapters, repeated records, irrelevant publications, conference proceedings, and documents that did not fit the purpose of the study or were out of the 2010-2013 interval. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 6 presents the impact of the most cited aut- hors in the two databases, (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 7 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/4Tm3vs&#34;&gt;http://goo.gl/4Tm3vs&lt;/a&gt;) shows the most active countries during this early period of the move- ment. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we conducted an analysis of the relations established between keywords through a graph representation. We then chose the words «Abstract» and «Keywords» as the basis for obtaining the word network once the article has been uploaded to the archive, and for the development of binary count, we considered a minimum of two items: (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Of a total of 530 terms extracted from Web of Science, the program determined that only 67 terms meet this criterion. • Of a total of 1,715 terms extracted from Scopus, the program determined that only 323 terms meet this criterion. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The networks presented in Figures 2 and 3 are the graphical representation of the matrix of relations among keywords in JCR and Scopus, respectively. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JCR, Figure 2 shows the central position of concepts in the network (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a higher node degree focus on the following items: «educational resource», «open- ness», «assessment» and «impact». (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Scopus network (Figure 3), the results of the betweenness degree are significant 27,248 (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;recurrent in the published articles: «education», «learning», «experience», «environment» and «design». The results of degree of closeness indicate that, in these five major nodes, those aspects that serve to interrelate the domi- nant categories in the publication of articles indexed in Scopus. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis by networks of abstract and keywords shows that MOOC’s relations are being linked thema- tically with the educational experience of learning, environment, design, and evaluation. These relations are not in direct line with the current main criticism that focuses on the pedagogical principles of connecti- vism, monetization, accreditation, and technological architecture of platforms and resources embedded in them (Hill, 2012; Daniel 2012, Vázquez-Cano, López-Meneses &amp;amp; Sarasola, 2013). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some of the biggest names in MOOC research, such as George Siemens, Stephen Downes, and Sir John Daniel, have not published in both data- bases and develop their reflections in lower impact journals and in their own Web pages, blogs, specific newspapers, social networks, and so on.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: Very interesting study investigating factors impacting (reflected in) coauthorship relations in a new field. SIENA was used for the modeling of network dynamics. Key finding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together with net findings about cognitive dissimilarity, this study suggests that innovation in networked research is most likely when teams draw on individuals with diverse knowledge resources, but who also have prior collaborations with each other or with common others. The key to sustaining innovation in such teams is to reduce the possibility that close collaboration results in a reduction of the diversity in their knowledge expertise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: Useful for ongoing work on coauthorship in ET and MOOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to model interdependencies between the citation and coauthorship networks. Also wondering that publications have substantial latency, happening way after the actual collaboration. Wondering whether it would be helpful to see more real-time data (Slack?). It depends on how one conceptualizes collaboration. I guess publication is the most direct way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract This study examines the influence of different types of diversity, both observable and unobservable, on the creation of innovative ideas. Our framework draws on theory and research on information processing, social categorization, coordination, and homophily to posit the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity on innovation. Our longitudinal model is based on a unique data set of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a 4-year period. We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country, and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks. We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study focuses on the dilemma of diversity for fostering innovation in networked research. On the one hand, generating innovative ideas requires the ability for recombinant searches (Fleming &amp;amp; Sorenson, 2001) across diverse areas of the knowledge possessed within the team (West, 2002). On the other hand, it requires team members who are comfortable work- ing with each other (e.g., Guimera, Uzzi, Spiro, &amp;amp; Amaral, 2005; Taylor &amp;amp; Greve, 2006). We seek to address this dilemma by parsing the effects of different dimensions of diversity and network ties on innovation in networked research. More specifically, we examine the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity (or its opposite, homophily), as well as prior network ties on the emergence of collaborative networks of innovation over time. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretical Background and Hypotheses (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on teams has investigated several dimensions of diversity that affect creativ- ity and innovation (Cady &amp;amp; Valentine, 1999; Joshi &amp;amp; Roh, 2009). These dimensions have been broadly considered in two categories: whether they are relatively unobserv- able (such as cognitive or expertise diversity) or observable (such as gender and coun- try diversity). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive diversity. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams and O’Reilly (1998) noted that diversity of knowledge is useful for idea generation and performance in teams. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 1: Individuals that possess disparate knowledge are more likely to pro- duce innovative ideas through collaboration. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender homophily. Self-categorization theory suggests that individuals characterize themselves using categories such as age, gender, and race (e.g., Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp;amp; Wetherell, 1987). Individuals then select similar others in order to reduce the potential conflict in their relations (Byrne, 1971), or to reduce the psychological discomfort that may arise from cognitive or emotional differences (Heider, 1958). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender homophily represents one dimension of homophily (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 2: Individuals of the same gender are more likely to produce innova- tive ideas through collaboration. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Country homophily. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 3: Individuals located within the same country are more likely to pro- duce innovative ideas through collaboration. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methodology (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data and Sample (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested these hypotheses using archival and bibliographic data about teams that col- laborated to publish scientific articles in the recently emerging field of Oncofertility. The term oncofertility, coined in 2007, refers to research on fertility preservation for cancer patients. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified all scientific articles that were published in the field of Oncofertility using the keywords oncofertility, or cancer and ovarian tissue cryopreservation, or cancer and fertility preservation. We used the Web of Science (Wo S) database to con- struct researchers’ coauthorship relations (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data set for this study utilized all publications between 2007 and 2010, and comprised 469 publica- tions from 1,354 researchers. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author name disambiguation is a recognized issue when constructing bibliometric measures (Torvik, Weeber, Swanson, &amp;amp; Smalheiser, 2005). To address this limitation, we took a conservative approach in identifying an author’s non-Oncofertility publications, con- sidering only those publications with identical author names, e-mail addresses, and Digital Author Identification system numbers, a unique internal ID used by Wo S data- base to disambiguate authors. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demographic information and country affiliation were manually coded (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our dependent variable is the collaboration network (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coauthorship of a journal publication is an important measure of researchers’ collaborative relation- ship (Guimera et al., 2005). Thus, based on publication information, we defined a coauthorship relation between two researchers if they published a scientific article together in the field of Oncofertility. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;four undirected 1,354 by 1,354 coauthorship relation matrices, one for each year of observation (2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis was confined to a binary, rather than a weighted coauthorship network, because stochastic actor-oriented models, used for our analysis, are currently only developed for binary dependent network relations (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control variables. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we control for the potentially confounding effects associated with network structures and individual researchers’ attributes. In terms of the former, we control for the endogenous and exogenous effects of net- work structures on coauthorship relations. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endogenous network effects control for (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the tendency of creating new coauthorship ties based exclusively on prior ties of the same kind, such as previous coauthorship in the area of Oncofertility. Exogenous network effects control for the tendency to explain the creation of new ties based on the existence of prior ties of a different kind, such as prior coauthorship on non- Oncofertility publications. Additionally, we also controlled for country and gender as these two attributes may affect a researcher’s proclivity to coauthor Oncofertility publications. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used three network structures to control for the endogenous network effects of prior Oncofertility coauthorships relation to future coauthorship of related publica- tions: density, transitive triads, and the number of actor pairs at Distance 2. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;den- sity controls for the overall “baseline” propensity of any two researchers in the field to coauthor a publication. Like the intercept term in a regression or a grand mean in ANOVA, this measure reflects the probability of two researchers coauthoring a publi- cation in the area of Oncofertility if nothing is known (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, transitive triads control for researchers’ proclivities to coauthor Oncofertility publica- tions with their prior coauthors’ prior coauthors and focuses on the formation of new coauthorship ties, while the number of actor pairs at Distance 2 controls for the inverse tendency of researchers to keep their coauthors’ prior coauthors at two degrees of separation by not coauthoring with them and focuses on the dissolution of ties in order to create a distance of 2. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used prior coauthorship of non-Oncofertility publications by researchers as an exogenous network control for future coauthorship of publications in the area of Oncofertility. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we extracted each scientific article published by the 1,345 researchers in the data set prior to the start of their Oncofertility collaborations. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesized variables. Our three hypothesized independent variables are cognitive similarity, gender similarity, and country similarity. Cognitive similarity was measured as citation similarity between two researchers using the Jaccard similarity coefficient. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we coded the researcher’s gender as 1 for female and 0 for male and we identified a total of 34 unique countries, with the United States of America being the most represented (35.59%, see the appendix). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gender similarity and country similarity were calculated as 1 or 0, with 1 indicating a pair of actors having the same gender, or being from the same country. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diversity and homophily hypotheses were tested using SIENA, stochastic actor- oriented models for network dynamics (Snijders, Van de Bunt, &amp;amp; Steglich, 2010). This statistical model simulates the evolution of the network, using discrete observations over time, and estimates parameters for the underlying mechanisms of network dynam- ics between these discrete, incremental observations by combining random utility models, Markov processes, and simulation. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;read SIENA, Snijders et al 2010 (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SIENA model is appropriate, as the dependent variable innovation is operationalized as a network tie, consisting of coau- thorship among two individuals publishing in the field of Oncofertility. In addition, an examination of the emergence of coauthorship ties requires a longitudinal approach which is offered by this model. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oncofertility Network Evolution and Descriptive Statistics (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;87% of the publi- cations reviewed were the result of multiauthor collaborations. Our results also show that 21% of researchers were involved in more than one team, a significant number given that we only observed teams whose work was published over a 4-year period. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 reports the changes within the Oncofertility col- laboration network over time, with the number of ties changing from 0 (no collaboration) to 1 (collaboration). Here we find that changes from 0 → 1 are greater than the number of ties changing from 1 → 0 between subsequent years. Thus, each year, more ties were created than dissolved. These results indicate that the network grew over the duration of our study, a result evident in Figure 1 (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in Figure 1 and Table 2, the density of the Oncofertility coauthor- ship relation is very low in all 4 years. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypotheses Testing (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 3 reports the correlation matrix and Table 4 the results of the coevolution model based on stochastic actor-based models. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 1 predicted that individuals possessing expertise in different knowledge or research areas are more likely to produce innovative ideas through collaboration. The results of the model indicate a negative and significant effect for cognitive simi- larity (−0.04, p &amp;lt; .05). A negative effect indicates dissimilarity in knowledge and hence such a result supports Hypothesis 1. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 2 predicted that individuals are more likely to achieve innovation with others of the same gender, drawing on arguments about attraction and ease of com- munication among similar people. However, we did not find support for this hypoth- esis (−0.02, p &amp;gt; .05), suggesting that diversity based on gender in not necessarily beneficial to collaboration. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Hypothesis 3 predicted that individuals are more likely to achieve innova- tion when collaborating with others within the same country. This hypothesis was supported (0.91, p &amp;lt; .05), revealing that despite the advance of ICTs and researchers’ familiarity with technology, distance continues to inhibit the creation of scientific innovation by teams (Cummings &amp;amp; Kiesler, 2005). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found density to be significant and negative (−2.56, p &amp;lt; .05), suggest- ing that the costs of collaboration preempt researchers from creating coauthorship ties with random others. The transitive triad parameter on the other hand was found to be positive and significant (0.64, p &amp;lt; .05), suggesting that there is indeed a tendency for researchers to collaborate with “friends of their friends,” or more accurately prior coauthors’ of their prior coauthors. Consistent with this finding, estimates for the num- ber of actor pairs at Distance 2 is negative and significant, signaling a tendency toward network closure. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also controlled for the exogenous network effects of prior coauthorship on non- Oncofertility publications. The results show that researchers are more likely to engage in new collaborations in this field with those whom they have previously collaborated with on non-Oncofertility collaborations (0.47, p &amp;lt; .05). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together with net findings about cognitive dissimilarity, this study suggests that innovation in net- worked research is most likely when teams draw on individuals with diverse knowl- edge resources, but who also have prior collaborations with each other or with common others. The key to sustaining innovation in such teams is to reduce the possibility that (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid adoption of smartphones and their increased sensing capabilities make it possible to collect a large amount of multi-modality mobile sensing data, which tend to be diverse, dynamic, and may vary significantly across users and applications. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we identify the key characteristics and design challenges for large-scale mobile sensing and analytics, which are then demonstrated through three case studies in environmental monitoring, transportation electrification, and mobile video chat. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale mobile sensing and analytics is becoming a reality. On the one hand, large amounts of multi-modality mobile sensing data (e.g., GPS location, acceleration, lighting, audio, video) can be captured by individual mobile phones. On the other hand, such rich sets of mobile sensing data, together with data available from the Web or other sources (e.g., tweets, news articles, weather information), need to be carefully analyzed and processed (on the fly) in order to support knowledge discovery, user feedback, and decision making. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESIGN CHALLENGES (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Personalized mobile sensing and analytics (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personalization requires the identification (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of a user’s specific characteristics (e.g., mobility pattern, driving behavior) and current contexts (e.g., walking, indoor, quiet). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we consider a mobile sensing system for monitoring users’ driving behaviors and analyzing their impacts on the energy efficiency of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and the environment [2]. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Collaborative sensing and analytics (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging social groups and online social communities, socially collaborative data sensing and analytics can be particularly useful. Collaboration can occur in situ (e.g., with neighboring devices) or over the Internet via data sharing and community-based forums (e.g., average fuel efficiency of other people driving a Prius). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our SafeVchat system aims to determine whether a user is misbehaving through the fusion of multiple image-based classifiers (e.g., face, nose, eye, upper body, skin color) [5]. Sampling video frames and analyzing images can be time consuming, and different classifiers may perform differently for different users’ video chat data. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Privacy and security (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data gathered by and stored in people’s mobile phones are often highly personal and sensitive, such as geo-tagged and timestamped sensor readings or audio/video recordings. Therefore, remote processing or data mining of mobile sensing data, or collaboration among a large number of mobile devices always raise serious privacy and security concerns. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASE STUDIES (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAQS, a mobile sensing system for personalized indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring [1]. IAQ is affected by different air pollutants, and can vary substantially by room, time, location, activity, etc. As people’s mobility patterns also vary, personalized IAQ monitoring and online user feedback are very useful but challenging. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

However,  In essence, the findings derived from the learning analytics process failed to generate the sense of urgency or motivation for change as it related to technology adoption within the institution. “Critical interpretation of the implications of data describing the institution’s current LMS use was almost entirely absent.  A focus on technological issues merely generates “urgency” around technical systems and integration concerns, and fails to address the complexities and challenges of institutional culture and change.”  Challenges with adoption: “Although social systems such as educational institutions do evolve and change over time, they are inherently resistant to change and designed to neutralize the impact of attempts to bring about change (Kavanagh &amp;amp; Ashkanasy, 2006). This reality is reflected in Rogers’ theory of diffusion of innovation (1995), which attempts to model the factors that determine the adoption rate of (or, conversely, resistance to) new innovations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion part is especially good, pointing out cultural issues that are obstacles of adoption and institutional change. This could be connected with the micro-level challenges and needs to encourage cultural change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“social and cultural change (that is, change in habits, practices and behaviours) is not brought about by simply giving people large volumes of logical data (Kotter &amp;amp; Cohen, 2002).   Interpretation and meaning-making, however, are contingent upon a sound understanding of the specific institutional context. As the field of learning analytics continues to evolve we must be cognizant of the necessity for ensuring that any data analysis is overlaid with informed and contextualized interpretations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;abstract This article examines the relationship between structural location (namely, degree centrality) and news media coverage. Our central hypothesis is that the network centrality of social movement actors is positively associated with the prevalence of actors being cited in the print news media. This paper uses two-mode data from a communication network of environmentalists in British Columbia, and examines the relationship between their structural location and the frequency by which they are cited in newsprint media with regard to particular frames (about forest conservation, environmental protest, and related issues). We asked a sample of social movement participants about their ties to a target list of relatively high profile actors (environmental activists). We turned the resulting network matrix into a bipartite graph that examined the relationships amongst the target actors vis a vis the respondents. Next we calculated point in-degree for the target actors. For the target actors we also have data from a representative sample of 957 print news articles about forestry and conservation of old growth forests in British Columbia. We compare the effects of network centrality of the target actor versus several attributes of the target actors (gender, level of radicalism, leadership status) on the amount of media coverage that each of the target actors receives. We find that network centrality is associated with media coverage controlling for actor attributes. We discuss theoretical implications of this research. Finally, we also discuss the methodological pros and cons of using a “target name roster” to construct two-mode data on social movement activists. (p. 148)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between social movements and media has long been viewed as a complex and dynamic interaction. (p. 148)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper we contribute to this discussion from a distinctive angle, asking whether media coverage of social movements is affected by the properties of the activists mobilizing within them. (p. 148)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we introduce an explicit relational dimension to analysis, by exploring the correlation between media coverage and the position that activists occupy within movement networks. Building on earlier contributions (Diani, 2003), we ask in particular whether media attention to specific activists is positively related to their centrality in movement networks. (p. 148)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Attributes versus relational properties (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four specific source characteristics are considered in this study. Three of them refer to standard individual attributes, namely: (1) whether or not the source is radical; (2) the source’s gender; and (3) whether or not the source holds a formal leadership position in some movement organization. The fourth property is, in contrast, a relational property, as it consists of the source’s centrality in the movement’s communication network. (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literature (p. 149)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1. Mediaandsocialmovements’impact (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Radicalism (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some believe that media selects content based on the dual objectives of maximizing profit and market share (Croteau and Hoynes, 2003; McAdam et al., 1996), and most typically these objectives are met by covering issues in a contentious, exciting, or sensationalized way. (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major problem is, of course, what factors may affect the relationship between media and movements, and more specifically, the former’s attention to the latter’s stances and actions. (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have pointed at the role of frames (Goffman, 1974), namely, interpretive packages that condense and summarize the facts of the world ‘out there’ in a way that eases our understanding of them (Benford, 1993a,b; Gamson, 1992; Snow et al., 1986; Snow and Benford, 1988). Collective action frames may be intentionally and strategically formulated by social movements – and analogously by their opponents – to garner general public support for their cause and to attract and mobilize potential constituents (Gamson and Modigliani, 1989; Noy, 2009; Scheufele, 1999; Snow et al., 1986; Snow and Benford, 1988). Frames are also simultaneously used by media to simplify presentation of complicated issues in the course of reporting the news (Anderson, 1997; Dispensa and Brulle, 2003; Gamson et al., 1992; Ryan, 1991; Scheufele, 1999; Tuchman, 1978). (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others, however, suggest that radical views and behaviours are too far outside the norm and actually serve to confuse matters (Fitzgerald and Rodgers, 2000; Rootes, 2007; Snow and Benford, 1992). (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other observers have stressed the asymmetrical dependency between social movements and media, with the former much more dependent on the latter than the other way around (Entman and Rojecki, 1993; Gitlin, 1980; McCarthy et al., 1996; Baylor, 1996; Klandermans and Goslinga, 1996; Gamson and Modigliani, 1989; Carroll and Hackett, 2006). (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4. Gender (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Merchant (1997) estimates that globally, roughly 80 percent of grassroots environmental activists are female. (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Merchant (1997) also notes that a distinct minority of these women are actually formal leaders. (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.7. Analyticstrategyandhypotheses (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, correlational analyses are utilized to explore particular bivariate relationships. Second, multiple regression analyses are used to explore hypotheses regarding the relationships between three of the independent variables (social network centrality, leadership, gender and radicalism) and the dependent variable. Finally, interviews with print-news media-workers who were key players in covering the British Columbia forestry conflict are used to supplement findings, adding further insight to the interpretation of the results. (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.5. Formalleadershiproles (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;leaders strive to garner general public support for the movement’s cause and promote mobilization of constituents (Snow and Benford, 1988). (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H1. Formal leaders will have higher communication-network centrality scores than non-leaders. (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.6. Socialnetworkcentrality (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H2. Formal leadership will be positively associated with media coverage. (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Leaders’ are defined in terms of factors such as influence, authority, and status, rather than formal roles (Diani, 1995, 2003; Nepstad and Bob, 2006). (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H3. Network centrality will be positively associated with media coverage. (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Freeman (1979:219) states: “With respect to communication, a point [actor] with relatively high degree [centrality] is somehow ‘in the thick of things’.” (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H4. Males will be more likely to be leaders than females (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actors’ centrality in a movement’s communication network would then grant them control over the flow and transmission of information. (p. 150)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H5. Women will have relatively higher centrality scores than males. (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thedata (p. 151)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper we combine evidence from two initially unrelated data sets. The first consists of relational (and some attribute) data for 34 individuals active in the environmental movement in the Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia regions in the late 1980s and early 1990s.3 Their media coverage is measured by drawing upon a database containing records of print-news media citations relating to the forestry conflict in western British Columbia between 1986 and 1992. In addition, qualitative data from faceto-face interviews held with key news-workers operating in the field during the 1980s and 1990s are also used to supplement the findings and discussion. (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H6. Radicals will be less covered than moderates. (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thestudy (p. 151)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. Theforestryconflictandtheenvironmentalmovementin British Columbia (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1. Socialnetworkdata (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social network data were collected for prior studies of the underlying structure and functioning of environmental movement groups active in the British Columbia forestry conflict (see Tindall, 1994, 2002; Tindall et al., 2003). (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a survey was conducted of 28 activists who were part of the environmental movement. Amongst other questions, they were asked to indicate whether they had ties to a predetermined list of individuals active in the forestry conflict. (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We refer to the people who were interviewed as the “respondents”. (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire allowed the 28 respondents (egos) to indicate ties to a wide range of actors (targets) who participated in the forestry debates, including members of environmental groups, individual activists, representatives of business, politicians, union leaders, and First Nation representatives. (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting dataset consisted of a two-mode (28 egos×34 targets), single-relation sociomatrix, where each cell xij equalled 1 if ego i had a tie to target j; otherwise the cell value was 0. (p. 152)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;their seminal contributions: diagnostic frames, involving not only identifying the problem, but also attribution of cause, blame, or culpability for the situation to someone or some group; prognostic frames, consisting of statements meant to explore and define possible solutions to the problem and strategies meant to resolve them; and motivational frames, consisting of what Benford and Snow (2000:617) quite simply described as a moral “call to arms.” (p. 152)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2. Citationdata (p. 152)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an indicator of media coverage we adopted the number of times that the 34 environmental movement activists (‘targets’) we just mentioned were cited in the press. (p. 152)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;each of the 19 keywords was later classified as illustrations of one of the core framing tasks identified by Snow and Benford (1988) in (p. 152)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.3. Datamanagementanddatafilecreation (p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 957 news articles contained in the citation database account for a total of 22,004 total citations. (p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;210 of these citations were from environmental social movement organization members that were listed as targets in the social network instrument (p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results (p. 153)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from Table 3 we see that the leadership measure though somewhat sizable (r = .29) is not significantly associated with the centrality score, thus failing to support H1. (p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this information was compiled in a single SPSS data file (p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with regard to H2, we see from Table 3 that the formal leadership indicator is not statistically significantly related to citations (p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Table 3 we also see support for H3 when we note that the network centrality score is very significantly, positively associated with citations. Thus, those who were more central to the movement’s communication network actually got more attention from the press (p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the correlation between gender and formal leadership is not significant (p. 154)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gender is not associated with social network centrality, thus failing to support H5 (p. 154)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the relationship between radicalism and gender is significant, but with a negative correlation, suggesting that, all else being equal, women were more likely to be radical than men. (p. 154)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 4 shows the results for an individual quasi-Poisson generalized linear model,13 where media coverage (number of total citations) is evaluated as function of network centrality, plus the four actor attributes. (p. 154)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, we found that formal leaders were not the most central actors in the movement’s communication network, nor were they significantly associated with rates of citation, while the most central actors were actually cited the most. (p. 154)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, there is evidence to suggest that leadership and communication network centrality in the BC wilderness preservation movement are indeed different phenomena.12 (p. 154)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the fact that activists who were more central in the movement communication network were also more cited in the press is consistent with studies like Diani’s (2003). (p. 155)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the fact that moderates get stronger coverage than radicals might be at least partially at odds with the fact that highly contentious, possibly violent protest events have much better chances of being reported than more moderate ones (Koopmans and Rucht, 2002, 246–251). (p. 155)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporters indicate that covering drama admittedly has some initial appeal, and is often necessary given the scale and scope of certain protest events such as the events surrounding Clayoquot Sound. More important, however, these reporters also state that when covering ongoing conflicts, at some point a shift must be made towards reporting on the underlying issues. (p. 155)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present study we adopt an approach that overcomes a number of these challenges. Because the target individuals on the network instrument were identified through public sources, this avoids the IRB problem (p. 155)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

Teaching and Teacher Education, 1–6. &lt;a href=&#34;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2016.07.009&#34;&gt;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2016.07.009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an editorial of a very timely issue on data literacy of teachers, to be published in &lt;em&gt;Teaching and Teacher Education&lt;/em&gt;. This editorial highlights several crosscutting concepts in this area: (a) the need for continuous learning around data e the where and when; (b) the need to integrate data skills with content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge and link the data skills to other aspects of effective teaching; &amp;copy; the sustainability of impact; (d) models of effective professional learning and the impact of collaborative inquiry and data teaming; and (e) the logic model on impact of data use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these aspects, what is of special interest to me is that Jimerson et al (this issue) take &amp;ldquo;the need for data literacy a step beyond teachers to include students themselves as primary data users&amp;rdquo;, which corresponds to my attempts to give students access to social network data in an online class. Another quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the five essential recommendations posed by Hamilton et al. (2009), based on an extensive literature review, was for students to become their own data-driven decision makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this issue is an important, timely addition to the literature and would be of interest to many parties (e.g., teacher ed programs, academic tech offices at universities, Unizin) and research communities (e.g., learning analytics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;building blocks for data use must be laid in teacher preparation programs (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2016; Reeves &amp;amp; Honig, 2015), (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using data in education is not new; it has been around for a long time. However, the emphases for education to become evidence-based have been increasing in many countries. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the acquisition of data literacy to traditional forms of professional development is risky at best. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the emphases and the recognition that teachers must be equipped with data, little comprehensive effort has been made to improve the capacity of educators to use data effectively and responsibly through teacher preparation programs and explicit requirements for licensure. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding is scarce for professional development and many schools may consider data use to be peripheral, opting instead to focus on topics that are considered more pressing. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For data use to be woven into day-to-day practice, rather than being perceived as an “add-on” to the hard work teachers already do, continuous learning must occur throughout one’s career (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-cutting topics: what’s important for learning about data (p. 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoogland et al. (this issue) note the importance of data literacy and beliefs in data use. Mandinach and Gummer (this issue) outline a construct, data literacy for teachers, that contains some 53 skills and sources of knowledge teachers need to use data effectively and responsibly. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics include: (a) the need for continuous learning around data e the where and when; (b) the need to integrate data skills with content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge and link the data skills to other aspects of effective teaching; &amp;copy; the sustainability of impact; (d) models of effective professional learning and the impact of collaborative inquiry and data teaming; and (e) the logic model on impact of data use. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamental to the conceptual framework is that data skills for teaching must be surrounded by several forms of knowledge, most specifically content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge (Gummer &amp;amp; Mandinach, 2015). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Farrell and Marsh (this issue) as well as Van Gasse, Vanlommel, Vanhoof, and Van Petegem (this issue) find few instances of transformed instruction as a result of data use suggests that a gap exists in how the field supports teachers to develop just this capacity. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.1. Continuous learning (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most commercial professional development providers of data use admit that they do not go far enough to connect to the pedagogy (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2013) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mandinach and Gummer (2013, 2016) lay out the rationale for why schools of education must step up to begin to address the lack of human capacity around data skills. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparation programs must introduce data use to teacher candidates, who must then have data use-related knowledge, skills, and dispositions reinforced through in-service training and professional development throughout their respective careers. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question we must raise is what is the base level of each type of knowledge (e.g., data skills, content knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge) required to serve as a starting place for effective data use? The field needs to explore the relationships among these skill sets. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;every educator must have some passing knowledge of inquiry, data collection, data interpretation, and application to instructional planning and delivery. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimerson, Cho, and Wayman (this issue) for example, highlight the ways in which in-service teachers may struggle to fit data to practice when data-related concepts have not been well-introduced in teacher preparation programs. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the absence of solid mental models for data use (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Means, Chen, DeBarger, and Padilla (2011) found, teachers with good data skills who work in collaborative teams can compensate and backfill for other teachers who lack such skills. But as van Gasse et al (this issue) note, collaboration does not occur automatically, having found little collaboration among teachers on data use. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher beliefs about data use matter, and so learning around data must address not only the technical aspects of data use (e.g., accessing systems or interpreting reports) but also the assumptions teachers make about what data “count” and whether or how data use benefits students. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2. Data skills: an integrated approach (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.3. What is effective teaching and how are we measuring it? (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the five essential recommendations posed by Hamilton et al. (2009), based on an extensive literature review, was for students to become their own data-driven decision makers. But for students to be data literate, teachers first need to have the necessary skills, knowledge, and dispositions that are part of data literacy. They must then be able to facilitate the development of these skills and dispositions among their students in appropriate ways; this is a lofty goal, and one not without challenges. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van den Hurk, Houtveen, and Van de Grift (this issue) discuss effective teaching. What is interesting about this article is that it outlines an instrument that contains 24 items related to effective teaching, yet not one item explicitly pertains to data use. This reflects a hole in the current literature where there still is no recognition of the importance of data use in teachers’ practice, or where exists only a surface recognition of data use as merely tangential to other components of practice (e.g., feedback, assessment, or planning for remediation). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.4. Sustainability of impact (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data use must become an integral and integrated component of educators’ work, just like any other method. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educators must recognize the utility of data use and its possible impact. But the data must be useful, informative, and actionable. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Poortman and Schildkamp (this issue) article raises the issue of sustainability by noting the need for continued support. Jimerson et al (this issue) point out that even “true believers” in student-involved data use note frustrations and challenges that, unless addressed, may dissuade others from even trying to adopt such practices; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lai and McNaughton (this issue) have outlined a three-year model that tests the limits of feasibility. How many school districts can afford three years of professional development in terms of practical and financial constraints? How many school districts have the same educators after three years, given high rates of mobility? (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, several of these articles provide different peeks into how data are woven into professional learning experiencesdimplicitly or explicitly. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Van den Hurk et al (this issue) piece provides an in-depth look at a process in which teachers use structured and reflective data on a number of teaching behaviors visa-vis video observations and feedback loops. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Means, Padilla, and Gallagher (2010) found the importance of sustained support around data use. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of importance here is a finding that Mandinach and Friedman (2015) noted in case studies of exemplary data-oriented teacher preparation programs. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Poortman and Schildkamp (this issue) piece provides another interesting twist by employing a methodology that allows for effectiveness to be measured specific to the problems-to-besolved among data teams. In the model described by this article, teachers not only use data to explore and address problems of local import, but learn about data use in context as they do so. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farrell and Marsh (this issue) raise a similar issue about embedding data use in a strong school culture (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Farrell and Marsh (this issue) piece also suggests that classroom change happensdmost likelydas collaborative groups of teachers work toward instructional improvements, supported by external and internal data; again, we see a different take on teacher learning that still highlights a learning-by-doing orientation when it comes to using data. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.5. Models of effective professional learning (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jimerson et al (this issue) article takes the need for data literacy a step beyond teachers to include students themselves as primary data users; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread throughout the pieces is that, by building capacity for data use, teachers can be empowered to drive their own learning in ways that are sensitive to the specific needs of the local contextdthey need not always wait on a school or system leader to determine professional development needs. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van den Hurk et al (this issue) cite work by Wayman and Jimerson (2014) on the characteristics needed for effective professional learning. They include: collaboration, engagement, context, embedding in the job circumstances, intensity, and coherence. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.7. Logic model on impact of data use (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlying data use is the expectation that data-driven decision making will improve student performance. The logic model is multi-part: (a) train teachers to use data; (b) there will be an impact on classroom practice; and &amp;copy; those practices will lead to improved student performance. Poortman and Schildkamp (this issue) and Lai and McNaughton (this issue) mention part of this logic model and raise questions about it, but perhaps we should all question the seductive nature of such a simple logic model for how data use works. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berliner (2006), in an article based on a rousing keynote address at AERA in 2005, noted that there are many things beyond the control of teachers, such as childhood health issues, poverty, hunger, and lack of parental support. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.6. Collaborative inquiry and data teaming (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore of little surprise that the rigorous studies (Carlson, Borman, &amp;amp; Robinson, 2011; Konstantopoulos, Miller, &amp;amp; van der Ploeg, 2013) found mixed results on the impact of data use on student achievement. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for data teaming to function effectively, there must be certain structures and process in place. School leadership must provide the needed resources and time for teams to meet. Leadership must create an open, trusting, and nonevaluative environment in which team members can discuss issues and feel free to dissent or even admit their challenges. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, what we should not dissuade us from doing what we can do to support student learning, supported by data. We would therefore suggest talking about the logic model and focusing on the linkages between preparation on data use or using data on what happens in the classroom. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concluding thoughts (p. 4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet collaboration looks different in each of the articles. Van Gasse et al (this issue) use collaborative exercises around student learning outcomes. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lai and McNaughton (this issue) focus on building leaders for data teaming (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across contexts, we see data use not as a clear, linear process of neatly sorting students into tutoring groups by areas of need, but as a messy, iterative process that requires critical thinking skills, innovation, a dogged determination to inspect ourselves and our contexts, and to play the role of educational detectives to seek out root contributors to student (and system) underperformance. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the field must consider data more broadly, beyond assessment data. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, with increasing problems with data security in many venues, it is essential for educators to understand how to use data responsibly. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also see a concern for appropriate use of data by teachersda recognition that data use is not an inherent good, but that it must be implemented in ways that are ethical and which treat data use as a means to an end, rather than an end in and of itself. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this collection of papers we see increased attention devoted to examining how data informs not only teaching, but how it informs teachers themselves in terms of reflective practice. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, if we are serious about data use being woven into practice, and being used in conjunction with pedagogical content knowledge as well as content knowledge, we must challenge the field to push beyond studies that use “data use” as a keyword to see whether and how elements of data use appear in studies in the content areas. Similarly, what relevant literature might we miss because the research appears in a publication that may not be easily available in other countries? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the distinction between data literacy and assessment literacy (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2016; also this issue), the field must look beyond student achievement and test results as a primary indicator of impact of data use. Thus, the field also needs more work that measures diverse outcomes of data use in action; this meaning including not just typical achievement-oriented student outcomes, but also affective, conative, behavioral, and other metrics. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the necessary progress, several key challenges must be overcome. One challenge is to ensure that all educators know how to use data effectively and responsibly. This barrier requires action by educator preparation programs, professional development providers, school systems, and other relevant stakeholders. This means that educators must be exposed to data literacy as early as possible and then have data literacy reinforced throughout their careers (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2016; also this issue).

&lt;p&gt;Second, there still needs to be a common and accepted language of what it means for educators to be data literate. This has been the goal of the work of Mandinach and Gummer and the Data Quality Campaign (2014) in positing definitions. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A foundational piece in the special issue laying out an evolving framework of Data Literacy for Teachers (DLFT). This paper introduces the history of the framework, presents its components, and discusses next steps different parties should take to foster data literacy among teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article reports on the evolution of a conceptual framework for a construct called data literacy for teachers. Data use has become an emphasis in education but few educators have received sufficient training or preparation pertaining to data literacy skills. This article lays out the framework, identifying the specific knowledge, skills, and dispositions teachers need to use data effectively and responsibly. It concludes with a call to schools of education and teacher preparation programs to begin to integrate data literacy into curricula and practical experiences. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating data literacy into teacher preparation (p. 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, education has struggled to define what it means to be a data literate educator (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2011, 2013a, 2016; Schildkamp &amp;amp; Kuiper, 2010). Until recently, the field has paid more attention to assessment literacy (Brookhart, 2011; Christoforidou, Kyriakides, Antoniou, &amp;amp; Creemeers, 2013; Gotch &amp;amp; French, 2014; Kahl, Hofman, &amp;amp; Bryant, 2013; Mandinach, 2014; Plake, 1993) (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data-literate educators continuously, effectively, and ethically access, interpret, act on, and communicate multiple types of data from state, local, classroom, and other sources to improve outcomes for students in a manner appropriate to educators&amp;rsquo; professional roles and responsibilities. (p. 1) (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Public Instruction is the only state in the United States that has deemed data use sufficiently important to develop a webpage on which they lay out to educators the meaning of data literacy. Data literacy is defined as “one&amp;rsquo;s level of understanding of how to find, evaluate, and use data to inform instruction” (p. 1). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work attempts to change the focus to all education data, not just assessment data, to provide a more comprehensive depiction of students. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data Quality Campaign&amp;rsquo;s definition (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fill that gap and address the need, we (Gummer &amp;amp; Mandinach, 2015; Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2016) have laid out a definition (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;data literacy for teachers (DLFT) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;barriers and enablers to the enculturation of data in at least five European countries, research is beginning to emerge, reflecting the growing importance of data use globally (Schildkamp &amp;amp; Lai, 2013; Schildkamp et al., 2013). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data literacy for teaching is the ability to transform information into actionable instructional knowledge and practices by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting all types of data (assessment, school climate, behavioral, snapshot, longitudinal, moment-to-moment, etc.) to help determine instructional steps. It combines an understanding of data with standards, disciplinary knowledge and practices, curricular knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and an understanding of how children learn. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much attention from policymakers in the United States has been given to the importance of teachers using data. Former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan (2009a, 2009b, 2009c, 2010a, 2010b, 2012) has spoken widely about the need for teachers to use data and the importance of such evidence-driven practice. In fact, at a national conference sponsored by the Data Quality Campaign, Duncan (2012) publically challenged schools of education to focus on and accelerate efforts to educate educators to use data. Further, data use is one of the four pillars in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, 2009) and in the Race to the Top (U.S. Department of Education, 2009), two major initiatives from the U. S. Department of Education. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work is grounded on three propositions that have emerged from our six years of studying data literacy. First, there is no question that educators must be armed with data. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional organizations such as the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) have included the capacity to use data among their recommendations and standards. The National Board of Professional Teaching Standards also has advocated for teachers&amp;rsquo; data literacy (Aguerrebere, 2009; Thorpe, 2014). A Blue Ribbon Panel (2010) report released by NCATE, CAEP&amp;rsquo;s predecessor, and endorsed by Duncan (2010b) recommended that teacher candidates know how to make data-driven decisions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is a problematic conflation between assessment literacy and data literacy. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third and most relevant to teacher preparation around use data, our findings have indicated that simply relying on professional development to enhance teachers’ data literacy is inadequate (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2016). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCSSO (2013, 2015) released the InTASC (Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium) standards for teaching that articulated 10 standards infused with data literacy, each standard identifying various forms of knowledge, dispositions, and performance skills that are required of teachers. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is our belief based on our prior work, that teacher preparation programs must begin to introduce data use to teacher candidates, with professional development further enhancing the skills. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.1. Positioning data use in policy and research (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.1.1. Policy and policymakers (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue speaks to the conflation of assessment and data literacy, a major issue plaguing the comprehensive adoption of data literacy in education; that is, people think that data are only about assessments, and this is far from the case (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2016; Mandinach et al., 2015). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data Quality Campaign, a bipartisan advocacy organization, has been a strong proponent of improving data literacy among educators. They have provided multiple supports and activities including: A paper, Empowering Teachers with Data: Policies and Practices to Promote Educator Data Literacy (Data Quality Campaign, 2014a). A national event to promote and increase awareness about data literacy was held (Data Quality Campaign, 2014b). A webinar to debate the differences between data literacy and assessment literacy (Data Quality Campaign, 2014c). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conceptual framework for data literacy for teachers (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1. Evolution of the framework (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first effort to understand data literacy involved convening 55 experts to determine how they defined the construct (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2012, 2013a). We first examined how published materials, resources, and books dealt with data literacy. Second, we required each expert to provide a definition of data literacy. Third, we asked them to differentiate between data literacy and assessment literacy. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review of the professional materials indicated that the texts focused on inquiry cycles, different types of data, and the role of data analysis to inform decisions. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.1.2. Research (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, policymakers are further along in their thinking about data literacy among educators than are researchers. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many articles and studies have noted the importance for teachers to know how to use data effectively to inform their practice and the need to build educators’ capacity to use data (Baker, 2003; Choppin, 2002; Feldman &amp;amp; Tung, 2001; Hamilton et al., 2009; Ikemoto &amp;amp; Marsh, 2007; Mandinach &amp;amp; Honey, 2008; Mason, 2002; Mandinach, 2009, 2012; Miller, 2009). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the knowledge and skills were sorted into the following categories: inquiry process, habits of mind, data quality, data properties, data use procedural skills, transformation of data to information, and transformation of information to implementation. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent project, we conducted an analysis of state licensure documents to understand how data literacy skills were described, if at all (Mandinach, Parton, Gummer, &amp;amp; Anderson, 2015a). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though having good professional development is important, there also is a pressing need for the infrastructure to support the infusion of data use into schools and districts (Marsh, Pane, &amp;amp; Hamilton, 2006) and in teacher preparation programs (Duncan, 2012; Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2013b, 2016). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our examination yielded interesting yet unsurprising findings. Assessment literacy was a more prevalent skill required by states than data literacy. However, some states articulated the knowledge and skills that pertain to data literacy as part of their requirements. Some states (Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee) even had an explicit data competency and a developmental continuum from novice to expert for data use. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the existing literature focuses on the practicing cohort of teachers with an emphasis on in-service training, and professional development, little attention had been devoted to teacher preparation and data literacy in pre-service programs. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we convened a meeting of key stakeholders to discuss what schools of education can do to prepare educators to use data. The outcome of that meeting was a call to action (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2011) that appeared in the Educational Researcher (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2013b). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message that emerged following our analyses of the data from the meeting with the experts and our review of licensure requirements is that for teachers, data literacy must be integrated with other essential aspects of teaching, namely knowledge of content domain and pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986, 1987). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore conceptualized an interaction among three components, content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and data use for teaching (what we termed the knowledge and skills around data use). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. What DLFT looks like now (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conceptual framework (Mandinach &amp;amp; Gummer, 2016) therefore was elaborated to include the full scope of Shulman’s (1987) foundational knowledge. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have now included seven key knowledge areas that integrate with data use in the inquiry process: content knowledge; general pedagogical knowledge; curriculum knowledge; pedagogical content knowledge; knowledge of learners and their characteristics; knowledge of educational contexts; and knowledge of educational ends, purposes and values. These areas provide essential information and feed into the data use for teaching domain of the DLFT construct. The data use for teaching domain is then comprised of five components under which we have associated specific knowledge and skills. The domains include: identify problems and frame questions, use data, transform data into information, transform information into a decision, and evaluate outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;assets/1-s2.0-S0742051X16301391-gr1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2.1. Identify problems and frame questions (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying knowledge and skills initiate the iterative inquiry process. Teachers should be able to: Articulate a problem of practice about a student, group of students, a topical area, the curriculum, or an aspect of instruction. They should be able to identify the problem and explain the issue or question. Understand the context at the student level to understand the problem with a student or a group of students. Contextualize the learning, behavioral, or motivation issues students may be having will help them to better understand the situation, concretizing the problem that can lead to a decision and subsequent action. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand the context at the school level. This is a different level of aggregation from student level context. Understand the larger context of a school in which teachers&amp;rsquo; practice is embedded provides a broad view toward seeking solutions to problems of practice. Involve other participants or stakeholders, including students. Other educators, parents, and students can provide valuable insights into students&amp;rsquo; performance. Consultation with them is an important part of the decision-making process. Understand student privacy. It is increasingly important for teachers to understand the regulations around the protection of student privacy and confidentiality. Data breaches have been increasing at alarming rates and education is not immune. This skill set includes knowing how to discuss data and with whom, understanding data sharing, among other topics. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2.2. Use data (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest component in the inquiry cycle is Use Data. This component pertains to the fundamental knowledge and skills that most directly relate to actual data use. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have identified 27 skills under the Use Data component. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identify possible sources of data. Teachers must be able to evaluate the right data for the particular problem of interest, data that are aligned at the problem of practice and actionable. Understand the purposes of different data sources. Teachers must understand the purpose of different data because different data have different uses and utility. Understand how to generate data. Generating data is important because not all data are already produced. Teachers generate a plethora of data every day, ranging from moment to moment assessments of students to more long-term determinations of students&amp;rsquo; understanding. Understand assessment. Teachers need to understand what makes a sound assessment. They must understand the different kinds of assessments, their purposes, and their uses. ▪ Use formative and summative assessments. Teachers must know how to use both formative and summative assessments, including understanding when which sources of data are appropriate for instructional versus assessment/grading decision making is a key skill for teachers. These sources of data yield different kinds of information that may be more or less aligned to instructional practice. ▪ Develop sound assessment design and implementation. Teachers must be able to develop assessments whether by hand or through the use of assessment systems. This set of knowledge and skills entails knowing how to design items and combine them into a meaningful test that yields reliable and valid data. ▪ Understand data properties. Data have characteristics and qualities that teachers need to understand and have alignment with the purposes of data use. Data have different levels (e.g., total score, composite, strand, item-level) and these levels may be more appropriate for different questions. ▪ Use multiple measures/sources of data. This is a foundational concept in data-driven decision making and educational measurement; that is, it is important not to rely on just one measure but to triangulate among multiple sources of data to obtain a better and more accurate depiction of the situation. ▪ Use qualitative and quantitative data. Most educators think of data as numbers that can be quantified. Data are much more. It is important to recognize that not all data are quantitative and that qualitative indices can be valued and informative sources. ▪ Understand specificity of data to question/problem. This set refers to the knowledge and skills teachers must have to understand that some data can address the issue being examined, while other data will not. ▪ Understand what data are appropriate. Teachers must be able to understand that not all data are appropriate or applicable for every given circumstance. It is important to recognize when specific data are or are not relevant for the problem at hand. Understand data quality. Data quality has many aspects such as validity, timeliness, and consistency of the data. Foundational to data use is knowing that the data being used are “clean”, timely in terms of from data collection to use, and valid for the purposes of use and interpretation. Data must not be misleading or out of range; that is, if the highest score possible is 100 and a score is entered as 110, teachers must recognize that there is a problem. Understand elements of data accuracy, appropriateness, and completeness. This is a subskill from the more general one about data quality. Data must be accurate. They also must be appropriate to the problem of practice or the question being addressed and as complete as possible. Using data that lack any of these qualities can invalidate the conclusions drawn from the data collection and analysis process. Understand how to access data. Teachers must know how data are stored and made available. They must be able to navigate across multiple data systems. Increasingly, educational data are stored in electronic formats for easy and safe access and analysis. Note that accessing data is different from generating data. The former entails data retrieval. The latter entails the actual creation of data. Find, locate, access, and retrieve data. Teachers must have the ability to locate the data needed to address a problem of practice or educational question and be able to pull out those data for subsequent examination. ▪ Use technologies to support data use. Teachers must know how to use technologies to support data use through data warehouses, assessment systems, student information systems, instructional management systems, data dashboards, simple spreadsheets, apps, and other relevant technologies that provide access to, analysis, and reporting of data. Understand how to analyze data. Teachers must understand what the data mean. Analyzing data enables the user to understand what the data mean, whether qualitative or quantitative. Analysis is one of the most foundational skills in data literacy. Understand statistics and psychometrics. Teachers need not be expert statisticians or psychometricans, but they must have a fundamental knowledge of both topics. By statistics we mean simple statistics such as central tendency and dispersion, not more advanced techniques like regression or ANOVA. By psychometrics, we mean understanding topics such as reliability, validity, and error of measurement. Manage data. Teachers must know how to manage data because there is such a multitude of data, that the wealth of data must be handled with accuracy, coded, stored, and arranged in a coherent manner for latter access and examination. Organize data into a meaningful and manageable representation of the information. Prioritize data because not all data are as relevant or as important as others. It is therefore important to arrange the data according to the utility of the issue being addressed. Examine data. Data examination means to scrutinize or inspect them in a meaningful way to address a particular question, hypothesis, or issue. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrate data by examining, analyzing, and combining them in some meaningful way for sense making. Manipulate data. Data manipulation entails handling or treating the data as part of the examination process. Drill down into data. Total test scores do not tell the complete story. Teachers need to drill down to strand or item levels to really understand misconceptions and understandings. Aggregate data. Teachers must understand that there are times when looking to whole group data is important. Disaggregate data. Teachers must understand the need to examine subgroup differences. They must know how to break down data into subgroups to discern differences across group performance. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determine next instructional steps. Based on the evidence that teachers have acquired, they must use those data to plan and determine what are the next logical steps to take instructionally. Monitor student performance. Teachers need to be able to watch student performance over time to determine if differences have occurred or changed behavior. Diagnose what students need. Teachers must know how to determine students&amp;rsquo; learning strengths and weakness from performance over time. Make instructional adjustments. Teachers must know how to make instructional adjustments based on data they have at hand. This means knowing what instructional actions are appropriate given the information gained from examining data. Understand the context for the decision. Teachers must understand the setting into which their decision is being fit. This includes knowing about the content, the curriculum, the scope and sequence, and other classroom contextual information. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2.3. Transform data into information (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2.5. Evaluate outcomes (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine skills were identified. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final component in the conceptual framework pertains to examining the impact of the decision making process. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the impact and consequences because the outcome of the inquiry process and decision is an impact on the circumstances that has consequences which can be either expected or unexpected. Generate hypothetical connections to instruction. Teachers must foresee how what they plan to do instructionally fits into the flow of students&amp;rsquo; learning and progress. To do this, they must know how to project hypothetically, what will happen if they take various courses of action. This is based on hypotheses or educated guesses about why things are happening the way they are and what might happen with different instructional steps. Test assumptions early in the inquiry cycle to help determine if teachers are on the right track or off target. Understand how to interpret data. Teachers must know what the data mean. Interpretation gives meaning to the data and provides explanations. Understand and use data displays and representations. Teachers need to know how to use data displays because data are often graphically depicted, in chart, tables, graphs, and other displays. Assess patterns and trends. Teachers must be able to discern patterns and trends from data, especially when displays in charts and graphs. Probe for causality, as an attempt to understand why the behavior, performance, or situation has happened. Use statistics. Teachers must be able to use simple statistics such as central tendency and dispersion to understand student performance. Synthesize diverse data. Teachers must know how to synthesize diverse data because often times, disparate data are applied to a problem and must be pulled together in a coherent manner in order for them to make sense. Articulate inferences and conclusions from the information analyzed during the inquiry process. Summarize and explain data to pull together an explanation of what the data and information mean. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-examine the original question or problem. Teachers must recognize the need to look back at the original problem or question to determine if the data and decision have addressed the original issue and what steps need to occur informed by that re-evaluation. Compare performance preand post-decision. Part of the inquiry process is checking to see if there has been a change from before a decision was made and action taken to afterwards. This is to determine the impact of that decision making process. Monitor changes in classroom practices. Part of evaluating the outcomes is observing what has happened in the classroom based on the actions taken from the decision. Teachers must continue to be aware of the changes to determine if they have been in the desired direction. Monitor student changes in performance. Teachers must observe changes in their students following a decision to determine if the decision and ensuing intervention has had the desired effect. Consider the need for iterative decision cycles. Fundamental to the decision making process is the notion of iterative cycles of inquiry. This means that decisions do not have an end point. Data are collected, analyzed, interpreted, and acted upon. Then the cycle begins anew. Teachers must recognize the iterative nature of the teaching and learning process. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2.6. Dispositions, habits of mind, or factors that influence data use (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substantial research has been conducted in this area and reflects an international perspective (Datnow, Park, &amp;amp; Kennedy-Lewis, 2012; Jimerson, 2013; Kerr, Marsh, Ikemoto, Darilek, &amp;amp; Barney, 2006; Schildkamp et al., 2013; Schildkamp &amp;amp; Kuiper, 2010; Schildkamp &amp;amp; Teddlie, 2008; Vanhoof, Verhaeghe, Van Petegem, &amp;amp; Valcke, 2012). These components are dispositions, beliefs, and habits of mind around data use (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2.4. Transform information into a decision (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five skills were identified. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are calling them dispositions as we agree with InTASC (2013) that these are more than just beliefs as they strongly structure what actions teachers undertake. Six dispositions were identified: (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our work, we recommend an integrated approach of data into pre-service preparation courses, especially because of the integration of Shulman&amp;rsquo;s (1987) seven areas of teacher knowledge. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belief that all students can learn. Teachers must believe that all students have the capacity to learn and what actions they take can have a positive effect on student performance. Belief in data/think critically. Teachers need to believe in the use of data, that data can help them do their jobs more effectively and to think deeply about the problem at hand while using the inquiry cycle to use data to inform a decision. Belief that improvement in education requires a continuous inquiry cycle. Improvement is a continuous cycle of tweaking things to see if they work, observing outcomes, and making modifications as needed. Teachers need to understand that their work is not a linear, cause-and-effect process, but a cyclical and ongoing process. Ethical use of data, including the protection of privacy and confidentiality of data. Of the utmost importance is the knowledge about how to protect student data in terms of privacy and confidentiality. This skill is increasingly important now that technological applications are making data use more efficient but also somewhat riskier in terms of data security. Teachers must understand the fundamental ways to use data securely and responsibly. Collaboration (vertically and horizontally). Collaboration is considered an important and valued component in the inquiry process where educators work together to examine data and seek solutions to a particular problem. Communication skills with multiple audiences. Teachers must be able to discuss results and performance with various audiences, using empirical evidence in the discussion. Audiences include students, parents, guardians, other educators, and other relevant stakeholders. They must be able to adapt their communication to the particular audience. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our opinion that integration has the best chance of providing the triangulated approach. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. How to integrate data literacy (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of both formative assessment and data literacy for teachers is the teacher knowledge and skills of learners and their characteristics. Without an understanding informed by the learning sciences of how students think and act, the teacher is at a disadvantage in determining how to structure learning experience. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implications: a systemic perspective on change (p. 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents looming questions and next steps that can be extrapolated from our work. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. The timing of introducing data literacy (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now believe that the earlier in teachers&amp;rsquo; careers, the better for the introduction of data-driven decision making. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of educational contexts is key to understanding how to act. Data at the school and district level can be incorporated into educational foundation courses to help pre-service teachers with experiences of what they will encounter when they start to teach. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools of education are the central and the major player in the system. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of education ends, purposes, and values is key to understanding from where the current focus on educational standards and tests has emerged. The data in the standards is not numerical, but the statements of what students need to know and be able to do that make up the Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts and Mathematics (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2010; 2015) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013) are at the heart of how teachers use data in the classroom to determine how well students are attaining educational goals and objectives. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data literacy is only one of many topics that now must be addressed as teacher preparation programs are reconsidered and restructured for continuous improvement. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State education agencies and their licensure components play a major role in the system. They design the regulations and requirements around the skills and knowledge teachers are required to have, and therefore what schools of education are required to provide to teacher candidates. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strongly considered leaving out general pedagogical knowledge and curriculum knowledge from our framework. Yet we asked ourselves how a teacher could use data to inform instruction without knowledge what curriculum is being used and how that curriculum relates to others. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School districts impact what teacher preparation programs do by exerting pressure to produce teacher candidates with certain skill sets to meet local needs. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, where we have emerged on these two issues reflects why schools of education and teacher preparation programs have a unique role in developing the capacity among teachers to use data effectively. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing organizations in the United States produce tests that teacher candidates must pass to obtain their certification. We know that the three major tests, Praxis and NOTE produced by Educational Testing Service (Sykes &amp;amp; Wilson, 2015), and edTPA (SCALE 2013) have introduced components that require test takers to demonstrate their ability to use and knowledge of data use concepts. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional organizations can leverage the importance of data literacy by impressing upon their members the need for educators to use data effectively and responsibly. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3. A systemic approach (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will summarize here some of the major players in the United States that are needed to facilitate systemic change. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional development providers can assist schools of education through the provision of existing materials and resources. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final player in the system is the U.S. Department of Education. Federal policymakers have made it known that teachers must use data and that education must become an evidence-driven profession. Yet the Department has done little to improve the capacity of educators to use data, short of providing the technological infrastructure at the state level to support data use. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.4. Next steps (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is a need for more research. We do not intend to have our conceptual framework be a static model. It will evolve and be modified over time as more knowledge of the field becomes further clarified. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;importance of protecting the privacy and confidentiality of student data (Mandinach et al., 2015a; Phi Delta Kappa, 2015). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, research could inform the field about how best to address the differing needs of teachers and teacher candidates across the developmental career continuum. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, research could address how role-based data literacy is; that is, how the knowledge and skill sets might differ for teachers, administrators, and other educators. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, it is unclear what the continuum of data literacy looks like. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of practical applications, schools of education will need assistance as they introduce data literacy into their programs. Faculty will need help as they plan how to integrate data literacy concepts into multiple courses. This will require retooling existing course materials. It will require faculty to acquire their own data literacy. The virtual course and the MOOC mentioned above can provide resources. However, we strongly advocate for the development of materials and resources that can be integrated into courses to minimize the potential resistance from faculty members. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is important for a strengthening of the discourse and messaging around data literacy in teacher preparation programs to occur. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT This paper presents a higher education experience aimed at explicitly promoting metacognitive processes in a social and collaborative context. Students carried out a debate on an e-forum, and were later asked to collaboratively analyse their own debates. The control group conducted this analysis using text-based tools; the experimental group analysed it with a graphical tool (“DebateGraph”). We examine the consequences of such experiences in promoting students’ metacognitive processes for argumentative competence, as well as its impact on content knowledge learning. The analysis yields different results depending on the perspective adopted: students’ self-assessment or instructor’s assessment. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argumentation, developed either in monological or dialogical forms, is often related to the building of more functional and meaningful knowledge (Venville &amp;amp; Dawson, 2010). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the emergence of the socio-cultural approach (Nussbaum, 2008; Vygotsky, 1978), social and dialogical forms of argumentation have gained importance. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although debates are commonly developed using oral and written language, with the advent of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) new forms of representing arguments are available. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a study developed for higher education aimed at explicitly promoting metacognitive processes in a collaborative context. Teams of students collaboratively analysed their own previously held debates. They did these analyses using two different strategies: the control group had to perform the analysis using textual tools; the experimental group had to analyse it with a graphical tool (“DebateGraph,” (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argumentation and metacognition (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argumentation, conceived as a dialogic form of discussion, can be seen as a social activity that has two goals: first, to support one’s own position by providing evidence and favouring arguments; second, to undermine the opponent’s position by identifying and challenging weaknesses in their argument (Walton, 1998) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metacognition can be defined as the cognition of cognition; it includes at least two main processes: knowledge of cognition and control over cognition (Flavell, 1979). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;argumentation competence requiring three different “metaknowing” components (Rapanta et al., 2013):  Metacognitive knowing: being aware of the appropriate knowledge to support and construct arguments (know-what); metacognitive knowing mainly refers to declarative knowledge (e.g., what concepts can I use to support my stance? What evidence is appropriate to support my argument?).  Metastrategic knowing: knowing suitable strategies, in accordance with the task requirements, to construct arguments (know-how); metastrategic knowing refers to procedural knowledge, and involves understanding and awareness of the task requirements in order to select appropriate strategies (e.g., what procedures can I use to better fulfil the argument task? On what basis can I decide whether an idea is right or wrong?).  Epistemic knowing: being aware of the consequences derived from the cognitive performance in an argumentative task (know-be); this involves knowing about knowledge, both in general and in relation to individuals (e.g., has the argument provoked any knowledge advance in participants? Is argumentation a good setting for solving mathematical problems in teams?). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metacognition has mostly been examined as an individual process, rather than a social or distributed phenomenon among members of a group (Goos, Galbraith, &amp;amp; Renshaw, 2002). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siegel (2012) broke group metacognition down into three components, with the group using these components to reduce the distance between their member’s positions:  Metasocial awareness: the group identifies “who” has “what” expertise and resources;  Monitoring understanding: the group manages to identify what they know on a public level; rendering “holes” in the group’s understanding visible is especially important;  Monitoring process: the group manages to set goals and revise them according to the process they have followed. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group metacognition is under-researched and its effects on teaching and learning are highly underappreciated (Anderson, Nashon, &amp;amp; Thomas, 2009). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;useful for metadiscourse research and SLA research as well (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argumentation and knowledge representation (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these studies compared two conditions (i.e., using graphical representation of arguments versus textual representation), and generally yielded positive outcomes for the graphical condition. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines, other studies have supported the use of visual technological features. Munneke, Andriessen, Kanselaar and Kirschner (2007) confirmed that students argue more thoroughly, both broadening the debate space and examining in greater depth, when they use a tool to represent arguments in a diagrammatic fashion. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research used a case study approach. The case study is an appropriate method for researchers who want to attain a perceptive understanding of an instructional context, by seeking answers to descriptive and explicative questions (Yin, 2003). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifical ly, this study used a quasi-experimental design, with a multi-method approach to the data analysis. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study took place on a Developmental Psychology course in a postgraduate programme (a Master’s degree for Second Language Education Teachers) in a public university in Barcelona, Spain. There were 56 students (43 female, 13 male, M = 25.6 years, SD = 5.9; range = 21-43). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procedure, tasks, and instruments (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we examined three different activities that occurred as part of the same unit: “Development of thinking in adolescence.” The first two activities were developed in collaborative teams of five or six members (n = 10); these teams were organised by the students themselves at the beginning of the course. The third activity was an individual exam. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to assess the virtual debate’s quality, the instructor took into account the quality of the ideas elaborated by the students, the argumentation and support of the ideas, and the accomplishment of the debate instructions. In accordance with those criteria, every debate was evaluated and scored using a three-point scale, where A was excellent, B was good, and C was acceptable/passing. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second activity took place two months after the end of the virtual debate, in a two hour face-to-face session. The aim of the second activity was to analyse the previous debate. Half of the groups (n = 5) were assigned to the experimental condition, where they used the tool DebateGraph. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to present their analysis, all the control groups used the text editor Microsoft Word. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third activity was an individual exam, where the students were presented with an open question that assessed the conceptual knowledge discussed in the debate: “Explain the main features of adolescent thinking.” The answers were graded by the instructor on a 0 to 10 scale poin (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then consider the cognitive consequences of such an experience, analysing whether there are differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of declarative knowledge content learning. To inform this, we consider the instructor’s assessment of the students’ exam answers. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observe significant differences in the appraisal of the learning experience by the students. All the item scores show a statistically significant difference, with the exception of the item “awareness of development of new analytical skills”. T (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the debate’s analysis products, as evaluated by the instructor, did not yield any significant differences. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ANOVA results do not show statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of their exam outcomes. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study yielded some interesting results on how graphical and text-based tools promote the metacognitive skills involved in argumentation. With regard to the accounts of students themselves, gauged by our questionnaire, the students using the graphical tool reported a significantly worse appraisal of metacognitive abilities fostered in their debate analysis. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interesting! And meta &amp;ndash; good to see negative results published by the journal. This increases my respect for this journal and wish to send my work there. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we may state that the students felt that their debate content is better appraised and acknowledged when using text-based tools to analyse it. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know -how metacognition encompasses showing awareness of the debate task and assessing whether the procedures used for constructing arguments are valid or not. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wondering whether the tool introduced unnecessary extranous cognitive load that led to unproductive argumentation. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions In our study, students did not take advantage of using a graphical tool to enhance their learning while analysing their own previous debates. Students in the experimental group neither improved their metacognitive nor their cognitive processes in comparison with the text-based tool group. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a different way to think about the results? Students not taking advantage or not enough support to help them taking advantage? Very interesting questions to raise. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present study reminds us that while the tool (either digital or analogue) may be an important element of the educational activity, many other variables in the educational setting may interact with each other, and eventually play a role in learning processes. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mazza, R., &amp;amp; Botturi, L. (2007). Monitoring an Online Course with the GISMO Tool: A Case Study. Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 18(2), 251–265. Retrieved from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.editlib.org/?fuseaction=Reader.ViewFullText&amp;amp;paper_id=30472#page=100&#34;&gt;http://www.editlib.org/?fuseaction=Reader.ViewFullText&amp;amp;paper_id=30472#page=100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces GISMO, an interesting visual analytics tool integrated into Moodle to support monitoring of learning activities. Activities tracked by GISMO are mostly behavioral (e.g., accessing course materials and posting/reading forum posts). By turning data into a range of (simple) visualizations GISMO could help the instructor (it&amp;rsquo;s only accessible to instructors) monitor students and find areas of the course to be redesigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The tool itself could be broadly categorized as &amp;lsquo;surveillance-oriented analytics&amp;rsquo; for teachers. It is a general purpose tool, as the authors nicely admit, which does not make assumptions about learning.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GISMO provides visualizations of behavioral, cognitive and social data from the course, allowing constant monitoring of students’ activities, engagement and learning outcomes. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems that the students may face when learning online is the lack of support by the instructors and by other peers in the course. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regularly monitoring the students’ activities and being aware of what the students are doing in the course are essential conditions to provide adaptive and effective tutoring. Typical questions that the tutor has to address: “Are students participating in discussions?”, “Have they read the course materials?”, and, “How well do they perform on quizzes?” (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although generic LMS are very effective in facilitating the delivery of distance courses, they provide very little help to instructors to gain understanding of cognitive and social processes in distance classes. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GISMO instead adopts the Information Visualization paradigm (Spence, 2001; Card, Mackinlay, &amp;amp; Shneiderman, 1999), which consists of presenting data in a visual form and relying on the perceptual abilities of human vision for their interpretation. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GISMO – a Graphical Interactive Student Monitoring System (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GISMO implements some of the visualizations found useful by teachers, based on our experience with the CourseVis research, within a new context, namely the Edukalibre project (Botturi et al., 2005) funded by the European Union. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is integrated into the Moodle LMS (Moodle, 2002) and is visible only to the instructors and tutors of courses as an additional block. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, GISMO can be adapted to support other learning platforms, thanks to a software Application Programming Interface (API) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case Study (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section analyzes the case of a completely online course in a master program. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Benefits of GISMO (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To these ends, GISMO has proven to be a powerful tool for at least three activities: (a) monitoring class and individual behavior, (b) assessing participation in discussion forums, and &amp;copy; redesigning the course according to students’ needs. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GISMO is offering a synthetic view of the class behavior in terms of logins, access to resources, and participation in activities. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple matrix formed by students’ names (on Y-axis) and dates of the course (on X-axis) is used to represent the course accesses. Each blue square represents at least one access to the course made by the student on the selected date. The histogram at the bottom shows the global number of hits to the course made by all students on each date. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Instructional Design course, the teaching assistant used the GISMO overview tool every third week in order to monitor the class’ progress in the activities. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use&lt;br /&gt;
 surveillance? (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“slackers” who did a very low number of logins (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the second student logged in frequently during the first two weeks and then abandoned the course. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evaluation of forum participation covers an important position in the Instructional Design course (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GISMO does not provide a complete support to that, but in the case of the Instructional Design course, (a) it allowed identifying at a glance potential “slackers” who did not reach the minimum required number of messages, and (b) it made it easy to retrieve additional data on those cases. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each student of the course, the chart indicates the number of messages posted (with a red square), number of messages read (with a blue circle), and the number of threads started by the student in the discussions (with the green triangle). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GISMO interface allows the teaching staff to identify at once people who post “because you need to” without actually being involved in the discussion and also reading others’ postings. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final critical point in online courses is redesign (Botturi, 2003): What was actually useful to students? What did they actually use? (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GISMO’s visualizations offer a set of synthetic and detailed views about resources (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 9. A graph reporting an overview of students’ accesses to resources of the course (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 10. Details for the accesses to a specific resource of the course (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Issues (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has indicated that the correct interpretation of some data and visualizations require some learning and attention. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is important to understand the actual meaning of data (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, different students have different needs, and the same behavior does not imply the same learning. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RELATED WORK (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, some past works attempt to visualize the communication pattern of a course, identify recurring events and roles, and assess the degree of student engagement in social activities (Reffay &amp;amp; Chanier, 2002; Xiong &amp;amp; Donath, 1999). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces CoruseVis, a visual learning analytics system designed for WebCT. The design of CourseVis draws heavily from Information Visualization principles and (loosely) map with three identified aspects of learning, namely cognitive, social, and behavioral. A large portion of this paper reports on an evaluation study about the effectiveness, efficiency, and usefulness of CourseVis among instructors. This tool was proven to be useful and usable among instructors to have a bird-eye view about their students and effectiveness of their course design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Visualizations in this tool focus on numbers / summary statistics, but less on nuanced aspects of learning (e.g., connecting social interactions with the temporal aspect).)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CourseVis, a system that takes a novel approach of using Web log data generated by course management systems (CMSs) to help instructors become aware of what is happening in distance learning classes. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several graphical representations are generated to help distance learning instructors get a better understanding of social, behavioural, and cognitive aspects related to learners. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith-Gratto, 1999; Hara and Kling, 2000; Rivera and Rice, 2002; Valentine, 2002). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective use of a CMS in distance education requires that instructors have a way to diagnose when a problem might arise or has arisen, so that they can take appropriate actions to prevent or overcome that problem. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of problems with using CMSs in distance learning have been reported, e.g. students may feel isolated due to the limited contact with the instructor and other students, can get disorientated in the course hyperspace, may lose their motivation, and often find it difficult to manage without appropriate institutional support (Galusha, 1997; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, tracking data is usually provided in a tabular format, is often incomprehensible, with a poor logical organization, and is difficult to follow. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioural aspects: specific features of the students’ behaviour, for instance, course attendance, students performing very well or very badly, students who are progressing too fast or too slowly with the course schedule, etc. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational research shows that monitoring the students’ learning is an essential component of high-quality education, and is ‘‘one of the major factors differentiating effective schools and teachers from ineffective ones’’ (Cotton, 1988). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constant feedback and guidance from the instructors is crucial in distance education (Ragan, 1998) where ‘‘the learner is impaired by the lack of casual contact with the teacher and other students’’ (Galusha, 1997). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;true?&lt;br /&gt;
 Wondering whether these claims are still true in the age of social media? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;information visualization (IV) techniques (Tufte, 1990; Card et al., 1999; Spence, 2001) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire included 17 questions, grouped into fourcategories: (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demographic questions addressed the type and duration of involvement in on-line courses, as well as the size and type of the classes. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platform-related questions asked what technological platforms were used and what facilities were provided by these platforms. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student and assessment-related questions asked what assessment techniques where utilized by the instructors, how assessment information was used in their teaching practice, and what information about students the instructors needed. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gathering design requirements for CourseVis (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of CourseVis was based on the results of a survey conducted to find out what information about distance students instructors may need when they run courses with a CMS, and to identify possible ways to help instructors acquire this information. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback-related questions enabling the respondents to enter comments about the survey and to request a summary of the results. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social aspects: interactions between students, interactions between students and the teacher, interactions between students and the system, and vicarious interactions.2 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alert&lt;br /&gt;
 Social data may not be interpreted ‘socially’. A distinction made between socialized vs social learning. Something to keep in mind. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive aspects: the students’ overall course performance, their performance on selected quizzes or assignments, the performance on a specific topic of the course, etc. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Results (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social aspects of learners: The main tools used by the participants to engage students in on-line communicative activities were discussion forums (80%), e-mail (85%), and chat (56%). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive aspects of learners: The most popular assessment tools were quizzes, assignments, and group work, all of them were used between 65% and 76% of the participants. The respondents expressed a high interest in having information about the overall performance in the course (84%), as well as the level of knowledge achieved by each student for each domain concept of the course (60%). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2 Design space for the discussion plot generated in CourseVis (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioural aspects of learners: Instructors use behavioural indicators to judge factors such as active learning, motivation, engagement, and, in general, to assess the success or failure of a distance course. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;time (T), retinal properties of colour ðCÞ, size (SZ), orientation ðOÞ, and shape (SH), and connection (–).4 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. Visualizing social aspects of learners (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Design requirements for CourseVis The results of the survey led to key information requirements for Course Vis, shown in Table 1. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One representation produced in CourseVis to represent social aspects is a discussion plot in which the discussion board variables (originator, date, topic) are mapped onto the three dimensions of a 3D scatterplot. An additional dimension—the number of follow-ups in a discussion—is represented by the size of the sphere, as well as by using colour, see Table 2. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CourseVis (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructor may perform operations, such as rotating and zooming, to manipulate the image. Figs. 1 and 2 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To define the design spaces of the graphical representations in CourseVIS we have followed a conventional method described in Card and Mackinlay (1997). CMS tracking data variables have been mapped to the following visual signals: space coordinates ðX ; Y ; ZÞ, a coordinate for (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example representation generated in CourseVis to visualize social aspects is a discussion graph, which is a trivariate representation describing the number of threads started and the number of follow-ups received for each thread. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. Visualizing cognitive aspects of learners (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students’ results from quizzes were identified in the design requirements as the main source used to assess the students’ understanding of the domain. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domain can be seen as a collection of concepts fC1; &amp;hellip; ; Cng where each concept Ci is composed of a list of pages fPi1 ; &amp;hellip; ; Pih g belonging to the content material of the course and a set of questions fQi1 ; &amp;hellip; ; Qik g selected among the quizzes in the course (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple approach allows CourseVis to link marks received on questions with concepts of the domain. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cognitive matrix, the students are mapped onto the x-axis and the concepts are mapped onto the y-axis of a matrix. The performance values are mapped onto the colour of the mark corresponding to a student and a concept, which is represented by a square. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The matrix enables global analysis of the overall student performance on the course topics and comparison between topics and individual students. This can promote the instructors’ reflection on their practice. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cognitive aspects of learners, CourseVis generates two representations—a cognitive matrix (see Fig. 4) and a cognitive graph (see Fig. 5). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3. Visualizing behavioural aspects of students (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time a student accesses the course, CMSs register the date, time and the duration. We take advantage of this information to create the student accesses plot which summarizes the overall students’ attendance in the course. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global accesses of all students on day D is calculated as the sum of the number of accesses of every student on that day. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of variables related to the students’ performance on a concept and their mappings are given in Table 5. This bivariate data can be represented with a cognitive graph relating the two variables, as shown in Fig. 5. Course concepts are mapped onto the x-axis and the performance mean is mapped onto the y-axis. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the graph allows a quicker and more precise evaluation of problematic concepts. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other behavioural aspects are covered in a student behaviour graph. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accesses to content pages by topics (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global accesses to the course: (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation with instructors (p. 8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An empirical evaluation of CourseVis was conducted focusing on: Effectiveness: Can the tool help instructors gain some understanding of what is happening in distance classes? Efficiency: Can instructors infer required information quickly? Usefulness: To what extent is information provided useful for the instructors? (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a focus group, an experimental study, and a semistructured interview. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1. Focus group (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messages (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quiz and assignment submission (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See Mazza (2004) for a detailed description of CourseVis and more examples of graphical representations. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predominant criticisms of the discussion plot (see Figs. 1 and 2) was the difficulty in locating the exact position of the spheres onto the axis. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the rotation of the scatterplot was considered confusing (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were very positive about the discussion graph (see Fig. 3) due to its clarity and simplicity. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants commented that the cognitive matrix (see Fig. 4) could be used to monitor anomalous situations (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants stressed that the cognitive graph (see Fig. 5) may help instructors to quantify the difference between concepts, but that the cognitive matrix was preferred, because it allowed ‘‘a quicker glance’’ to compare concepts and individual students’ performance at the same time. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants would use the student accesses plot (see Fig. 6) to monitor the students’ accesses and identify early problems. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were asked to pretend that they were the instructors of the course and to get as much information as possible about the students. Both groups where provided with instructor access to the course. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the participants found the student behavior graph (see Fig. 7) confusing and difficult to follow. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the access to content pages by topics and the global access to the course were regarded as very useful. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social aspects: Five of the six participants found it interesting to have the information on the number of threads opened and the follow-up received. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the discussion graph was preferred for its clarity and simplicity, while the discussion plot was judged helpful for the relationship of discussions with the dates. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive aspects: All participants considered the information provided by the graphical representations on cognitive aspects useful. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioural aspects. The student accesses plot was considered useful by most participants (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was stressed that this representation did not express the real engagement of a student in the course, for example, a student may print all the course materials and study on his own without accessing the course for several days. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.4. Discussion (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;variables at the same time. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvements have been suggested, such as providing flexible links between the graphical representations, developing easy connections between graphics and corresponding data from CMS (e.g. a link from a discussion graph to postings in the discussion forum), and enabling instructors to say what data should be included/excluded from graphics and what elements should be highlighted (e.g. important dates). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CourseVis would also be greatly improved by providing direct access from the visualizations to the details that make up a particular aspect of a plot, e.g. opening a discussion thread, bringing up all the assignments related to arrays, etc. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.4.5. Problems with the graphical representations and limitations of the evaluation studies (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Related work (p. 12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems were related to missing values, confusions with rotation, and difficulty in examining too many (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Raffay and Chanier (2002) utilize the Graphvis (2004) visualization tool monitoring group communications in order to help instructors detect collaboration problems. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is much more dicult to assess productive vocabulary knowledge than it is to assess receptive vocabulary knowledge. The main reason for this is that the vocabulary produced by a learner, whether in written or spoken form, tends to be so context-speci®c that it is dicult to calculate from any small sample the true size or range of the learner&amp;rsquo;s productive vocabulary. It is also dicult to devise simple tasks which produce the large quantities of vocabulary that are necessary to make reasonable estimates. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are problems inherent in these two types of test. The controlled productive vocabulary tests are eective mainly at low levels; when, for example, testees are expected to have a limited vocabulary size, then a high proportion of these words can be tested. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One super®cially attractive alternative to continuous text as a source of productive vocabulary is the spew test (Palmberg, 1987; Waring, 1999). In spew tests, subjects are simply asked to produce words which share a common feature, e.g. words beginning with B. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lex30 task is basically a word association task, in which testees are presented with a list of stimulus words, and required to produce responses to these stimuli. There is no predetermined set of response target words for the subject to produce, and in this way, Lex30 resembles a free productive task. However, the stimulus words tend to impose some constraints on the responses, and Lex30 thus shares some of the advantages of context-limited productive tests. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results reported above suggest that Lex30 might be modestly successful in this regard. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Lex30 scores relate closely to scores on a test of passive recognition vocabulary suggests that Lex30 is sensitive to gross dierences in vocabulary knowledge. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main practical advantage of Lex30 is that it is extremely easy to administer, and requires very little time to complete. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article introduces a novel way to assess productive vocabulary &amp;ndash; P-LeX &amp;ndash; which is better at handling shorter text (in comparison with LFP) and easier to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT This paper describes an alternative approach to assessing the lexical complexity of short texts produced by second language learners of English. This methodology bears a passing resemblance to the Lexical Frequency Profile (LFP) suggested by Laufer and Nation (1995), but the approach it takes is mathematically more sophisticated, and the data it produces is easier to work with. We argue that P_Lex produces data which is broadly comparable with the data produced by LFP. However, P_Lex works much better with shorter texts than LFP does, and this makes it a better tool for evaluating texts produced by low-level learners. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common approach to this problem has been to work with measures of lexical richness, or lexical diversity. Indices of this sort have been widely used in studies of lexico-statistics (eg Herdan 1960) and L1 development (eg Miller and Klee 1995), and they have begun to appear with increasing frequency in work on L2 speakers (eg Arnaud 1984, Broeder et al 1988, Malvern and Richards 1997). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this work uses measures that compare the number (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of Lexical Types in a text with the number of Lexical Tokens in the same text. A number of measures of this sort exist (see Table 1), but there is no clear agreement about which is the best variant to use in the context of L2 learners. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main practical difficulty with measures based on Types and Tokens is that they are sensitive to the length of the text being assessed (longer texts typically have lower Type/Token Ratios than shorter ones do) (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures listed in Table 1 are all examples of what we might call Intrinsic Measures of Lexical Variety. In these measures, variety is assessed solely in terms of the words that appear in the text itself. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that there might be a case for developing some Extrinsic Measures of Lexical Richness for use with L2 learners. These measures would not be limited to the number of Types or Tokens appearing in an L2 text: they would supplement this information with additional information about the sorts of words being used, and the sorts of lexical choices that are being made in a particular text. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a measure of this sort is to be found in Laufer and Nation’s Lexical Frequency Profile (Laufer and Nation 1995). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our experience, LFP has poor measurement characteristics and does not discriminate well between texts, because it relies very heavily on a simple count of the number of Category Three and Category Four words in the text. The number of these words in a ‘typical’ text is usually very small, and this severely limits the way LFP works. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, a serious practical problem with LFP is that it requires relatively long texts for stable measures to emerge. Laufer and Nation claim that in their data ‘profiles over 200 words were found to be stable, while those done on less than 200 words were not’ (1995: 314). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P_Lex (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P_Lex is based on the idea that it might be possible to make a virtue out of the fact that ‘difficult’ words occur only infrequently in texts. P_Lex looks at the distribution of difficult words in a text, and returns a simple index that tells us how likely the occurrence of these words is. The underlying assumption here is that people with big vocabularies are more likely to use infrequent words than people with smaller vocabularies are, and that we can use the index we derive from the texts as a pointer to vocabulary size. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, it turns out that the distributions we get for this type of analysis are strongly skewed to the left: most texts contain few difficult words, and texts that contain a very high proportion of such words are themselves quite unusual. Distributions that are strongly skewed to the left are often (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poisson distributions (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mathematics of fitting curves to data is fairly complex, so we have summarised this process in detail in Appendix A. For readers who don’t want to get that involved, it is enough to know that there is a procedure which makes it possible to turn data like that in Table 3 into a single figure, conventionally known as lambda. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lambda values typically range from 0 to about 4.5, with higher figures corresponding to a higher proportion of infrequent words. Lambda values have good measurement characteristics, and this allows them to be added and averaged straightforwardly. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, however, lambda scores are much less sensitive to text length than the LFP scores are, and, critically, the P_Lex methodology gives lambda scores that are reasonably stable with very short texts. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An evaluation of P_Lex This section illustrates the way P_Lex works with a large set of texts produced by L2 learners of English. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our basic question was whether the P_Lex methodology is reliably stable across administrations (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also examined whether the P_Lex measure was able to distinguish reliably between groups of learners at different levels of proficiency. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is clear from Figure 2 that P_Lex is essentially stable from about 120 words, and that texts of this length clearly discriminate between the proficiency levels (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;illustrated. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data in this figure suggest that it might be possible to get reliable P_Lex data from texts that were considerably shorter than the texts analysed in the main experiment. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data reported above suggest that the P_Lex methodology is basically a reliable one, which produces data very similar to the data produced by LFP. However, P_Lex has the advantage that it seems to work with much shorter texts than the recommended minimum test length for LFP, and this makes it a more useful tool for analysing the output of L2 learners, particularly lowerlevel learners. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of validity is much more awkward to deal with. There are two basic problems here. The first problem is that there are no other tests of productive vocabulary with which we can compare these data. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach here has been to use the so-called Productive Version of the Levels Test as a comparison point, but there are a number of reasons for viewing the Levels Test as a poor instrument (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem concerns our selection of ‘difficult’ words. In the work reported here, we have defined ‘difficult’ in terms of frequency, a practice that is largely unquestioned in this field. The version of P_Lex used here used Nation’s (1984) word lists as a way of discriminating between ‘easy’ words and ‘hard’ words. We arbitrarily assigned words in Nation’s 1000 word list to the former category, along with proper nouns, numerals and geographical derivatives, while any other words were assigned to the latter category. We think, however, that there might be a case for exploring alternative ways of characterising vocabulary. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we think that ‘difficult’ vocabulary is not entirely to be defined in terms of frequency: words are unusual in particular contexts for particular groups of L1 speakers, and it may not be possible to draw up a list of ‘difficult’ (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ‘difficult’ words would then actually indicate a lack of appropriate vocabulary. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix A: How the lambda scores are calculated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of fitting Poisson curves to our data is that these curves are conveniently described by a compact formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PN =(λN *e-λ )/N!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical value in this formula is the variable λ (lambda), which defines the overall shape of the curve. If we know the value of lambda, then we know what the curve will look like, and this means that we can use lambda as a short- hand for describing data like the sample presented in Table 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, these curves are not exact fits, and P_Lex reports an Error Figure, which shows how well the data are described by the best-fitting Poisson curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most design disciplines there is usually a clear division of labour between designers, developers and evaluators. An architect designs a building, which a contractor builds. An inspector verifies that it meets all the required standards. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Schön’s view, this is the antidote for what he calls the dilemma of abandonment: practitioners may feel, in relation to the academy, a sense of having been seduced and abandoned. [&amp;hellip;] an erosion of practitioners’ faith in the ability of academic research to deliver knowledge usable for solving social problems. [&amp;hellip;] On the other hand, when practitioners accept and try to use the academy’s esoteric knowledge they are apt to discover that its appropriation alienates then from their own understandings, engendering a loss of their sense of competence and control. He concludes that “nowhere are these dilemmas more apparent than in the field of education” (Schön, 1992b, p. 120). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher inquiry, which emerged in the late 1980s (Cochran-Smith &amp;amp; Lytle, 1999), can be seen both as a way to improve day-to-day teaching in the classroom and as professional development for teachers. Clarke and Erickson (2003) define teacher inquiry as a set of research practices by which teachers examine their practice and its effects on students’ learning, in order to enhance their professional knowledge and improve their practice (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their extensive survey of the literature, Clark et al identified that: key characteristics that may contribute to a broadly conceptualised definition of teacher inquiry include the notion that it is: systematic, intentional, contextual, self-critical, practical, action oriented, planned, evidence-based, evaluative, and shared, and the main challenge lies in transforming teachers’ personal skills, knowledge, and expertise into professional skills, knowledge and expertise. (Clark, Luckin &amp;amp; Jewitt, 2011, p. 8) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this a step further, teacher inquiry into student learning (TISL) focuses on the evidence base of student learning data that is available in technology-rich environments and its role in improving practice. TISL is a systematic, intentional, design-oriented approach to teachers’ technology-supported inquiry into students’ learning. It focuses on the development and use of formative e-assessment methods using advanced learning technologies (digital tools) to capture, analyse, interpret, share and evaluate student data. In so doing, it aims to contribute to the development of teacher professionalism and school improve- ment through a focus on teacher-centred, practice-based, evidence-oriented research activity. (Clark et al, 2011, p. 13) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data-informed approach to teacher inquiry, a key quality of TISL, is part of a wider trend in education, towards the use of data and analytics to inform educational practice. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dietz-Uhler and Hurn (2013) review eight institutions that have incorporated learning analytics into their teaching and learning systems and list a variety of uses they observed. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A current problem is that the information provided by learning analytics tools is not generally aligned with teachers’ needs for the management of learning activities. We need to be aware that the pedagogical decisions embedded in learning designs affect both the learning analytics process and its outcomes. We also need to take into account that mixed approaches will be necessary to represent and understand the complex dynamics of groups of students in online learning envi- ronments. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, most of the work in the field of learning design has focused on the creative processe (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very little has been done in terms of the practices, tools and representations used for evaluating the effects of the designs. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several approaches emphasise top-down quality enhancement, which help designers to base their work on sound pedagogical principles. What is missing is the trajectory that would complete the feedback loop: the built-in evaluation of designs to see whether they achieved the expected outcomes. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TISL also stands to benefit from a dialogue with learning design. Inquiry, as proposed by Dewey, is a learning process modelled on the practices of scientific work. Teachers frame conjectures, identify the suitable methods for testing these conjectures, conduct empirical work to implement these test, and share and reflect on the outcomes. Indeed, teacher inquiry has also been referred to as teacher research or classroom action research.Yet, when we say “scientific work,” what do we mean?The dominant interpretation in this context would be based on the paradigms of social sciences. By contrast, Laurillard (2013) and Mor and Winters (2007) propose Simon’s notion of design science as a valuable alternative (Simon, 1996). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining learning design andTISL can thus give birth to a “citizen design science of learning.” What this combination still lacks is its scientific instruments: how can we actually measure the effects of a design? Learning analytics offer an answer to this question. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The field of learning analytics faces considerable challenges, some of which could be addressed by a closer dialogue with learning design and TISL. Some of these are technical, some political, cultural or administrative, some ethical (Dietz-Uhler &amp;amp; Hurn, 2013; Ferguson, 2012). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The linking of learning design and teacher inquiry is aligned both with Schön’s conception of design as inquiry and with Simon’s model of design science. Learning analytics provide the instrument for making this design inquiry of learning truly powerful. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emin-Martínez et al (2014) take a first step towards this integration and propose a teacher-led design inquiry of learning as a new model of educational practice and professional development. The model is designed to capture the essence of the synergy of learning design,TISL and learning analytics. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing analytics with students enhances their opportunities for self- assessment, whereas opening up design for learning provides a way to share the quality principles that govern education. This can have positive impact on understanding, negotiating and inno- vating for educational quality. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This article argues for use of statistical modeling, esp. ERGM, in network analysis. It offers some useful analysis of the gap (~15 yrs ago) and proposes approaches to mitigating the gaps. Some important points include &amp;lsquo;model closes the gap between theory and data&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;traditional network analysis focuses on descriptives, for no apparent reasons&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: This article is helpful for my thinking on modeling collaboration in a network manner. The connection between theory and data with model, and the connection between simple, local rules and larger network patterns are especially interesting and relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network theory has traditionally sought to use social relations to bridge what social scientists refer to as the micro-macro gap: understanding how social structures are formed by the accumulation of simple rules operating on local relations. (p. 187)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly promising approach is based on exponential random graph models (ERGM). ERGM were first applied in the context of spatial statistics, and they provide a general framework for modeling dependent data where the dependence can be thought of as a neighborhood effect. The models can be used to decompose overall network structural properties into the effects of localized interaction rules; the traditional concern of the field. An example is given using an HIV transmission network. (p. 187)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;underlying process that gives rise to the patterns of links among nodes in the population – this requires us to think about a dynamic model that links local processes to a global outcome. The second is the inverse question: how to infer the underlying process from the patterns we observe – this requires statistical methods for sampling, estimation and inference. (p. 187)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some simple local rules may lead to overall network structures that display striking regularities, like linear hierarchies, stable cliques, or stable cycles of exchange. (p. 188)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idea&lt;br /&gt;
 one idea is to model the change of a simple rule (e.g., read 2 notes before posting 1) can have an impact on social networks in collaboration. (p. 188)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, however, the methodology that did develop in the field of network analysis focused on static descriptive measures, rather than the dynamic model. (p. 188)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descriptive approach (p. 188)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;have become the heart of the field, providing a rich framework for thinking about networks and a wide range of summary measures to represent both the network position occupied by specific nodes, and the overall network structure (p. 188)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model-based methods rely on the assumption of independent observations to obtain tractable likelihood-based estimation and inference. (p. 188)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical Models for Networks (p. 189)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is general agreement that the exponential family of distributions provides a good framework for modeling the probability that a random graph (or sociomatrix) X takes the observed value x. (p. 189)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the statistical theory for ERGM was developed and applied in the context of spatial statistics by Besag (1974). The simplest spatial models represent observations as points on a lattice, and assume that only the nearest neighbors have an influence on the status of a site. (p. 189)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While physical space may influence the pattern of ties, it is not the only factor. As a result, the notion of “space” in network models is largely endogeneous and neighborhoods are typically not defined in terms of proximity in the matrix. (p. 190)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the nature of the “spatial” dependence is the primary focus of interest in network analysis, the parameters that define this dependence are not nuisance parameters, but the parameters of most interest. (p. 190)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first application of ERGM like models to networks was Holland and Leinhardt’s p1 model for directed graphs. (p. 191)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the network statistics that drive the model are simple functions of links, and the neighborhood represented by the statistics is easy to read from functional forms. (p. 191)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, one can also catch a glimpse of the two key mechanisms for reducing the number of parameters in these models: one is to limit the number of configurations represented as having an effect on the probability of the graph, the other is to impose “homogeneity constraints” on isomorphic configurations. (p. 191)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next extension of ERGM in networks took on the task of modeling dyadic dependence. The ability to model dyadic dependence is the single most important feature of the ERGM framework, both because it is theoretically appealing, and because it is statistically innovative. (p. 192)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the enormous flexibility the ERG framework has brought to the field, virtually all of the published applications of these models have either used a variant of the original p1 model, or the simplified Markov graph. This is somewhat curious, as both are pretty mechanical renderings of what one might think of as the “neighborhood” of influence, and neither is particularly well suited to representing the kinds of processes traditionally of interest to network modelers. (p. 193)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of model development is probably due to the extremely challenging technical problems that accompany the estimation of these models.3 Another problem is the lack of data, or at least of the type of data currently required. (p. 193)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it may also be that our ability to think, empirically, in terms of positions and network structure has atrophied as we have waited for the right tools to become available. Whatever the reason, there has been remarkably little application of these modeling tools to data. (p. 193)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note&lt;br /&gt;
 good point to make. (p. 193)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Models are the bridge between theory and data. (p. 193)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this paper, I will show how these models can be used to formalize the investigation of how a global network structure might cumulate up from simple local rules in a specific case. (p. 193)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From local rules to global structures: Partnership networks and the spread of HIV (p. 194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some reason to think that such local rules may govern the network structures of interest. (p. 194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixing refers to assortative and disassortative biases in the joint distribution of partners’ attributes. Examples include the degree of matching on race, age, sex, social status, sexual orientation or level of sexual activity. Assortative biases can create patchy, clustered networks, which tends to increase the speed of spread within groups, and slow the spread between them. (p. 194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linking network data to network simulation requires a statistical bridge: a modeling framework that enables the key structural parameters to be estimated from network data, so that these can be used to directly drive a simulation. ERGMs have the potential to do this. (p. 195)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Model-Based Hypothesis (p. 196)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now in a position to test a different kind of hypothesis about the role of networks on disease spread. (p. 196)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, we choose partners because they are the right sex, age, race and status, and we often care if they have other partners. (p. 196)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If simple local rules govern partner selection, then these also determine the aggregate structure in the network: what looks like an unfathomably complicated system is, in fact, produced by a few key local organizing principles. (p. 196)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idea&lt;br /&gt;
 interesting — simple local rules that govern + actionable insights to make changes.&lt;br /&gt;
 This example is about public health. We can apply to the health of discourse as well. (p. 196)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both mixing and concurrency are network properties that can be measured with local network sampling strategies. If it turns out that these two local rules explain most of the variation (p. 196)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in network structure that is relevant to disease spread, then we have a simple inexpensive way to measure network vulnerability routinely in public health surveillance. And they describe simple behavioral rules that people can be taught to recognize and change. (p. 197)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the last piece of the puzzle is to determine how to test the hypothesis that mixing and concurrency contain all of the information we need to know to evaluate the spread potential in a network. We seek a “goodness of fit” test, but one that is tailored to what we want to fit. (p. 197)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmission potential in a network is determined by the network connectivity. Connectivity can be measured in a number of ways, but two simple measures are the properties of reachability (is person i connected to person j by a path of some length?) and distance (what is the length of that path?). (p. 197)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also use the MCMC simulation engine to verify whether these features are sufficient for establishing the epidemic potential in a network. (p. 197)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We argue that, just like musical pieces, TEL environments need to be created (i.e., orchestrated), adapted (i.e., arranged) and reified (i.e., conducted), and educational research that attempts to make a practical impact needs to consider all three processes. (p. 507)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We argue that it is the narrow perspective that Dillenbourg advocates concerning what orchestration is (namely the real-time management of events and activities in a classroom) that ignites such criticism. (p. 507)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orchestration precedes arrangement, and arrangement precedes conducting – how does this translate to taking TEL environments into the classroom? (p. 507)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are TEL scenarios developed and how do they find their way into classrooms? First, a curriculum developer (e.g., a researcher) develops a scenario and provides a description of how different resources and tools should be combined and used by the teacher and the students. Second, a teacher takes the description and adapts it to the constraints of her classroom (e.g., she may skip a step of the description because her classroom does not provide the necessary technical resources). Third, the TEL scenario is enacted in the classroom under the guidance of the teacher. (p. 508)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is however more interesting for our purposes is a description of the activities of the creator (composer vs. TEL scenario developer) and the enactor (conductor vs. teacher) in the two cases: When composing a symphony, the first step (creating and writing up the score) is usually called orchestrating. The second step (adapting the score to the characteristics of the orchestra) is called arranging. And what the conductor does during practice (step 3) and performance (step 4) is conducting. Thus, when Dillenbourg (2013) equates orchestration with the real-time management of activities and events in the classroom, he actually talks about “conducting”, not “orchestration”. (p. 508)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we argue for an expansion of the definition of “orchestration” in the context of TEL: “Orchestrating TEL means the process of creating, adapting and enacting a technology-enhanced learning scenario under complex classroom conditions1”. (p. 508)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classroom scripts as scores for TEL (p. 508)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our own research (e.g., Kollar, Wecker, Langer, &amp;amp; Fischer, 2011), we have used the term “classroom scripts” to refer to such specifications of the flow of learning activities over the different social planes of a classroom (note their closeness to what a “score” is for an orchestra!). (p. 508)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing a “score” that defines what activities are supposed to happen on which social plane at what point in time is thus an important requirement of a successful orchestration of TEL scenarios. However, when we view orchestration as including processes of developing, arranging and conducting, our approach can be criticized for only focussing on the first process. In deed, it was us (the researchers) who developed a plan for the curriculum unit, but we did not allow the teacher to adapt the score, nor did we allow for freedom during its enactment (we made sure that teachers could not change the order or levels of activities). (p. 509)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methodological implications of using the expanded orchestration metaphor (p. 509)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orchestras consist of individuals who may be grouped into sub-groups (horns section, winds section etc.) that together form a larger group – just like classrooms. In research on orchestrating TEL, we should thus admit that we are investigating multilevel phenomena and apply new methods to appropriately address these multilevel phenomena. (p. 509)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Academy of Engineering. (2015). Educate to Innovate: Factors That Influence Innovation: Based on Input from Innovators and Stakeholders. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book on &amp;lsquo;education for innovation&amp;rsquo; is a fun read. Ideas presented in the book are mostly based on interviews and workshops with &amp;lsquo;innovators&amp;rsquo; and resonated with me. Chapter 4, which presents a framework that explains how skills experiences and environments relate to innovation, is of particular interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new educational paradigm is needed to help current and future American workers remain competitive. Corporate and national educational strategies should create opportunities for students and workers to develop their ability to innovate. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the Educate to Innovate project is to expand and improve the innovative capacity of individuals and organizations by identifying critical skills, attributes, and best practices—indeed, cultures—for nurturing them. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation is widely heralded as the key to successful competition in the increasingly global economy. How is the United States preparing its students and workers to innovate and excel in the new economy? What skills and attributes need to be nurtured? Is it even possible to educate to innovate? (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Is Innovation? (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was general agreement on a first-order distinction between innovation and entrepreneurship: Innovation creates societal value (through an existing or new product, process, or service), and entrepreneurship involves realizing the market value of an opportunity, not necessarily an innovation, by making it commercially or socially viable. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGURE 4-1 Factors that contribute to the success of innovators. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ough they are examined individually, skills were often discussed as part of a obtain those skills. Accordingly, a new framework for factors that influence the success collection of factors that contribute to successful innovation, each of which may fuel or depend on of innovators has been developed (Figure 4-1). It captures the interplay between skills, another. Some of these characteristics may be perceived as innate, but many participants felt that they can experiences, and environments as fundamental to the success of innovators. In general, be nurtured by educational programs. environments provide experiences and these experiences enhance or develop the skills of the innovators. When asked to think abo (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;participants similarly noted the application necessity of creativity for invention, innovation, the interviewed innovators cited and entrepreneurship. According to Ryan Bailey, “I think you can be creative without being innovative, but it would be hard to • creativity, be innovative without being creative.” KT Moortgat (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;intense curiosity, • the ability to identify serendipitous moments, • willingness to take risks and to fail, • passion, • knowledge of their field, • the ability to identify good problems/ideas, • the ability to work at the interfaces of disciplines, and • the ability to sell an idea. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dissatisfaction with the Status Quo (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Hornik contends that innovators get frustrated when they encounter problems and constantly think about how to improve everything they encounter in their daily lives and “the fact that people are not making it better, and so they see lots and lots of opportunities to make the world a better place, and they envision ways in which to do it.” (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intense Curiosity (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are curious tend to be observant of new ideas, concepts, or situations and associate them with something else they’ve learned and take advantage of serendipitous situations. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ability to Identify Serendipitous Moments (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others felt that the US education system does not prepare its students to look for or take advantage of such moments. One reason for this, according to Tim Cook, is that education is “largely too formal, too predictable, too planned, too regimented, too routine.” Franz Aliquo extended this characterization to life in general: “Life is really built to make you ignore those serendipitous moments &amp;hellip; to stick with a predetermined path instead of noticing these weird things that are happening on the periphery&amp;hellip; . I learned to overcome it the hard way by noticing the various streams of life and having to select those that were most appropriate for me.” (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk Taking (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a big difference between encouraging failure and discouraging fear of failure. The really big wins, from an innovation perspective, are often risky and uncertain. You can’t tell if you’re going to succeed or fail when you start. You have to build and be unafraid of failing on the other side. You don’t have to like failure, but in order to get the big win, you cannot fear it. – Regina Dugan (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Walshe talked about the importance of distinguishing between perceived risk and actual risk: “We need to differentiate the perceived level of risk versus actual risk. If the perceived risk is much higher than the actual risk, it provides for good training opportunities as long as the difference is not so great that it causes the person to ‘freeze’ or lose the ability to learn from the situation. If the perception of risk is low but the actual risk is high, then the results can be catastrophic. In our business this is when people get hurt or killed. High performers are ‘masters of risk.’” (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the innovators cautioned against blind acceptance of failure, which could lead to experimenting for the sake of experimenting. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passion (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Walshe said that having passion for one’s pursuit buffers the emotional impact of failure and helps an innovator persevere in the face of failure (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Field-Specific Knowledge (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Heeger added that the depth of the knowledge should be such that “you get to a point where you have almost an intuition about what is right and what is wrong. If something is not right, you can smell it. After you have that core of knowledge and experience then you can branch out and learn other techniques, learn other experiments.” (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond in-depth knowledge in their field, innovators must know their capabilities and limitations. In the absence of such self-awareness, the innovator risks not being able to choose the most promising directions. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing what not to do is unbelievably important, but by its nature is overlooked as a skill set. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ability to Identify Good Problems/Ideas (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees cited the importance of the ability to identify a good problem. But they acknowledged that identifying a good problem is not a straightforward process. In the words of David Morse, “There is an art to innovation—knowing how to recog- (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nize things that have a chance of becoming a commercial success and what it takes to achieve that (practical) success.” Robert Langer concurred: “I’m not sure that there’s a single answer to that [how to identify good problems/ideas], and I don’t know that there’s a simple way to say that a certain idea is absolutely a good idea. It’s kind of like beauty—a good idea is just like ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder.’” (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;interviewees provided important guidelines for doing so: • Spend a considerable amount of time coming up with, thinking about, and defining the problem. • Follow your instinct/intuition. • Choose problems based on their impact on humanity and identify where there is a need. • Identify actionable problems—those that are practical and have solutions that can be executed. • Target areas where there is less activity. • Gather input from those the innovation is meant to help. • Investigate failure and ask yourself, “Is there a path that will lead to success?” • Identify interesting problems, ones that you feel passionate about. • Know when to quit or change direction. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovators are people who are real misfits in their field, because they can see across borders, they can see across borders of discipline, geography, all of that. They’re the ones who can make those disparate connections between, say, DNA and a hard drive, and say “Let me make a DNA hard drive.” – NinaTandon (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alyssa Panitch said that she is most innovative when she is on the fringes of what she knows and what she does not know well, and that she is less constrained by the “dogma of the disciplines” when she is operating in this space. She calls herself a “jack of all trades” and said, “I always argue that I know just enough chemistry and know just enough biology to be dangerous, and I think that that’s true.” (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more interesting intersections, in my experience, are those that are unexpected. – Frans Johansson (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to communicate one’s ideas in a clear and inspiring way is increasingly important in the growing global information economy, and is crucial for innovators, who are often engaged in team activity. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Metcalfe agreed that, in contrast to the process of inventing, innovation “involves more people, involves selling your ideas, and the kind of selling that is mostly listening!” (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Workshop: Additional Skills and Attributes (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ability to handle uncertainty (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;persistence. Also cast as “grit,” “street smarts,” “bull-headedness,” and “dogged determination,” (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexibility was mentioned as a necessary complement to persistence—the ability and willingness to change course during a problem-solving process. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXPERIENCES (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• interdisciplinary collaborations, • industrial experience, • identification and solution of open problems, • mentorship, • role models, and • upbringing that nurtures innovation. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENVIRONMENTS (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1916 John Dewey wrote, “We never educate directly, but indirectly by means of the environment. Whether we permit chance environments to do the work, or whether we design environments for the purpose, makes a great difference.”1 (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees and workshop participants observed that although children enter school full of curiosity, creativity, and other promising skills, the educational environments seem not to encourage but actually discourage the development and enhancement of skills. Academic institutions should design an environment that provides experiences to the students to develop or enhance skills needed to become successful innovators. Guidance, independence, accessibility, flexibility, encouragement, socialization—these are elements of an environment that help students to be innovative. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The innovators’ thoughts and recollections about environment yielded the most detailed understanding of the types and characteristics of this influence on their lives. Environments that encourage innovation should • explicitly encourage innovation, • have physical spaces for free/open/informal discussions, • facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, • encourage following one’s passion, • place a strong emphasis on the value of education, and • provide freedom to tinker. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant from the large business sector explained that newer measures of success in innovation are yielded by questions such as, “Did you get to a decision point in your project team?” “Did you collectively achieve what you set out to do?” “How did you bring everybody together for innovation?” In other words, there is emphasis on the group, not the individual innovator. (p. 54)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by identifying what kids really care about. (p. 54)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further research: Some natural attributes cannot be taught so it may be more useful to think about how to avoid destroying them. Research to identify what prevents innovation would be helpful. (p. 55)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent culture has taught students that failure is not acceptable/expected. An “everyone wins” approach leads students to think success is quick and easy. Create the right messages so that students have realistic views about innovation: — Innovation is difficult. — Innovation requires patience. — Failure is a natural part of the journey toward success. — Success has many definitions. Suggestion: Schools could create a more realistic environment in which students can experience small failures and learn how to be resilient through experience and debriefing. This isn’t about encouraging failure but supporting the idea that it is acceptable to fail and recover. Success in innovation is more about give and take, limitations and challenge and less about straight risk and failure or success. “Do, Fail, Learn.” (p. 56)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work toward a culture shift in academia, because it seems that educating to innovate is at odds with the way many universities operate currently. Academia should reevaluate the reasons for teaching traditional and heavily structured knowledge, which may conflict with the expectations of today’s employers. (p. 58)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weave innovation-related knowledge and experiences (e.g., risk taking and management, failure, real-world problems, mentors) into existing courses, because it is difficult to start new courses and programs from scratch, and because innovation should be pervasive in the academic environment. (p. 59)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K–12 Education (p. 62)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangible shortand long-term measures of success should be considered, and should take account of both group and individual performance. For example, did the group collectively achieve what it set out to do? Was a decision point reached within a project team? It may also be helpful to compare school/program graduates with a baseline cohort. (p. 62)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of elements to be considered for innovation education, the group stressed learning by doing and getting students to be comfortable with the idea of not finding immediate answers. Students must be given the freedom to generate creative ideas even if there is no short-term return or fruition. Educators, in turn, need to understand how to give students more time to innovate, balancing between providing freedom and using deadlines. (p. 63)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Provide more opportunities for learning by doing and balance the teaching of foundations with freedom (e.g., more time to innovate) and deadlines. Encourage creative ideas even if there is no short-term return or fruition of the idea. Make people comfortable with not finding immediate answers. (p. 63)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilitator asked, “What needs to happen in K–12 in order to educate to innovate?” • Combine innovation with the teaching of basic science through projects or open-ended labs. • Create interdisciplinary teams to complement each other, e.g., integrating the arts with STEM subjects. • Create strategic partnerships—for example, between small business development centers, Chambers of Commerce, universities, businesses, and economic development organizations—to develop pipelines for students to work on ideas. • Create a pedagogy, class, framework, or method where students learn from their mistakes without being penalized. Make failure a learning experience. • Improve preservice education for teachers. • Create job-embedded professional development to support stronger cultures of professional growth. • Reimagine the curriculum based on the goals we want to get out of it. • Question or challenge the notion that education needs to be standardized. • Introduce students to the creative process. Create spaces for tinkering and connections among people with different talents so there is cross-fertilization among tinkering projects. Google’s 20 percent time was cited as an example, as well as Invent to Learn: Making, Tinkering, and Engineering in the Classroom (Sylvia Libow Martinez and Gary Stager, 2013). • Get the accreditation function of state governments to agree that innovation needs to be a goal. • Develop and distribute grade-level-specific materials called “The Educate to Innovate Curriculum,” tied to science standards, with a student activity prong and a teacher professional development prong. Teachers can earn credit for taking the course. Start the curriculum in grade 2, with video accessible via You Tube. All materials should be available on the web and without cost. (p. 64)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Develop or refine assessment tools to see if they are working. For example, ask students how their specific learning experiences worked. (p. 65)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nistor, N., Baltes, B., Dascălu, M., Mihăilă, D., Smeaton, G., &amp;amp; Trăuşan-Matu, Ş. (2014). Participation in virtual academic communities of practice under the influence of technology acceptance and community factors. A learning analytics application. Computers in Human Behavior, 34, 339–344. doi:10.1016/j.chb.2013.10.051&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a typical learning analytics research even though &amp;lsquo;learning analytics&amp;rsquo; is featured in the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Educational technology acceptance (p. 340)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prominent acceptance theory is Venkatesh’s Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT; Venkatesh et al., 2003, 2012) that explains the use of educational technology under the influence of use intention, further determined by performance and effort expectancy, and social influence. Additionally, facilitating conditions and computer anxiety (Nistor, Lerche, Weinberger, Ceobanu, &amp;amp; Heymann, 2012) directly affect the use of educational technology. (p. 340)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical review of technology acceptance models including UTAUT was done by Bagozzi (2007) who observed the oversimplifying, unidimensional definition of acceptance (p. 340)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ1 (acceptance model verification): To what extent do acceptance factors (technology use intention, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and technology anxiety) predict participation in vCoP? RQ2 (CoP model verification): Does participation in vCoP significantly mediate the influence of expertise on expert status? (p. 340)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participation in vCoP was operationalized as the number of interventions of each vCoP member. The quality of these interventions was considered as an indicator of expertise. Expert status was measured as betweenness centrality in the vCoP social network, i.e. the number of shortest paths connecting all vCoP members with each other and passing through that particular member. All three CoP variables were automatically determined. (p. 341)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;intervention&lt;br /&gt;
 What does ‘intervention’ mean in this paper?? Confusing. (p. 341)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, each forum discussion thread was represented as a graph with interventions as nodes and ‘‘reply to’’ relationships as links. The cohesion graph (Dasca ̆lu, Dessus, Tra ̆ußsan-Matu, Bianco, &amp;amp; Nardy, 2013), built using semantic distances in WordNet (Budanitsky &amp;amp; Hirst, 2006; Miller, 1995), Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer &amp;amp; Dumais, 1997) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei, Ng, &amp;amp; Jordan, 2003), was used for determining the quality of the interventions. (p. 341)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the members of this vCoP were the target population of the study, the examined sample consisted of N = 133 participants, whose gender, age and position are displayed in Table 1. (p. 341)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acceptance variables technology use intention, performance and effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and technology anxiety were measured by questionnaire (p. 341)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CoP model could be entirely confirmed in the vCoP setting. Participants’ expertise, i.e. their quality of interventions had a significant impact on their participation/use behavior (b = .99, p &amp;lt; .000), explaining the variance in participation almost entirely (R2 = .98), whereas participants’ time spent in the CoP had no significant effect. (p. 342)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test the mediating effect of participation, in the first step a regression analysis was performed with participant’s number of interventions as predictor and participant’s expert status as criterion (b = .92, p &amp;lt; .001); the residual variance of participant’s expert status was saved. In the second step, another regression analysis was performed with the quality of interventions as a predictor and the residual variance calculated in the first step as a criterion. The effect measured by the latter regression analysis was non-significant, showing that the mediating effect of participation was significant. (p. 342)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acceptance model could be only partially confirmed. Performance expectancy (b = .30, p &amp;lt; .01), effort expectancy (b = .19, p&amp;lt;.05), and social influence (b=.22, p&amp;lt;.05), significantly impacted use intention, explaining one third of its variance (R2 = .33). (p. 342)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to apply learning analytics to verify the CoP model (Nistor &amp;amp; Fischer, 2012) and the acceptance model (UTAUT; Venkatesh et al., 2003, 2012) in vCoP setting. (p. 343)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learning analytics (Siemens &amp;amp; Gasevic, 2012) application was successful, as far as data extracted from online discussions could be used to verify two major conceptual models of the Educational Sciences. (p. 344)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For educational practice, this study prepared the development of automated tools for monitoring and assessment of collaboration in vCoP platforms. Such tools may be employed, e.g. to improve mentoring of virtual faculty in its various forms. (p. 344)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning analytics&lt;br /&gt;
 This article features a title including ‘learning analytics’. However, its relationship with learning analytics only becomes clearer when discussing future possibilities of tools. The main body of the work is survey research, with discussion forum analysis part of the work. It’s more an analysis of online interactions in vCoP rather than analytics. (p. 344)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine the role of vocabulary in writing across three genres. Fifth graders (N = 105) wrote three compositions: story, persuasive, and informative. Each composition revolved around the topic of outer space to control for background knowledge. Written compositions were scored for holistic writing quality and several different vocabulary constructs: diversity, maturity, elaboration, academic words, content words, and register. The results indicated that students vary their vocabulary usage by genre. Story text had higher diversity than informative text as well as higher maturity as compared to persuasive text. Persuasive text contained higher diversity than informative text, and higher register than both of the other genres. Informative text included more content words and elaboration than the other text types as well as more maturity than persuasive text. Additionally, multiple regression and commonality analysis indicated that the vocabulary constructs related to writing quality differed by genre. For story text, vocabulary diversity was a unique predictor, while for persuasive text, content words and register were unique predictors. Finally, for informative text content words was the strongest unique predictor explaining almost all of the total variance in the five factor model, although maturity was also a unique predictor. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is a complex process, involving the coordination of many high-level cognitive and meta-cognitive skills. Seminal models of the writing process (e.g., (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flower &amp;amp; Hayes, 1981; Hayes, 1996; Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 1987) suggest that producing a quality written text requires generating and organizing ideas, goal- setting, planning, drafting, revising, and continuously self-monitoring performance. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one area that has received little attention is the relationship between vocabulary and quality within written compositions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One resource, long-term memory, helps explain how vocabulary may be used in the writing process. Flower and Hayes (1980) discuss long-term memory within their explanation of the translating process (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scardamalia and Bereiter’s (1987) knowledge-telling model—a model of developing writing—expands on this link between vocabulary and long-term memory. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content knowledge includes specific knowledge related to the topic of the written text. Discourse knowledge includes procedural knowledge (how to compose quality text), and genre knowledge (the important features of different genres). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students who possess a higher degree of content and discourse knowledge are predicted to compose texts of higher quality than those who lack such knowledge (e.g., Benton, Corkill, Sharp, Downey, &amp;amp; Khramtsova, 1995; DeGroff, 1987; Langer, 1984; McCutchen, 1986; Olinghouse &amp;amp; Graham, 2009). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary is implicated in each of these knowledge-spaces. Vocabulary conveys content knowledge because many topics have specialized vocabulary (Harmon, Hedrick, &amp;amp; Wood, 2005). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they express their knowledge in a way which is valued and accepted by the discourse community for that field (e.g., Swales, 1988). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary also is implicated in discourse knowledge because it is hypothesized to be a distinguishing feature of different genres of text (Biber, 1988; Halliday &amp;amp; Hasan, 1976). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary constructs and measures (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently measured vocabulary constructs in writing include: diversity, maturity, content vocabulary, academic vocabulary, and register. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary diversity, likely the most common vocabulary construct included in past writing research, refers to the breadth of words used in a text (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary maturity is a construct describing the sophistication of the vocabulary used in a text. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content vocabulary, sometimes referred to as ‘‘domain-specific vocabulary’’ (Marzano &amp;amp; Pickering, 2005)or ‘‘technical terms’’ (Harmon, Wood, &amp;amp; Medina, 2009; Rehder et al., 1998), refers to words that are unique to different topics (e.g., weather, Civil War, outer space). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;academic vocabulary is comprised of words used in a variety of academic contexts (e.g., synthesize, confirm, deduce) rather than words associated with specific disciplines or topics. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;register is a construct which describes the unique features of language which vary according to different situations, purposes, and forms of language use (Biber &amp;amp; Vasquez, 2008; Halliday &amp;amp; Hasan, 1976). Register has been shown to vary according to linguistic mode (oral vs. written; Biber, 2009), and according to text type (Biber &amp;amp; Kurjian, 2007). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier measures simply included the number of different or unique words (Barenbaum, Newcomer, &amp;amp; Nodine, 1987; Grobe, 1981) or a ratio of types to tokens (i.e., number of words written; Johnson, 1944). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;corrected type-token ratio (CTTR; Carroll, 1964) attempted to remove the effect of text length (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent developments in measuring lexical diversity have attempted to overcome this barrier by using complex computer algorithms. For example, the Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD; McCarthy &amp;amp; Jarvis, 2010) virtually eliminates text length as a confounding issue. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary, genre, and quality (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three commonly assessed genres in writing are narrative, persuasive, and informative text. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a cross-sectional study of fifth-, eighth-, and eleventh-graders, Grobe (1981) found vocabulary diversity to be a significant predictor of narrative writing quality. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three measures of vocabulary maturity predicted writing quality in the fifth-grade sample: rank, vocabulary repeat rate, and average word size. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olinghouse and Leaird (2009) also found that measures of vocabulary diversity were significant predictors of narrative writing quality for second- and fourth- graders. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose of the present study (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first study of its kind to explore such relationships in all three of the primary text-types, and to investigate relationships between vocabulary and writing quality in persuasive text. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We selected vocabulary constructs and measures that had the potential to be predictive of writing quality in different genres (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of hypotheses, the following research questions (RQ) guided the present study: RQ1: For fifth-grade writers, are measures of vocabulary stable across three written genres? RQ2: For fifth-grade writers, which vocabulary measures predict writing quality? Do the vocabulary predictors of writing quality vary across genres? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methodology (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final participants included 107 students from the six classrooms described above. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compare students to a nationally-normed sample of fifth-grade students, the Spontaneous Writing test of the Test of Written Language-3 (TOWL-3; Hammill &amp;amp; Larsen, 1996; all reliabilities range from .83 to .92 for fifth-grade students) was administered (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procedures (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall writing quality (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each rubric evaluated four aspects of writing: (1) Development of Ideas (Elaboration), (2) Organization, (3) Sentences/Word Choice/Voice, and (4) Genre Elements. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity Vocabulary diversity was calculated using the Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD, McCarthy &amp;amp; Jarvis, 2010), included as part of the Gramulator software program (McCarthy, Watanabi, &amp;amp; Lamkin, in press). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maturity Mature vocabulary was assessed by comparing the vocabulary used in students’ text to the General Service List (GSL; West, 1953). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content vocabulary In this study, content vocabulary was assessed using a researcher-developed list of vocabulary words highly associated with the topic ‘‘outer space’’. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) solar system (e.g., planets, sun, earth.), (b) space exploration and travel (e.g., astronaut, space ship, shuttle), &amp;copy; galaxies/ universes (e.g., black hole, quasar, white dwarf), and (d) astronomy (e.g., telescope, Hubble, astronomer). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text was collected from 160 websites whose Flesch–Kincaid reading levels fell between Grades 2–9 (average reading level = 5.8) and from 3 comprehensive books on outer space targeted toward upper elementary students. The text was then analyzed using the Concordance software program (Watt, 2000) which identified 119,261 words, of which 8,333 were unique. A word was only included in the content vocabulary list if it had a minimum of 10 occurrences in the corpus (reducing the list to 1,218), and was deemed by three RAs to be essential to outer space content and unlikely to be found in other unrelated content areas. This produced a list of 159 words. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the content vocabulary list was compared to a general corpus to ensure that the words on the list occurred significantly more often in the outer space corpus than in a corpus of general text (Educator’s Word Frequency Guide; Zeno, Ivens, Millard, &amp;amp; Duvvuri, 1995). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elaboration Elaboration was assessed by determining the average number of modifiers per noun phrase in a text using CohMetrix (McNamara, Louwerse, Cai, &amp;amp; Graesser, 2005). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Register This study used the proportion of words in a text of Latinate origin as compared to Germanic origin (Bar-Ilan &amp;amp; Berman, 2007) as a measure of register. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academic words The Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000) includes 570 word families and approximately 3,000 total words that frequently occur in many types of academic text. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though academic vocabulary was measured in the study, means (.01) revealed that the fifth-graders in this sample included a very small percentage of such vocabulary in their compositions. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrative text had higher diversity than informative text as well as higher maturity as compared to persuasive text. Persuasive text contained higher diversity than informative text, and higher register than both of the other genres. Informative text included more content words and elaboration than the other text types as well as more maturity than persuasive text. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research question 2: Which vocabulary measures predict writing quality? (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bivariate correlations among the vocabulary measures and writing quality for each genre are presented in Tables 3 and 4. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regression model predicting story writing quality was significant. Vocab- ulary diversity and maturity explained approximately 9 % of the variance in narrative quality, although only vocabulary diversity was a significant unique predictor. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model predicting persuasive writing quality also was significant. Vocabulary diversity, the inclusion of content words, and the use of a higher linguistic register explained approximately 14 % of the variance in persuasive writing quality. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model predicting informative writing quality was significant. The overall model explained almost half of the variance (46 %) in informative writing quality. After controlling for the other predictors in the model, maturity and content words were significant unique predictors. Content words was the strongest unique predictor, explaining 31 % of the total variance. Maturity was the only other variable that contributed unique prediction, 3.4 % (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not directly testing causal mechanisms within the Knowledge Telling Model (Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 1987), the results support the premise that genre knowledge and topic knowledge are knowledge bases students access to select appropriate words while composing written text. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite an emphasis on academic vocabulary in late elementary and secondary settings (e.g., Lawrence, White, &amp;amp; Snow, 2010) and the inclusion of academic vocabulary in CCSS Language standards (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2010): ‘‘Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate general academic and domain-specific words and phrases &amp;hellip;’’ (p. 29), fifth-grade students in this study included very few academic words in their written compositions, regardless of the genre. On average, approximately 1 % of words were academic words, translating to around 1.5 academic words in each written composition. In comparison, published text for fifth-grade students included 0.8 % academic words in narrative text, and 2.7 % academic words in expository text (Gardner, 2004). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagy and Scott (2000) and Scott, Lubliner, and Hiebert (2006) provide an overview of the common vocabulary constructs underlying word selection and assessment tasks typically found in word learning instruction. Nagy and Scott identified five constructs: incrementality, multidimensionality, polysemy, interrelatedness, and heterogeneity. Scott et al. added additional constructs such as breadth, accuracy, automaticity, and semantic decision making. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A considerable lack of overlap occurs between word learning research and writing research. An argument can be made that breadth (Scott et al., 2006; general vocabulary knowledge), and diversity (index of number of unique words in writing) share some commonalities; however, other constructs between the two fields have few similarities. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article contrasts two kinds of &lt;em&gt;dynamic network analysis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;landmark window and sliding window&amp;mdash;by applying both approaches to analysis of a customer network. Besides comparisons of well-known network metrics (e.g., centrality, density), it also tracks development of sub-communities in the network. In particular, it applies an interesting algorithm named MEC (never explained in the paper) to track community evolution, i.e., birth, survival and death. I found this part most interesting for this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a nice intro to two different approaches of dynamic network analysis which could be applied to other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This study uses Gephi for data analysis. Additional resources I found online using R to conduct dynamic network analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sliding windows focus on the most recent past thus allowing to capture current events. The application of the proposed methodology on a real-world customer network suggests that both window models provide complementary information. Nevertheless, the sliding window model is able to capture better the recent changes of the network. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Network Analysis techniques can play a key role in business analytics. By modelling the implicit relationships among customers as a social network, it is possible to understand how patterns in these relationships translate into competitive advantages for the company. Additionally, the incorporation of the temporal dimension in such analysis can help detect market trends and changes in customers’ preferences. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to examine the dynamics of customer communities, which relies on two different time window models: a landmark and a sliding window. Landmark windows keep all the historical data and treat all nodes and links equally, even if they only appear at the early stages of the network life. Such approach is appropriate for the longterm analysis of networks, but may fail to provide a realistic picture of the current evolution. On the other hand, (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define customer network as a finite set of customers who are linked to each other if they bought at least one similar product during a given timeframe. Modelling customer-related data using this type of customer networks has the advantage of revealing implicit relationships among customers based on their purchasing behaviour over a given time period. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most related work to ours is the one by Saganowski et al. (2012). In this work, the authors carry out an empirical study of the influence of several time window models (e.g. sliding window with no overlap, overlapping sliding window, landmark window) on the number of detected community events (e.g. forming, shrinking, merging, splitting). Based on their experiments, they conclude that the choice of the granularity at which the time varying network is snapshotted impacts the results of the method used to extract community dynamics. While landmark windows prove to be useful to detect stable communities, the sliding window model with overlap is more suitable for extracting community evolution in rapidly changing social networks. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one of the key features of many networks is that their structure evolves over time, so approaches focusing on the analysis of a fixed snapshot of the network may fail to capture the dynamics of the evolving network. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another relevant research is the one by Falkowski et al. (2006), who developed a twopronged methodology to analyse the evolution of two types of dynamic communities in social networks: communities with rather stable membership structure and communities with high fluctuation of members. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;methodologies relying on accumulated windows (aka landmark windows) can only discover small changes in communities in consecutive timeframes and any drastic change in short time may potentially remain undetected. Unlike landmark windows, sliding windows focus on the most recent state of the dynamic network when analysing their evolution, thus being able to capture more up-to-date events, especially when dealing with volatile networks. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our contributions are threefold: (a) application of dynamic community mining in a real-world customer network for the purpose of identifying different evolutionary profiles of customers; (b) use of a sliding window model in the study of community evolution as a complement to the conventional landmark window model and; &amp;copy; extension of a previously proposed event-based (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the significant body of literature addressing the problem of dynamic network analysis (see Berger et al. 2010, for an overview of the topic) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;framework for monitoring clusters dynamics, dubbed MEC (Oliveira and Gama 2012), to tackle the problem of community evolution. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Background (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3 Dynamic community mining (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities are unstable patterns that can evolve in both membership and content. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike landmark windows, the sliding window model (Datar et al. 2002) incorporates a time-based forgetting mechanism, keeping only the latest information inside the window and disregarding all the data falling outside the window. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past research on community mining discarded the temporal information by modelling the dynamic network as a static graph. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a drawback, it might be hard to determine the right parameter settings. It is important to note that there is a trade-off between the window length and the ability to capture changes. Small windows will capture rapid changes, but lose information (memory) about network stability. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent work proposes to characterize the evolution of a given community by describing its life-cycle, i.e. a series of critical events undergone by communities over time (Palla et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2009; Asur et al. 2009; Greene et al. 2010; Takaffoli et al. 2011; Bro ́ka et al. 2013). Typically, these approaches rely on a landmark window model for the process of extracting the snapshots of the evolving network, since they take into consideration all the historical network data collected up to the current time point. Alternative models, such as the sliding window, are embedded with forgetting mechanisms that drop older data from the analysis thus allowing to uncover the most recent changes occurring in the network. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Methodology (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.4 Window models (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landmark windows (Gehrke et al. 2001) encompass all the data from a specific point in time up to the current moment. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model is initialized by first selecting a fixed time point (the so-called landmark), which marks the beginning of the time window, and then it grows the window by considering all the data seen so far after the landmark. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main steps are: (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis and description of the dynamic network, at both the network-level and node-level, using wellknown SNA metrics; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application of our extended community evolution framework, dubbed MECnet, to each window setting; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation of the dynamics of customers’ communities (or profiles). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the node-level, we analyse the following metrics for undirected networks: eigenvector centrality and betweenness. At the network-level, we focus on density and modularity (Newman and Girvan 2004). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEC is a framework proposed by Oliveira and Gama (2012) to monitor the evolution of clusters. MEC traces evolution through the detection and categorization of clusters transitions, such as births, splits and merges. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this information, MECnet then models the communities and their transitions as nodes, respectively weighted edges, in an evolution graph (i.e. consecutive sets of weighted bipartite graphs). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manipulation, visualization and analysis of the network is performed on Gephi (Bastian et al. 2009) by making use of its dynamic network analysis features. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Case study (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the landmark model, we start with a window of 3 months and then we cumulatively grow the window by adding one month at each step. For the overlapping sliding model, we set the window length to 3 months (w &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 3) and its step width to one month. In both cases, the total number of timesteps is 10. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNA techniques to perform an exploratory analysis of their customers purchasing behaviour, so as to identify differentiable customers’ profiles (or customers’ communities) and their evolution over a given year. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1 Network data (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We detect the communities at each Wk using the Louvain method (Blondel et al. 2008) since it produces disjoint partitions of good quality, in a very fast way. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we evaluate both approaches based on a double perspective. First, we compute a quantitative measure, namely the Survival Ratio proposed by Spiliopoulou et al. (2006), to measure network volatility and the frequency of community transitions in both scenarios. This ratio is given in Eq. (2) and it basically computes the portion of communities found at timestep Wk (k &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 1; :::; 10) that survived in WkþDt . (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We compute the following SNA metrics, which were considered to be of higher relevance within the scope of this case study: eigenvector centrality, betweenness, density and modularity. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we qualitatively assess the actionable insights derived from the analysis of each window model, from the business viewpoint. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning the sliding window, we observe an overall instability in the metrics values. This was expected due to the time-based forgetting mechanism incorporated in the model. The fluctuation of the eigenvector centrality suggests a lack of customers’ purchasing activity. This is related to the company’s business nature, which relies on long-term projects and high added value products which, in turn, are typically associated with low-frequency purchases. Once again, the density of the network is close to zero, due to the sparsity of links between customers. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MECnet detects several types of events which mirror the dynamics of communities. In this paper, we focus only on survivals, births and deaths since they were found to be more representative of the dynamics occurring at the community-level. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total number of survival, birth and death events detected by MECnet (with a survival threshold of s &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 0:5) for both window approaches, at each timestep interval, is provided in Fig. 7. From the analysis of these figures, we can deduce that the overlapping sliding window model is able to capture the unstable community structure of the customer network, by focusing only on the most recent past. This volatility is reflected on the high number of births and deaths and relatively low number of survivals and is captured by the values of the survival ratio (see Fig. 7). These differences on the number of events show the potential of the sliding window in capturing temporary acute changes occurring in the network, reflecting more closely the changes in customers’ preferences for products. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the analysis of the dynamics of the customer network using the sliding window approach, as a complement of the traditional landmark window, allows us to identify the migration of customers between communities. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 Conclusions and future work (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present the first results of our exploratory analysis on the company’s customer network. This network uncovers the similarities of purchasing behaviour among the company’s customers. The application of dynamic community mining using two different time window models allowed us to identify the evolutionary profile of groups of customers and grasp insights into the customer base. The results suggest that both window models provide complementary information regarding the dynamics of the underlying network. While the landmark window considers all the historical data, the sliding window employs a catastrophic forgetting of older data, focusing only on the most recent past. Given these distinct perspectives, the sliding window approach proves to be more suitable for, e.g. detecting changes in customers’ purchasing behaviour, whereas landmark windows are more appropriate to identify persistent customers’ profiles. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;alternative time window approaches (e.g. accumulated time windows with fading links) (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onnela, J.-P., Waber, B. N., Pentland, A., Schnorf, S., &amp;amp; Lazer, D. (2014). Using sociometers to quantify social interaction patterns. Scientific Reports, 4, 1–8. doi:10.1038/srep05604&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most clear description of how sociometers work. Study focuses on gender difference in terms of proximity and talkativeness. &amp;ldquo;The strongest effect discovered in our study is the difference in gender participation as a function of tie strength and group size.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;self-reported accounts of behaviour are prone to biases and necessarily reduce the range of behaviours, and the number of subjects, that may be studied simultaneously. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of ever smaller sensors makes it possible to study group-level human behaviour in naturalistic settings outside research laboratories. We used such sensors, sociometers, to examine gender, talkativeness and interaction style in two different contexts. Here, we find that in the collaborative context, women were much more likely to be physically proximate to other women and were also significantly more talkative than men, especially in small groups. In contrast, there were no gender-based differences in the non-collaborative setting. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;esearch on human social interactions has relied on observations reported by humans, and both selfreported data and observer-recorded data, with varying degrees of observer involvement, have been used to quantify interactions. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysing human behaviour based on electronically generated data has recently become popular. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we used ‘‘sociometers,’’ which are wearable devices that use a high-frequency radio transmitter to gauge physical proximity to others, and a microphone to track speech, to collect detailed information on social interactions within particular contexts. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early explorations with sociometers have shown that even short, sliced signals can be powerful predictors for human communication4,8–10. We used the radio transmitter to infer whether and for how long any two participants were proximate to one another. The strength of the received signal was used to estimate the distance between sociometers, and we used a cut-off value of signal strength that corresponded to a physical distance of approximately 3 meters. The sociometer did not store raw audio data, but rather computed audio features that were used to infer speaking time, measured in seconds, for each participant. Finally, the signals from the built-in accelerometers, the third stream of data recorded, were used to ascertain that the participants wore the devices throughout the period of observation by monitoring the level of energy associated with their movement (see Methods). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone communication data have recently enabled the exploration12 and modelling13 of (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;large-scale social networks, and they have also been used to investigate sex differences in the age and sex composition of conversation partners14. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To carry out the analyses, in each Setting we first divided the 12 hours of data into 144 segments, corresponding to 5-minute time windows. In the resulting networks constructed from these data segments, any two individuals were linked if they had been proximate to one another for at least the duration of one full time window. Encounters that did not fully cover at least one time window were deemed inconsequential and were not included as ties in the network. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore the relationship between gender and context, we collected data in two settings (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting 1 encompassed the first day (12 hours) of an intense one-week long collaborative exercise at the end of the first year of a two-year Master’s program at a public policy school in a private US university. The students, who had previously earned their first degrees and were now pursuing subsequent professional degrees, were required to process a large quantity of sophisticated readings and lectures, within a week, into a memo with a policy recommendation. Communication with other students was allowed. The performance of the students in the exercise affected their final course grade. We collected and analysed data from 79 students (42 males, 37 females). Setting 2, in contrast to Setting 1, was entirely unstructured and non-collaborative. We collected data from 54 co-located employees (16 males and 38 females) at a call centre in a major US banking firm. We analysed their behaviour during 12 one-hour lunch breaks, spanning several weeks, which the employees would typically spend in a cafeteria, in relatively small groups, in the same building. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proximity (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using 5minute windows, the mean degree of subjects was 4.5 in Setting 1 and (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.1 in Setting 2. In both settings, females and males had a similar number of connections, 4.8 vs. 4.1 in Setting 1 and 7.1 vs. 7.2 in Setting 2, respectively. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incorporate the role of tie persistence in our analyses, we used the measured durations of proximity as tie strengths in the resulting aggregate network. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talkativeness (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talkativeness of individuals is computed in a large number of time windows; although the raw data are collected at 750 Hz, the audio features are calculated at 50 Hz, still a high frequency. Instead of dealing with the raw audio signal, we use the variance of the audio signal in a range of frequencies typically associated with human voice (see Methods and Fig. 5), which is a more robust way to distinguish between whether the signal comes from the person wearing the sociometer, or whether it corresponds to ambient noise (e.g., someone else talking). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quantify the talkativeness of a person by taking the average of the variance of voice signal in each window (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data from each setting can be represented as matrix X, where the rows corresponds to the subjects (i) and the columns to the time windows (t). We express the average talkativeness of a person, male or female, by the temporal average yi ~ð1=T Þ XT xit . To compare t~1 the talkativeness of males and females, we compute the median of the y variables for males and females, resulting in ~y and ~y , respectiMF ively. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of the talk-ratio variable r under the gender-neutral null model is shown in Fig. 2 (see also Methods). We found that the observed value of 1.62 in Setting 1 is statistically significantly different from 1 (p , 0.01), whereas the value of 1.04 in Setting 2 is not. We conclude that women are substantially more talkative in Setting 1, but there is no difference in the talkativeness of men and women in Setting 2. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While weak (short aggregate proximity) ties may be ‘‘accidental,’’ strong ties (extensive aggregate proximity) more likely are evidence of intended social interactions. We found that in Setting 1, there is a systematic overrepresentation of FF ties and an under-representation of MM ties. Further, this over-representation of FF ties increases monotonically with the threshold weight w as the following results, based on 10,000 permutation replications, demonstrate. In the non-thresholded network (threshold w 5 0), there is only weak evidence to suggest that FF-ties might be over-represented: We obtain the ratio 1.21 (90% CI: 0.96, 1.52) under unconstrained permutation and 1.01 (90% CI: 0.92, 1.08) under constrained permutation. However, in the strongly thresholded network (threshold w 5 20), FF-ties are substantially overrepresented: We obtain the ratio 2.94 (90% CI: 1.20, 6.00) under unconstrained permutation and 1.98 (90% CI: 1.04, 3.43) under constrained permutation. In contrast to Setting 1, in Setting 2 there is no perceptible statistically significant relationship between the frequency of FF, FM, or MM ties. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We combine the proximity and talkativeness data of sociometers to examine talkativeness as a function of interaction partners. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, in Setting 1 women appear to have more high-persistence ties than men do, whereas in Setting 2 this is not the case. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strongest effect discovered in our study is the difference in gender participation as a function of tie strength and group size. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, an earlier study, which did not consider the proximity of others, found no significant gender differences in individual talkativeness15, compatible with our results for Setting 2. In Setting 1, women were much more likely to associate with other women than men, and thus were also more talkative (with the exception of the briefing). These findings are consistent with prior research indicating that women tend to have more interactive learning styles than men23. Our results also highlight the role of context. Constructionist and contextualist models of gender assert that activity is a highly influential moderator of gender-related variations in social behaviour7,24,25. Our results clearly support the notion (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 | Using sociometers to study physical proximity and talkativeness. Top: Every participant in each Setting was wearing an identical sociometer, which had a built-in radio transmitter and microphone. The radio transmitter was able to sense others who were within a radius of approximately 3 meters from the subject. In the corresponding network representation, a tie connects two individuals if they have been within this distance for at least one time window. The builtin microphones were used to assess the talkativeness of each individual, giving rise to the metric x(t) for each individual as shown. Bottom: Schematic of the construction of the audio signals xi(t) and yi for node i. The raw audio signal, as recorded by the built-in microphone and temporarily stored on the sociometer for processing. This raw signal is first channeled to an array of band-pass filters encapsulating the range of typical human speech (see Methods), and the variance of the resulting human voice signal is shown. We then divide the temporal domain into time windows, and the average of the variance (lower panel) within each window gives the audio signal xi(t) in time window t, pictorially represented by the horizontal lines within each time window. To express the overall talkativeness of a person, we take the temporal average of xi(t) over all time windows, giving rise to yi for subject i. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gender differences in both physical proximity and talkativeness are strongly present in the more structured task-oriented context (Setting 1), whereas they completely disappear in unstructured non-task-oriented context (Setting 2). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results appear relevant also in a larger context. More and more problems are solved in groups, and recent studies have indeed shown that diverse groups of problem solvers, referring to groups of people with diverse tools and skills, consistently outperform groups of the best and the brightest, a finding captured by the aphorism ‘‘diversity trumps ability’’26,27. Research is also increasingly done in teams across nearly all fields, and teams typically produce more frequently cited research than individuals do, including the exceptionally highimpact research28. Another recent study suggests that a ‘‘general collective intelligence factor’’ of a group is not strongly correlated with the intelligence of the individual group members, but instead with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group29. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sociometer accelerometer. An accelerometer measures changes in experienced acceleration. The badge’s 3-axis accelerometer signal is sampled at 50 Hz, which is able to capture a wide range of human movement, given that 99% of the acceleration power during daily human activities is contained below 15 Hz30. The range of values for the accelerometer signal varies between 23 g and 13 g, where g 5 9.81 m/s2 is the gravitational acceleration. In our study, we used data from the accelerometer to determine if the participants wore the sociometers. Each accelerometer measured energy levels due to physical movement above the reference level of 1 unit4, ascertaining that the subjects wore the sociometers as instructed. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sociometer microphone. The microphone within the badge did not store raw audio data, but rather computed audio features that were used to infer speaking patterns. The microphone in the sociometer was connected to an array of band-pass filters that divided the speech frequency spectrum into four octaves: (1) 85 to 222 Hz, (2) 222 to 583 Hz, (3) 583 to 1,527 Hz, and (4) 1,527 to 4,000 Hz. These frequencies encapsulate the range of typical human speech. In particular, in this study we examined the variation in the audio signal that arrived from sample to sample (the sampling frequency was 750 Hz). The more variation there is present in the signal, the more confident we can be that the associated signal is indeed human speech and not due to an external source. Audio features like these can be used not only to infer that a person is speaking, but they can also capture nonlinguistic social signals, such as interest and excitement31. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sociometer radio. The built-in omni-directional 2.4 GHz radio was designed to detect physically proximate interactions. The radios sent a transmission once every minute that contained the ID of the sending badge, some synchronisation information, and error correction bytes. By measuring the received signal strength, it was possible to estimate the distance to the sender. We used a cut-off on the signal strength value to register people who were located within 3 meters of one another. This distance was deemed to be appropriate for detecting a level of physical proximity that likely corresponds to an intentional social interaction. Since the subjects were free to move around the premises, depending on the given physical environment surrounding them, which would affect the transmission of radio waves, there is an error of 1.5 meters on the distance estimates32. This means that we cannot rule out the possibility that two individuals at 4.5 meters would have appeared to be physically proximate and, similarly, it is possible that some individuals would have needed to be within 1.5 meters in order to have been registered as having been physically proximate. Due to these spurious detections, there are likely some false positive and some false negatives in our dataset. Identical instrumentation, i.e., the fact that each subject wore an identical device, ensures that there was no person-to-person variability in how distance (or any other behavioural signal) was measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oshima, J. (1998). Differences in Knowledge-Building Between Two Types of Networked Learning Environments: An Information-Flow Analysis. Journal of Educational Computing Research, 19(3), 329–351. doi:10.2190/YLLX-M9CW-15X9-BJJ9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting work comparing S-CSILE with D-CSILE. A probable indication of pedagogical transition from intentional learning to KB and also tech transition from CSILE to KF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding schemes are also interesting &amp;ndash; revealing an earlier differentiation of referent vs. problem-based knowledge which gets less discussed in later literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the present study was to examine how elementary school students improve their scientific discourse on a computer-networked database environment called “Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE).” (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;utilizing different system configurations: single-note based (S-CSILE)vs. discussion-note based @-CSILE). Tracking files automatically recorded by the system were used for an analysis of students’ learning activities. Results showed that system affordance specially designed for joint written discourse in D-CSILE significantly facilitated students’ joint knowledge-transformation activities as well as maintained each individual’s activity to pursue her own agenda. Importance of such a system affordance was discussed from the perspective of distributed cognition. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting&lt;br /&gt;
 this paper sounds quite unique: &lt;strong&gt;tech evolution of KF&lt;/strong&gt; and KB’s connection with &lt;strong&gt;distributed cognition&lt;/strong&gt;. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;’ h o concepts for developing computer-supportedenvironmentsin recent research are collaboration and media-richness (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer-support has been said to make students’ collaboration more flexible and free from physical and temporary limitations. In particular,computernetworked environments are expected to create an asynchronous type of communication in addition to regular synchronous communications. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of technology (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media-richness plays another critical role in developing computer-supported learning environments. Students should be able to manipulate and share with others their knowledge by representing it in a variety of ways. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our purpose of the development of learning environments is to lead students to engage in authentic learning activities, we need a process-oriented methodology for the assessment rather than product or performance-oriented assessments. In this study, I attempted to create a methodological framework to analyze students’ learning activities in computer-supported learning environments by describing their activities from the perspective of knowledge-building,andexaminingstudents’interactionwithalearningenvironment system from the perspective of distributed cognifion. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentic Classroom Activity as Knowledge-Building and Computer Support for Knowledge-Building (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bereiter and Scardamalia [7, 81 argued, what is missing in traditional classrooms is students’ engagement in activities of generating ideas superior to previous ones through their discourse. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent studies in cognitive science suggest that other types of knowledge which we mostly rely on in performing our activities in the world are situated in contexts where we act to attain specific goals [9]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, the activities themselves should be regarded as our expertise [lo, 111. In the sense of expertise as process, Bereiter and Scardamalia propose that students’ authentic learning should be described as their engagement in knowledge-building [ 101. Knowledge-building is an activity in which students are involved in collaboratively constructing knowledge based on their own problems through coordination of their own knowledge and new knowledge coming into them. In this activity, students are not only engaged in passively internalizing knowledge, but also externalizing knowledge as object for further advancement of their shared knowledge in their immediate community (i.e., their classroom). Thus, “authenticity” for students in the classroom is not only that they can learn something new within appropriate contexts, but also that they can engage in productive activities in which we as a society are continuously advancing our knowledge. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE)” is designed to support students’authentic learning activitiesasknowledge-building [8, 10, 121. First, the framework of the writing process is supported in such a way as to have learners use a “knowledge-transforming” strategy rather than “knowledge-telling” strategy [131. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the framework of learning as problem-solving is emphasized. In CSILE, students can indicate the status of their thoughts in their notes such as “problem,” “what I already know,” and “new learning.” (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, some particular metacognitive thoughts can be made explicit in their notes. This potentially facilitates metacognitive reflection on what knowledge they do not have, compared with their knowledge represented in the database. Thus, learners can make use of CSILE as a tool for controlling their executive process of learning. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of technology&lt;br /&gt;
 enacting supports for control of executive process of learning (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, because of the community database feature, a type of asynchronous collaborative learning is possible in addition to the regular synchronous (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first year, twenty-nine students used a version of CSILE, “the single-note CSILE (S-CSILE),” in which they reported their thoughts on a study topic, electricity, in their individual text or graphical notes. Hence, the database was a compilation of such individual notes. Students organized and advanced their own and others’ thoughts by commenting on the notes and linking related notes [ 161. In the second year, twenty-seven students used another version, “the discussion-note CSILE (D-CSILE),” in which they reported their thoughts on a study topic, force, through collaborative written discourse on their shared problems in discussion notes [17] in addition to regular individual notes. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information-Flow as a Frameworkfor the Analysis of Human-Computer Interaction (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed cognition, a recently developed concept, assumes human beings as part of a more global information processing system rather than as independent information processors [18, 191. Knowledge and mental resources for the global system are widely distributed across people and available tools. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of distributed cognition, Perkins proposed a new level of analysis of human mind, cognition US information-flow [21]. He defined person-plus-surround as a unit of analysis of cognition, and focused on information-flow in the person-plus-surround system. Here, the focus of the analysis is no longer on how subjects&amp;rsquo; internal structures are constructed, but rather on how subjects work in the global system. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perkins suggested the following information-accesscharacteristics of the system: (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge When the global cognitive system functions in a task, various types of knowledgeareused,fromcontent-specificknowledgetohigher-orderknowledge such as monitoring and planning. In the present study, we focus on different types of descriptive knowledge in the database. Representation How knowledge is represented is another important aspect. Because CSILE is mainly driven by written discourse, we focus on the written form of knowledge. Retrieval Although desired knowledge is represented in the system, we cannot always access it in a contextually appropriate way. Studies have shown: 1) that experts usually learn necessary knowledge and skills in a problem-based situation so that they can easily access the necessary knowledge in their work, e.g., [22]; and 2) that authentic problem-based learning in a meaningful context can prompt learners’ acquisition of knowledge which can be later retrieved in an appropriate way, e.g., [23]. Here, we focus on how learners use their own and others’ knowledge represented in the database in advancing their progressive discourse. Consfrucfion “Construction” means the system’s information processing, such as assembling pieces of represented or retrieved knowledge. Recent studies on eflects with intellectual technologies [24] showed that computer support which allows learners to conceptually manipulate their represented knowledge improves the learners’ reflective processes in problem solving and helps them acquire higher levels of understanding, e.g., [25]. Here, we focus on two different planes of collaborative learning in which students engage in their learning in CSILE. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STUDY DESIGN (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuresfor Information-AccessCharacteristicsin CSILE (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solo-plane is a constructive arena where students develop their own understanding. Students’ activity in the solo-plane was examined by analyzing change in their written discourse from their own preceding discourse. The joint-plane is another arena where students contribute to the development of understanding in the classroom community. Activity in the joint-plane was examined by analyzing change in students’ written discourse from others’ preceding discourse, and students’commentarieson others’discourse. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students’ written discourse of graphics in each note was divided into units of ideas, then each unit was categorized as one of three types of knowledge items: referent-centeredknowledge,problem-centered knowledge, and reflective knowledge. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem-centered knowledge is process-oriented information, such as casual mechanisms which have potential to facilitate students’ understanding [26]. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrieval (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one knowledge item to another were identified: 1) howledge-widening, and 2) knowledge-deepening. Knowledge-wideningmeans that a new knowledge item develops by assimilating information in a preceding knowledge item. Knowledgedeepening means that a new knowledge item develops by accommodating information in a preceding knowledge item. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting is another measure for us to examine how students retrieved others’ knowledge to contribute to the development of their classroom knowledge. Because of small-sample problem, students’ commentaries were categorized on the basis of their potential of contribution as follows: 1) knmledge-widening oriented, 2 ) ktwwledge-deepening oriented, or 3 ) information-based (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESULTS AND DISCUSSION (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in System Affordances (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results in this study suggest that it is difficult for students to manage their progressive discourse in a simple note-database such as the S-CSILE,and they need a clear space such as discussion notes to keep problems in their minds, then collaborate with others. By providing students with interpersonal discourse spaces, the D-CSILEmight prompt students’ cognitive process of progressive discourse as follows (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, in the joint-plane, by providing students with opportunities to write collaboratively on the same problems, discussion notes might promote progressive discourse in several knowledge-transformingways. In the D-CSILE, students naturally engaged in knowledge-transformingactivities in the joint-plane of collaborative learning through coordination among different students’ ideas, i.e., transformation of others’ knowledge rather than their own knowledge. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting discussion&lt;br /&gt;
 interesting discussion connecting D-CSILE with important concepts such as ZPD, distributed cognition (people-plus), and then CoL. It might be fair to say that KB as a pedagogy is in its infancy at that stage — because its distinction with other approaches (e.g., CoL) is unclear and discussion heavily draws upon other concepts (e.g., distributed cognition)?&lt;br /&gt;
 Also interesting that the discussion of referent vs. problem-based knowledge appears less in later literature. Wondering what might have triggered the difference. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of a sociocultural approach to human development and learning [33-351,the transition provides educators with certain possibilities for efficient intervention. As vgotsky [33]suggested in his genetic law of human development, the intermental plane of development is the origin of intramental development. Joint-activities with others, mediated by sociocultural tools, create various learning opportunities for children, i.e., zones of proximal development. In discussion notes, students were involved in their joint activities with peers, creating various zones of proximal development.The database existed as an arena which represented students’ intermental plane of development. Thus, this arena has potential for helping educators to get involved in students’joint activities as expert learners who supervise students’peer activities. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of distributed cognition, the transition from the S-CSILE to the D-CSILE is interpreted as follows. In the D-CSILE, the classroom changed its structure from a compilation of student-plus to a students-plus. As Perkins suggested in his notion of distributed cognition, a total cognitive system in which multiple persons collaborate with each other is a real-life distributed cognitive system,“people-plus”developedbasedon“person-plus”[21].Thesamenotionis included in Engestriim’s triangular model of general activity [12]. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change in the activity system suggests a distinct educational implication; the importance of building a “community of learners” [ 101. “Community of learners” research suggests that school might be able to produce its maximum power as an educational institution by changing their system from “the traditional transmission model of knowledge from teachem to students,” to a “community of learners” in which every student can manifest hidher expertise and contributetoknowledge building in the classroom [37].The results in the research partially support the proposition that students’ activities at a community level lead them to higher conceptual progress. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oshima, J., Oshima, R., Murayama, I., Inagaki, S., Takenaka, M., Yamamoto, T., … Nakayama, H. (2006). Knowledge-building activity structures in Japanese elementary science pedagogy. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 1(2), 229–246. doi:10.1007/s11412-006-8995-8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to introduce KB into Japanese elementary classrooms: created two practical design principles&amp;mdash;idea-centered lesson and collective knowledge advancement&amp;mdash;based on 12 KB principles. In two design studies, these two practical principles were integrated with Japanese science activity structures. Considerations of local contexts when introducing KB is a sensible choice. In two design studies, they evaluated enactments of KB principles based on student participation. Two strategies reflected in this study: 1) it is challenging to target all KB principles at once; some are naturally more challenging (e.g., rise-above) but achieving one principles would open the door to another one; 2) treating teaching as a “design science” (REF) is an important approach for KB. In this study, recognizing study 1 demonstrated little awareness of community knowledge, the researchers adapted the activity structure in study 2 and added elements of offline classroom discussions. At the end of this study, they recognized a new challenge of coordinating scientific inquiry (e.g., build an experiment) and building conceptual knowledge. These two strategies are valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purposes of our study are: (1) to improve Japanese elementary science curriculum using knowledge-building practices, and (2) to contribute to the advancement of development principles for designing knowledge-building communities in classrooms. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we describe common Japanese elementary science activities and how they differ from knowledge-building practices (Scardamalia, 2002). Second, we discuss our redesign of Japanese elementary science lessons as knowledge-building practices by modifying and coordinating elementary science activities with a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) technology called Knowledge Forum. Finally, we report two design studies of modified elementary science lessons. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese elementary science activity structures: An established culture of learning (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons in Japanese schools have activity structures that are established through repeated research lessons (Rohlen &amp;amp; LeTendre, 1995). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linn, Lewis, Tsuchida, and Songer (2000) videotaped and analyzed ten science lessons in five elementary schools in the Tokyo region. From their analysis, they found eight typical activity structures. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on their students’ characteristics and classroom circumstances, science teachers in Japanese classrooms plan their lessons by using these activity structures. Each activity structure could function to facilitate the creation of a community of learners (Brown &amp;amp; Campione, 1996). When we as Bdeep constructivists’’ (Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 2002) sit in the classroom, however, we rarely see students engage in that kind of knowledge advancement. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoL vs KB&lt;br /&gt;
 interesting mentioning that these activity structures could help CoL but not KB. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason is that the activity structures identified by Linn et al. (2000) are not necessarily coordinated with each other to consolidate the classroom as a community of learners. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Brown and Campione (1996) point out, many failures in structuring the classroom as a community of learners stem from the fact that instructional designers do not have a systematic view on how to create a community of learners in classrooms. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason that these activity structures are not creating knowledgebuilding communities in Japanese classrooms is that not all communities of learners are necessarily knowledge-building communities (Scardamalia, 2002; Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 2002). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to facilitate different types of learning. In a community of learners, the learners have responsibility for their learning activities. However, their control or intentionality is usually constrained in a context where a teacher takes over most of the responsibility for designing learning materials, curricula, the structure of group work, and goals to accomplish. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contrasting CoL and KB&lt;br /&gt;
 interesting contrasts in the Japanese context (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese elementary science lessons fit this type of classroom environment. In the knowledge-building community, on the contrary, participants need to have more responsibility for their own activities and the design of their learning conditions in order to advance their understanding by themselves. They need to regularly engage in objectifying knowledge to be improvable and shared, and they need to use that knowledge to create new knowledge. Participants in a knowledge-building community are, therefore, required to learn strategies not only to understand given knowledge, but also to advance knowledge by themselves. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the knowledge-building classroom (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting&lt;br /&gt;
 interesting re-engineering of the KB principles — leading to two design principles for Japanese classrooms (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By referring to these 12 determinants of knowledge-building, we created two practical design principles. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first principle was that continuously improvable student ideas are centered in the learning practice. Determinants such as Breal ideas,’’ Bauthentic problems,’’ and Bimprovable ideas’’ were the most crucial issues that we found when designing lessons; our first principle is related to this realization. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are told by teachers to raise their ideas at some point, but this activity structure is not primarily designed for students to revisit their ideas for knowledge-building purposes. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second principle was that students should manage their ideas from diverse points of view and collaboratively advance their collective knowledge. This principle is related to determinants such as Bidea diversity,’’ Bcommunity knowledge,’’ Bcollective responsibility,’’ and Bsymmetric knowledge advancement.’’ In ordinary Japanese classrooms, the idea of diversity is a quite familiar issue. Students raise many ideas and opinions from their individual points of view. However, their diverse ideas are not transformed into super-ordinate ideas through collective and symmetric activities. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve student collaboration in the classroom, we applied our second principle to designing the participatory structure of student activities. Japanese activity structures are normally comprised of whole-class discussion and small-group work. We considered an intermediate level of the participatory structure: inter-group work. Inter-group work is an activity structure where students from different small groups share their ideas and comment on them in a way that bridges the whole classroom talk and the small group work. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Forum\ as a knowledge medium for facilitating the knowledge-building practice (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Knowledge Forum\ (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons that Web Knowledge Forum\ is a powerful medium. First, learners report their ideas and thoughts in notes; each note is represented as a formatted report, as shown in Figure 1 in the next section. When creating a new note or editing a previous note, learners can also add pictures or movies in HTML format from their private or public directories. Furthermore, they can add links by inputting note numbers. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Knowledge Forum\ adds two types of linking information on the note that are mirror images of each other: (1) references, and (2) notes that refer to the original note. The references are a hyperlinked list of notes referred to by the original note. The notes that refer to the original note are a hyperlinked list of notes that refer to the original note. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of tech&lt;br /&gt;
 an example of distributed cognition — the tech is enabling a higher level cognition by linking notes together. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, notes are reported in the space called Bview.’’ (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of views are dynamically created and refined as learning progresses. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of teacher&lt;br /&gt;
 an example of the teacher doing higher-level structuring of the  knowledge space. Are there concrete examples of students doing this? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third reason that Web Knowledge Forum\ is a powerful medium is that the administrator can easily order or arrange views, linking one with another or restructuring them. She can also create a view map on the learner’s initial log-in page. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design studies in Japanese elementary science (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participating classrooms (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science teachers in the school have been involved in our design studies, and we have developed several lesson plans (two lessons a year) through discussion before, during, and after the classroom practices (Oshima et al., 2003). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classrooms reported on in this study were a sixth-grade class for design study 1 on BAir and how things burn,’’ and a fifth-grade class for design study 2 on BHow matter dissolves.’’ There were 41 students in the sixth-grade classroom and 34 students in the fifth-grade classroom. The lesson on BAir and how things burn’’ continued for 42 class hours (one class hour is 45 min long) in about two months, and the lesson on BHow matter dissolves’’ lasted for 30 class hours in four months due to the inclusion of the winter break. The same teacher, who has more than ten years of teaching experience, was in charge of both classes. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design study 1: BAir and how things burn’’ (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elicit student ideas or opinions (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the teacher demonstrated that the dense block of newspaper does not burn (or burn very well), the students were asked what is needed for things to burn. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learning goal for the students in this lesson was collaborative theory construction through experimentation on the burning phenomenon. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan investigations (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on similarities of individual student explanations reported in the form of models (drawings) on Knowledge Forum\, students were grouped into small research teams, each of which pursued their own inquiry into the target phenomenon.1 (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conduct investigation (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each team conducted their experiment by themselves under the supervision of the main teacher. Before their experiments, students were instructed to consider what to observe and record for sharing information with other teams. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students shared their experiment reports with other teams on Knowledge Forum\ and discussed with the whole classroom how they further advanced their learning. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;students had the opportunity to compare varying explanations of the phenomenon under study, and to consider more articulate and convincing theories. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our contributions to the design of the lesson, based on our two design principles, were: (1) to use students’ explanatory models and experimental reports as conceptual artifacts centered in their science activities, and (2) to get students to engage in collaborative work on their artifacts in order to advance their collective knowledge. Thus, we designed the lesson as sequences of scientific inquiry by small research teams that frequently shared their thoughts and findings on and off line. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design study 1: Evaluations (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the access logs provided us with limited information about on-line student activities, they did give us an opportunity to gain insight on how student activities in the lesson were idea-centered. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes created by students were first categorized into ideaand factbased. When students drew models or discussed their own or others’ models in notes, the notes were categorized as idea-based. Other notes in which students reported the results of their experiments or experimental procedures were categorized as fact-based. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A t-test on the proportions of ideaand fact-based notes showed that students read significantly more fact-based notes (the mean was 20.10% with 9.05 as SD) than idea-based notes (the mean was 5.70% with 1.78 as SD; t(10) = 5.54, p &amp;lt; 0.01). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, students focused their attention on constructing their theories within their teams but did not consider their contribution to collective knowledge in the classroom. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this idea did not get the attention of the other teams. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We concluded from our analysis and observation that our design effort did not satisfy the Bcommunity knowledge,’’ ’’collective responsibility,’’ and Bsymmetric knowledge advancement’’ determinants of knowledge building even though the class could invent models and experimental reports and use them as shared conceptual artifacts. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;important recognition&lt;br /&gt;
 important to recognize some principles were not satisfied, showing challenges for implementing them. it also shows that people could start from somewhere and read other principles as long as the process is iterative. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design study 2: BHow matter dissolves’’ (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In design study 1, we set a target phenomenon for students to continuously engage with through the improvement of their explanatory models. Students engaged in their real ideas in the lesson, but the task itself was not authentic enough for them to compare or synthesize their ideas between small research teams. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participatory structure in design study 1 was not organized to support students’ engagement in collective knowledge advancement. Collective activity for students to socialize their knowledge in a more global community, e.g., from ideas within a research team to those among teams, and from ideas among teams to those in the classroom as a whole, was implemented in a quite limited part of the total learning process. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities were mainly conducted under the teacher’s supervision in classroom talk after students were given opportunities to read and comment on the reports of others in Knowledge Forum. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the log analysis showed, students were concerned with facts or findings by other teams rather than the ideas of others teams. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In design study 2, the lesson started with the teacher’s question on how students define dissolution. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elicit student ideas and opinions (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task structure applied in design study 2 was crucially different from that in design study 1. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in design study 2, we asked students to use their conceptual understanding to solve an authentic task— creating a big and beautiful aluminum crystal—and improve their conceptual models through investigation. Since they shared an articulated task goal, the different research teams were expected to engage in more collective and symmetric knowledge advancement. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exchange information from investigations (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In design study 2, we revised the activity structure as follows. First, before students shared information among different research teams on Knowledge Forum\, the teacher encouraged students to briefly report their progress in the classroom talk. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, students went back to their research teams to read and comment on the reports of others, and to discuss how they could build new ideas from the reports. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as a result of the classroom talk, the students determined that they needed a control condition in each research team to rigorously test their predictions. They collaboratively designed experiments by distributing different factors for the teams to investigate. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design study 2: Evaluation (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2 (Design Study) 2 (Note Type) ANOVA on proportions of accessed notes showed that: (1) proportions of accessed notes in design study 2 were significantly higher than those in design study 1 (F(1, 18) = 16.11, p &amp;lt; 0.01), and (2) proportions of accessed fact-based notes were significantly higher than those of accessed idea-based notes (F(1, 18) = 19.89, p &amp;lt; 0.01) (Fig. 2). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, student activities in design study 2 were more based on collective and symmetric knowledge advancement. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we infer that student activities in design study 2 were more idea-centered. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of students’ activities in team A suggests that the students constantly engaged in improving their ideas through their collaboration with other teams. Activities to systematically analyze and organize information from different investigations that were seen in team A were found in other teams as well. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been several studies on knowledge-building approaches to science education in other countries (e.g., Hakkarainen &amp;amp; Sintonen, 2002; Lee, Chan, &amp;amp; van Aalst, 2006). Hakkarainen and Sintonen (2002) proposed a new approach to define student scientific inquiry based on the interrogative model (Hintikka, 1988). They succeeded in articulating the process of student inquiry on CSILE (the former version of Knowledge Froum). Lee et al. (2006) investigated the effectiveness of knowledge-building scaffolding for assessing the progress of high school students’ scientific inquiry. They found that the portfolio guided by knowledge-building principles (Scardamalia, 2002) was a powerful tool for high-school students to elevate their level of conceptual understanding of complex scientific concepts. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of our research here was on whether we can refine the current culturally established practice of scientific inquiry by elementary-school students by inventing general but powerful design elements (the task structure and the participatory structure) with a CSCL technology. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In applying Japanese elementary science activity structures in our design studies, we developed two design principles for transforming the class structure into knowledge-building practice: (1) idea-centered lesson, and (2) collective knowledge advancement. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our observation analysis of student activities on and off line showed that students were involved in scientific inquiry with their ideas being centered in both lessons. They expressed, revisited, and revised their explanatory models through their investigations. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this emergent problem was not further pursued in their learning. We considered several reasons for students to have missed the important opportunity to deepen their conceptual understanding. One reason is that it was difficult for students to plan and conduct investigations on this issue. The teacher agreed with us that students would not have the repertoire of experimental designs in their minds even if they had been concerned with this problem. The most crucial reason, we believe, is that the worth of the concern was not collectively recognized by other students. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an asymmetric or non-collective activity structure kept students from rising above their ideas to form a new perspective. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In design study 2, knowledge advancement was more collective and symmetric than that in design study 1. One reason for such collective and symmetric knowledge advancement is the refinement of the task structure in the lesson. Students were engaged in fun and authentic problem solving (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another design element we can count on is the participatory structure we designed for sharing information from investigations by others. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found, however, that the implementation of such a new knowledge medium and preparation time for using it did not encourage students to (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of tech&lt;br /&gt;
 socio-cultural setup greatly influence use of tech. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;engage in inter-group communication. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blending of offand on-line communication for student progress helped them understand what their class as a community knew and what problems or questions remained, or which groups had similar interests and important data. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be useful for us to return to the lesson in design study 1 for considering how we can improve the overall lesson practice based on our findings in design study 2. With regard to the participatory structure, we think that we can similarly apply the blending of offand on-line communication depending on the task structure and student activity structure. We need to pay more attention to the task structure, however. Combustion itself is still a mysterious concept that requires further scientific endeavor. It is difficult for us to provide students with a task structure, based on which students themselves engage in authentic and collaborative problem solving, by explaining the scientific mechanism. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need further collaboration with scientists and curriculum designers to develop a task structure effective for studying combustion in the elementary school. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue we have to further consider is that students easily focus on task goals when they require them to do something concrete such as construct a product. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coordination of doing scientific inquiry and building knowledge through such practices should be further discussed in order to find general knowledge-building activity structures. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Literature (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fairly substantial body of literature comparing the reading of paper versus on-line documents can be found in the psychological, human factors, and ergonomics literature (see [4, 10] for comprehensive reviews). The majority of studies focus on “outcome” measures of reading, such as speed [16, 25], proof-reading accuracy [3, 8, 25], and comprehension [6, 16]. A lesser effort has been devoted to looking at “process” differences between reading on paper and reading on screen such as how readers look at text in terms of eye movements [9], how they manipulate it [21], and how they navigate through it [5]. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay Bolter, in his book “Writing Space” [2], heralded the computer as the fourth great document medium, next to the papyrus, the medieval codex, and the printed book. Implied in this is that the demise of the printed page is merely a matter of time. Certainly many of today’s hot topics in human-computer interaction point to digital alternatives to paper documents: the Web, new hypertext applications, digital libraries, and digital document ~ading devices. Some have predicted that such advances will make books as we know them obsolete, will radically alter the relationship between authors and nxxiers, and will change forever our concept of libraries as repositories of physical volumes of text, and of publishers as producers and sellers of paper books. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reality of day to day life shows that paper continues to be the preferred medium for much of our reading activity. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annotation While Reading (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subjects’ comments in both conditions indicated that annotating and note-taking while reading was important in deepening their comprehension of the text, and in helping them to form a plan for writing the summary. Essentially, it did this by drawing attention to important points and making explicit the structure between them. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-line. In the On-line condition, 4 of the subjects expressed that, had the document been on paper, their natural tendency would have been to annotate the document in some way or another. However only one of the subjects attempted to do this on-line, using a complex customisation of the tool bar to allow him to draw boxes around relevant sections of text or to draw a line down the side of the text. In doing so, this subject experienced a number of difficulties which interfered with the smooth flow of reading: (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper. The majority of subjects (4 of 5), during the fiist pass through the document, undertook some form of notetaking activity while reading. In general such markings were made quickly and interwoven with the ongoing reading. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for this kind of annotation was to provide a set of markings for later reference. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the general reluctance to annotate the document was that annotating on-line results in making changes to the original document: emboldening, italicizing or underlining all alter the original document. Subjects indicated that they wanted to regard annotations as a separate layer of the document, and felt uncomfortable not maintaining this distinction. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems, then, that note-taking separate from the source document was more appropriate with these on-line tools. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the very act of making such marks is a process which aids understanding and facilitates the building of an internal representation of the text. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes written separately were also used as a resource for later reference, (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three major differences between conditions were noted (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Annotation on paper was relatively effortless and smoothly integrated with reading compared to on-line annotation which was cumbersome and detracted from the reading task. (2) Paper supported annotation of the source document itself which many subjects felt was important. The Online condition did not provide enough flexibility to d this, nor did it support the richness and variation of annotations on paper. In addition, subjects were (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reluctant to tarnper with the original text and wanted their marks perceptually distinct from the original document. (3) Subjects in both conditions also took notes on separate documents. Note-taking in the Paper condition was fkquent and was interleaved with reading. In the Online condition, reading was interspersed with long periods of editing, or note-taking was done after twiding with little reference back to the source document. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movement Within and Betwaen Documents (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-line. In the On-line condition, whether scrolling or paging through the document, navigation was found to be irritatingly slow and distracting (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature which limited quick movement was the fact that one handed input meant that navigation activities had to be performed serially with other activities. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper. A40vement through paper documents was characterised by its speed and automaticity. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary. Movement through documents in both conditions was found to be important for information organisation, for reference, and for checking understanding. However, there were four ways in which this movement diffenxl: (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Navigation through paper was quick, automatic, and interwoven with reading. In the On-line condition it was slow, laborious, and detracted from reading. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Two handed movement through paper allowed midem to interleave and overlap navigation with other activities, (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Subjects reading from paper used its tactile qualities to support navigation and to implicitly assess document length. Subjects in the On-line condition failed to make use of explicit cues such as page length to assess document length. (4) The fixity of information with respect to physical paper pages supported incidental memory for where things were, which in turn supported search and Rreading activities. The inability to see a complete page may undermine use of this feature on-line, but it appears pictures were used as anchor points. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spatial Layout (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;restrictions on field of view for on-line documents meant that subjects either lost resolution through shrinking the documents, or had to use overlapping windows. (2) The layout of paper documents was flexible and dynamic, providing quick access for cross-referencing, and supporting the juxtaposition of documents for reading and writing. In the On-line condition, subjects had to plan in advance how to position and size the windows in anticipation of their future requirements. (3) Paper supported the use of independent reading and writing spaces which could be accessed concurrently and manipulated independently. Because only one window could accept input at a time, subjects in the on-line condition experienced difficulties integrating reading and writing. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION AND DESIGN IMPLICATIONS (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the support of reading, and more specifically in support of reading for the pu~ose of writing, this study has shown that the benefits of paper far outweigh those of on-line tools. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, the critical differences have to do with the major advantages that paper offers in supporting annotation while reading, quick navigation, and flexibility of spatial layout. These, in turn, allow readers to deepen their understanding of the text, extract a sense of its structure, plan for writing, cross-refer to other documents, and interleave reading and writing. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;extract (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognise that annotation can be an integral part of reading and build support for these processes. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary. Laying out pages in space was found to important for gaining an overall sense of the structure of a document, for referring to other documents, and for integrating reading with writing. There were three main differences in the two conditions: (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Laying out paper in space allowed the visualization of a great deal of information, and provided a holding space for quick reference to other documents. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to support more flexibility and control in spatial layout. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to support quicker, more effortless navigation techniques. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can begin to unravel the complexity of the design challenge, and begin to make some better informed predictions about when and if we can ever expect a paperless future. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the literacy development of 4-year-old children in a laboratory school (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year, children participated in a longitudinal photo journal project. With adult support, children posted their photo journals and ideas to KF® in the form of electronic “notes,” which allowed children to view each other’s work and to build on ideas by posting their responses and comments. A comparison group employed a paper-only format to write notes about their photos. Results showed that children were motivated to read others’ notes and to respond using invented spelling. There were gender differences in the number of notes posted. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also know that young children can profit from specific competencies that are developed through familiarity with computer technology (Calvert, Rideout, Woolard, Barr, &amp;amp; Strousse, 2005; Haugland, 1992). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some child advocates, however, are concerned that technology may be misused in early childhood classrooms, causing children to become bored or to experience actual decline in literacy learning (Lankshear &amp;amp; Knobel, 2002). Still others caution that introducing children to computer technology at a very young age may cause a decline in children’s imaginative play (Christensen &amp;amp; Kelly, 2003; Miller, 2005). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In referring to computer technology, we must go beyond just “having computers in the classroom” (Cohen, 2005) or using computers as a “benign addition” to the curriculum (Plowman &amp;amp; Stephen, 2003). Rather, we must begin using technology in innovative ways such as telecommunication exchanges among young children (Cohen, 2005) and the development of new literacies, such as the use of online tools, for the knowledge generation (Wood, 2004). These new literacies range from multimedia, interactive Web sites, information and communication technologies or digital literacy (Plowman &amp;amp; Stephen, 2003), to recording theories and connecting children’s ideas so that the product becomes new knowledge (Hewitt &amp;amp; Scardamalia, 1998). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willett (2005) cautions us about oversimplifying both (i.e., children’s facility or lack of facility) of these positions. Facer et al. suggest that there is no evidence that children are natural born experts vis-à-vis computer technology and claim that adults and children have different strengths when it concerns computers. Children may more readily access information and fashion artifacts, but adults have better judgment about the validity and usefulness of information that is obtained through this medium. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these points are well-taken, this article is less concerned with children’s use of programs and information accessed on computers and is more concerned with children’s use of computers as a shared “headspace,” a forum for depositing and reworking ideas in a sustained and creative way. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHAT IS KNOWLEDGE BUILDING? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KNOWLEDGE BUILDING AND SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIVISM IN EARLY CHILDHOOD (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle of knowledge building in early childhood does not differ from knowledge building in later childhood; that is, more sophisticated understandings about what is learned and how it is learned are “built” as children ask and answer authentic questions on a shared computer database. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of the teacher is critical in supporting, “scaffolding,” or helping children “build” thinking through language (Vygotsky, 1962). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teacher&amp;rsquo;s role (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers’ goals are to create a learning environment that allows for discussion and shared understanding. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers and peers operate within what Vygotsky (1978) termed the zone of proximal development (ZPD), allowing the learner to be supported to understand more than he or she would on his or her own. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KNOWLEDGE FORUM®: TECHNOLOGY FOR KNOWLEDGE BUILDING (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers have observed that motivation is heightened when the creation of each view comes from student suggestions during class meetings (Reeve, Halewood, &amp;amp; Pelletier, 2004). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;student agency (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KNOWLEDGE FORUM® AND PHOTO JOURNALS IN KINDERGARTEN (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impetus for this study was a photo journal project taking place in the kindergarten class at the ICS Laboratory School in Toronto. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent was to promote children’s writing in the context of reflecting about their own experiences, because children are more inclined to write about what is familiar to them (Haneda &amp;amp; Wells, 2000). The photographs also provided a way to include parents in the school experience, as young children do not always share what happens in a day with their parents. To that end, photo journals provide both documentation of writing and a record of what happens in a day. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the goal for the project remained the same: to promote early literacy in a way that was both meaningful and developmentally appropriate for young children. It is noteworthy that literacy is naturally associated with reading and writing skills that are taught in school; yet as Plowman and Stephen (2003) noted, traditional literacy skills may not be directly transferable to or from computer technology. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Figure 1, four photographs are shown as examples of the experiences children wanted to put on the database as they first began their work on KF®. Taking the playground photograph as an example, children opened the database to the playground photograph and either posted a note about their own experience or else read (had read to them) the note of another child in the class and added on to the classmate’s note. Other children could in turn add on so that a large set of ideas was built about a playground question. Children were discussing a design for an ideal playground because the schoolyard was undergoing a renovation (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pervasive KB, agency&lt;br /&gt;
 it is interesting to see how children built from photo sharing to considering building an ideal playground. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH QUESTION (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we wanted to use the same measures used in the school-wide reading study to examine whether the KF® technology would provide a particular context for literacy development that differed from regular “print” reading and writing and whether it might be more motivating for the children. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related question was based on the ICS teachers’ observations of boys and girls in the class. Boys, who in general were less likely to voluntarily take part in literacy activities in their play and free time activity, appeared to be interested in looking at what other children had written, and in writing on the KF® database. Given the boys’ preference for nonliteracy activity in class, the question of gender difference was explored in the research study. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were interested to know whether knowledge building using photographs and classmates’ ideas might appeal to boys and whether they might make as many entries as girls on the database. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METHODS (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Hill and Nichols (2006) explained, there are changing theoretical perspectives in understanding emergent literacy, ranging from maturationist to emergent, to social constructivist, to critical perspectives, and it is important to draw from this wide range of perspectives. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter draws on social constructivist theory but acknowledges the necessity of employing empiricist methods to answer specific questions related to change in children’s literacy development. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this chapter is limited to a report of the precomparison and postcomparison regarding literacy development of children in the KF® class and children in a regular class without KF®. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Child participants included twenty-two 4-year-old children in a full-day program from the ICS Laboratory School at the University of Toronto (mean age 52.1 months). A comparison group of twenty 5-year-old children from the Laboratory School at a top-ranked university in the United States (USLS–U.S. Laboratory School; mean age 63.4 months) employed the same measures to examine literacy development among the children who were using paper and pencil photo journals. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children in both schools had access to computers and other forms of technology in the home. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers were White and middle class, both with significant experience teaching kindergarten in a private university laboratory school. Both teachers were connected to and interested in classroom research. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procedures (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The children and teachers took photographs of events in the class, and, in some cases, brought in pertinent photographs from home. This part of the photo journal project engaged children through group discussion and actual taking of the photographs in the class. Teachers began the project by bringing in photographs of meaningful places or events in their own lives, and, by sharing those with the children, gave the children a sense of the purpose of the project. The children quickly grasped the idea of documenting their ideas through photographs. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KF® photographs were scanned from hard copy or were entered electronically depending on the source of the photograph. At USLS, photographs were pasted into the children’s journals; children then wrote journal entries about the photographs, using regular pencils or markers. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, children had access to their electronic journals during their free activity periods in both the morning and the afternoon. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children chose to go to the computer voluntarily, or were encouraged by an adult if they had not gone there for a few days. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early literacy measures included a standardized early reading test and a developmental writing task. The Test of Early Reading Ability–2 (TERA–2; Reid, Hresko, &amp;amp; Hammill, 1989) measures early reading in children between the ages of 3 years, 6 months and 8 years, 6 months. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we now use the TERA–3 (Reid, Hresko, &amp;amp; Hammill, 2001) in research (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developmental writing task measures English language children’s early writing development along a continuum and provides insight into children’s emerging ability to use letters to represent sounds in contrast to using letters to represent objects (Pelletier, 2002; Pelletier &amp;amp; Lasenby, in press). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the pre-assessments and postassessments, children’s entries in either the KF® database or in the paper journals were counted to provide a quantitative account of writing. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESULTS (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Figure 2 shows a photograph of a science experiment that Heather carried out with the help of an adult (the “pink eruption”). Heather posted a note about her experiment and other children contributed their ideas about the “eruption” (see Figure 2). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to Early Literacy (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many children were motivated to make entries themselves using whatever strategies they had available, including use of invented spelling. That is, children’s authentic purpose in contributing ideas to the database required use of written communication. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they applied their literacy learning toward the goal of building knowledge about science, about the school playground, about mathematical constructions, and about many other natural experiences that were a regular part of classroom life. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus literacy was used authentically in the pursuit of knowledge building. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results for Early Reading (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of the posttest scores on the TERA–2 showed that children in both classes made impressive gains in reading, actually showing increases in reading quotients. Of note was that the ICS children who used KF® had even higher standard scores at posttest than the USLS children who used the paper format alone (ICS Mean standard score = 128.2; USLS Mean standard score = 117.2). The difference between the two classes in change in standard reading scores from pretest to posttest represents a significant difference (p &amp;lt; .05; see Figure 4). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results for Early Writing (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scoring system captures the developmental transition in early writing from scribble, to drawing, to letter-like forms, to alphabetic writing, and includes children’s representation of number (Pelletier &amp;amp; Lasenby, in press). For example, when children are asked to write “two horses”, a drawing of two horses receives a score of 1 for the representation of number (i.e., 2), and a score of 3 for drawing that resembles the object (see Figure 5). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As children develop, writing increasingly employs conventional letters and phonetic principles. Using the “two horses” example, if a child wrote “2 hors,” she received a score of 2 for representing the correct number in numeral format and a score of 11 for phonological spelling even when some words may not be com- (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pletely correctly spelled (see Figure 6). The scoring system for the writing component ranges from 0 to 12. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The children at USLS had higher scores on the early writing task at pretest than the ICS children. They likewise had higher scores at posttest. However, if we examine the change in writing over time, the ICS children had greater gain scores in early writing development; the difference in gain scores in writing did not reach statistical significance with this small number of participants (see Table 1). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender Differences in Reading (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the pretest and posttest reading scores revealed that girls’ scores were significantly higher at both time points (p &amp;lt; .05; see Table 2). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender Differences in Writing (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of children’s performance at pretests and posttests on the developmental writing task showed that girls were further along the developmental writing continuum than boys, but this difference was not significant. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative Differences in the Knowledge Forum® and Paper Journal (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all boys and girls in both contexts, girls made more entries in the paper format of the photo journals than they did in the KF®format. That is, girls appeared to use the paper format more than the electronic format. Girls made more entries than boys in the paper format; that is, boys did not seem to use the paper format as often as did girls. However, when boys’ and girls’ entries were compared on the paper journals and KF®, boys made the same number of entries as girls on the KF® database. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the electronic format may have been more motivating for boys and prompted them to do more writing (see Figure 8). (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique feature of KF® technology is that children view each others’ ideas, posted as electronic notes, and build on to those ideas by linking to another’s note and adding their theories to the database. This knowledge building environment, from a social constructivist perspective, puts ideas, in contrast to activities, at the center of children’s experiences at school (Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 2003a). (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;role of technology (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, rather than taking part in literacy activities that require drill and rehearsal, children used their emerging literacy skills to develop ideas and to form concepts. The shared virtual space enables children to construct an understanding of own and other, to see how individual ideas are brought to bear on the collective. This notion of socially constructed computer experience that addresses issues related to self and other has been considered from a transactional perspective in an ethnographic study of children in a Grade 1 classroom (Wang &amp;amp; Ching, 2003). (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for Technology in the School (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important consideration in making this form of technology use successful in an early childhood environment is the level of support in the school and in the class. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher training and follow-up support have also been associated with effective technology implementation (Epstein, 1993). In keeping with Carroll’s (2001) findings, in the study reported here, the teacher’s beliefs and training and the level of school support in the KF® school were consistent with a positive philosophy and goal-orientation vis-à-vis knowledge building with computer technology. Thus, results achieved in this context may not be replicable in a less supportive environment. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do Children Learn Literacy From Technology in Kindergarten? (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results of the analyses revealed that children who participated in the KF® learning environment made greater gains in early reading over the course of the year. They also made greater gains in early writing development, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other research reports are consistent with our findings that children appear to benefit from high quality computer technology. For example, Haugland (1992) has shown that children who use computers as part of their early childhood program have significantly greater developmental gains in knowledge, skills, and dexterity than children without this experience. Similarly a qualitative study carried out in six southern California school districts reported that kindergarten students who used the Writing to Read computer program achieved at least two grade levels higher than similar classes of kindergarten students who did not use this technology (Casey, 2001). (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender Differences (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important finding was that although girls made more entries in the paper journals than they did in the electronic format and made more entries than boys, both boys and girls made a similar number of entries on the KF® database. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implications of the Study (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children benefit from the shared knowledge building environment in a number of ways. Conceptual knowledge is “constructed” in an authentic social–constructivist fashion (Vygotsky, 1978). Children become the holders not only of their own theories, but also of those of the group. The database allows them to view theory construction and to have the written archives as “objects of reflection” and further inquiry (Olson, 1994). Literacy learning is fundamental to engaging with this technology, but is also a beneficial by-product. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @davis2001&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis, D. (2001). Ph .D. Thesis Research: Where do I Start? Retrieved from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.columbia.edu/~drd28/Thesis&#34;&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/~drd28/Thesis&lt;/a&gt; Research.pdf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is very important&amp;ndash;maybe the most helpful one in terms of articulating promisingness in looking for thesis topic. It centers around some points such as being interesting, important, and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-how-do-i-find-the-right-topic&#34;&gt;1. How Do I Find “The Right Topic”?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, there is no “Right Topic.” &amp;ndash;Much more important is to find something that is important and genuinely interests you. You need to settle on an area where you are sufficiently interested that you don’t mind making some investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work on important topics (Note: This is not an incitement to work on broad, vague topics!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-how-do-i-know-if-i-have-an-interesting-topic&#34;&gt;2. How do I know if I have an interesting topic?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“interesting” inevitably has a subjective, aesthetic component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so identify interestingness based on useful indicators: (1) good minds have spent time thinking about it; (2) one with a real world counterpart of some significant magnitude; (3) new&amp;ndash;paid by your marginal product;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skeptic of a research topic: “Why should I care?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has some substantive real-world counterpart; real-world examples can be influential and magnitudes matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be as concrete as possible in explaining both the type of problem to which this applies and what the magnitude of the problem is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you know if what you are doing is new? (1) read the entire history of the literature&amp;ndash;not efficient; (2) talk to someone actually working in the area + look at recent surveys of the literature or recent working papers + use library index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New + Important: you are working on an important problem with real-world counterparts and that matter in substantive terms, and moreover that your approach to the problem is new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;convince readers that the novel element in your paper is in fact important; after reading your paper, researchers familiar with the literature in your area should see the world differently.
&amp;ndash;After reading your study, will the leading researchers in the field be forced to look at the area in a way differently than they did before and in a way that matters substantively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;the results have to be convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should choose a topic that is demonstrably important, that has elements which are themselves new and important, and the resulting study should be both reasonable and convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-where-do-i-start-strategies-for-research&#34;&gt;3. Where do I start? Strategies for Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Research Frontier”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is often a set of questions that the leaders in the field are currently struggling with and may be very far from having definitive answers. Being able to weigh in on these problems with a new insight (and avoid dead topics) is an important step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weekly departmental seminars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seminars of potential new assistant professors at your school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working papers of the intellectual leaders in your narrowly focused research area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the best journals selectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interaction with your professors and your fellow students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question Authority!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your advisor is too nice!&amp;ndash;to ask your advisors to be as frank and critical as they are able when reviewing your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writign matters; publish jointly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presentation matters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-inspiration-is-where-you-find-it&#34;&gt;4. Inspiration is where you find it.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, there can be no rules for finding a thesis topic, since it can’t be mechanical. Much depends on your creativity and inspiration, your insightfulness and energy. A bit of magic is required.
How do you create your own magic? Some people say their best ideas come when they are in the shower, or playing raquetball, or &amp;hellip; . I’m not sure the answer is that I should direct you to take lots of showers! You have to find your own muse. Success and failure, in the end, are in your hands only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Phillips2014-jd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phillips, D. C. (2014). Research in the hard sciences, and in very hard “softer” domains. Educational Researcher . Retrieved from &lt;a href=&#34;http://edr.sagepub.com/content/43/1/9.short&#34;&gt;http://edr.sagepub.com/content/43/1/9.short&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the work of Popper and Dewey, this commentary highlights the relative similarities between hard sciences and education research in their rhetorical nature, while acknowledging the divergent paths of these two fields of inquiry with regard to prediction and generalizability. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;given the highly contextualized nature of educational processes, embedded in shifting complex social settings, and the relevance of all variables, very little education research is able to pursue predictive power. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;physics envy (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the hypothetico-deductive method (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the course of doing this work, we face great difficulties—epistemological, methodological, and practical, lib- erally seasoned from time to time by the economic hardship of underfunding and by uninformed interference by governmental agencies issuing ideologically based methodological strictures. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dewey even made the point that Popper became famous for can- vassing (although Popper probably does deserve the credit as he made it in an extremely powerful way)—namely, researchers must ensure that they do not focus their efforts on proving that (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is moot because (with an important proviso) all competent inquiries (to use John Dewey’s [1938] felicitous expression from Logic: The Theory of Inquiry) have the same fea- tures. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they are right; they must not, in the terminology sometimes used in the educational methodology literature, adopt a “confirma- tory orientation.” Popper argued that it always is possible to find some evidence that one’s favored hypothesis is right, but this counts for little—what is crucial is that one attempts to find evidence that it is wrong. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue here, of course, concerns predictive power, or—what is a closely related, if not exactly the same, thing—the issue of generalizability of the findings of a research study. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some very fine pieces of education research aim to achieve in- depth understanding of a single, specific context of educational significance, with all of its relevant particular, individualizing features taken into account. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;owever, rarely if ever do researchers operating in this mode aspire to make predictions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hard physical sciences, confounding variables can eventually be controlled, but in research in educational set- tings, these factors are not nuisances but are of great human and educational significance—control here removes all sem- blance of ecological validity. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;s all being attempts to make a compelling case one way or the other. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;differ- ences between the fields (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the feature that has been most responsible for the astounding progress of the physical sciences over the past few centuries is its ability to put its hypotheses (and the cases that were made to support them) to the test, by making precise predictions that can then be subjected to empirical verification or refutation. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soft field of educa- tion research is held by many to fare poorly here, for the mak- ing of precise predictions is vanishingly rare, (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the problem is that in education, just about all the variables are relevant, and controlling them (even if possible let alone desirable) yields (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;results that are difficult or impossible to generalize to the other almost infinite number of settings where these variables do, indeed, vary. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Porcaro2014&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porcaro, D. S. (2014). Educational change in Oman: a design research study of personal, institutional, and societal reactions to collaborative knowledge building. Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 23(2), 199–223. doi:10.1080/1475939X.2013.802993&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reading this article when reviewing literature on knowledge building. However, knowledge building is not a central concept in this article as its general sense is applied here. Maybe constructivist collaborative learning is the general approach here. What&amp;rsquo;s relevant is FLE4 is applied in this study. What&amp;rsquo;s very interesting is that when introducing an educational innovation to one culture, there are so many different things that come into play to determine whether this innovation would be successful. This applies in knowledge building as well as documented in efforts introducing it to Hong Kong, mainland China, etc. This article would be suitable to be included in review on KB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students were responsible for gaining expertise in some aspect of their role through independent research and sharing that expertise with their group to collaboratively build multimedia kits relevant to the local Omani context. During the task, students formed knowledge-building communities of their own using Moodle as well as FLE4, an open source plugin for WordPress blogs (see Muukkonen, Hakkarainen, &amp;amp; Lakkala, 1999) which is based on the framework of Knowledge Forum (Scardamalia &amp;amp; Bereiter, 1993, 1996). Students’ collaborative work was conducted online, so that mixed-gender groups could collaborate. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address my research questions, I employed a variety of research methods to understand the ways institutional structures and students’ educational philosophies affected the introduction of innovative curricula (see Table 1). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own cultural background is not rooted in Arabic language traditions, Islamic religious traditions, or Middle Eastern ethnic traditions. The closest I can claim is my Sicilian family heritage, since as the Sicilian proverb runs, ‘Scratch the skin of a Sicilian and you will find an Arab.’ Though my cultural worldview has been shaped by my upbringing in the United States, and educational training in the United States and England, I have long studied the history, languages, culture, and religions of the Middle East, and have lived and travelled in many different Arabic-speaking countries. I recognise my limitations in this setting as a cultural ‘outsider’, and turn often to many ‘cultural translators’ for help interpreting and making meaning of my own observations. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings: Omani culture’s effects on collaboration (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article focuses entirely on one of these factors, culture, and the many ways the culture of the teacher and student affected the adoption of CSCL. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oral culture in Oman (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where culture was most present in learning was in students’ preference for oral traditions of learning. An Omani faculty member suggested that students in Oman preferred discussing rather than reading, learning by speaking rather than writing. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;challenges&lt;br /&gt;
 this could be a challenge for KB and CSCL for sure. Interesting that these factors have been less reported in the literature. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical setting of the class (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a Westerner, the most noticeable aspect of many SQU classrooms is the separate entrances for males and females. Male students come from inside the building and enter the first two or three rows of seats, and female students enter from the outside (women only) corridor and sit on the back two or three rows of seats. There are often two or three rows of empty seats between them. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher–student relationship (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, in the Qur’anic schools the teacher represented the absolute authority in the classroom. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changing role of the teacher and student in Omani society has produced a range of reactions in faculty and students. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some students and faculty have welcomed this new-found student freedom, others feared the lack of control in the classroom. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distance between student and teacher is highlighted well in Eickelman’s (2002) review of traditional religious education in Oman. He noticed that there was much quiet memorisation, while questioning was rare and corporal punishment was common. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hall (2009) suggests that due to the strong role of the teacher and the hierarchical role of the class, constructivist learning in Oman should begin teacher-centred and progress to more learner-centred. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omani society has clearly defined views on women in society and the interactions between men and women. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views of the role of women also reflect the ways women interact and collaborate in the classroom. For the students, there were varied and conflicting expectations for the voice of women in the classroom. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another female student confided with me that she was afraid to ask questions in class if a male answered. While this was not true of all female students, in fact several female students were quite vocal in class, for many students, the cultural norms for women in society placed restrictions on their ability to discuss, collaborate, or present ideas in the class (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gender restriction in some cultures&lt;br /&gt;
 interesting that such reality exists in some cultures. it totally runs against KB and many western approaches. how to deal with them?&lt;br /&gt;
 it reminds me of introducing KB to China. even though there was less restrictions on gender, cultural dynamics like this are common. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical separation between males and females also affected the way students were able to participate outside class. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both male and female students noted that because the female students lived close to each other they were able to collaborate more often outside class, which often led to better-quality collaborative projects. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course under study, the differences between male and female students often manifest themselves through higher technical interest and ability of the male students, while the female students generally demonstrated more focused collaboration and problem-solving, creativity in applying theories to their projects, attention to detail in design, and quality in presentation of materials. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration-based classroom, however, the societal limitations of male–female collaboration were a strong concern to the students. When asked if the students felt that culture affected their ability to succeed in the class, this male–female interaction was mentioned 42 times – 37 of those times the students stated they could not work with students of the opposite gender. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many faculty and students pointed to various reasons for the separation between male and female students, including cultural, governmental, religious, and social. This is similar to the declaration of Al-Lamki (1999) that gender differences in Oman were social and not religious. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the students in my study, however, agreed that online collaboration provided a place for them to share ideas in a socially safe space. Similarly, Khan (2006) found that computer-mediated communication lessened the male-dominant role of face-to-face communication and empowered women in the class discussions. This idea was confirmed by students who used the CSCL environment in this study. One male faculty member suggested that ‘the online kind of tools will even break, to a great extent, this separation between genders’. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One faculty member noted they often used online tools to invite male–female discussions on academic topics, something he felt was not possible in the classroom. This confirms the feelings of Jordanian and Emirati educators and students who felt that the ‘barriers’ between the genders were lowered online (Tubaishat, Bhatti, &amp;amp; El-Qawasmeh, 2006). (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural beliefs toward technology (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some students were less optimistic, and realised that some aspects of technology did not conform to Omani culture. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the idea of ‘misusing’ technology was a concern in the schools as well as within the home and needed to be controlled by parents and teachers, just as the internet was controlled by the government. For most Omani students and faculty, the most important aspect of technology was that it be used within the cultural traditions of Omani society. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to indirectly affecting the separation of genders noted above, religion had an impact on the way students accepted collaborative learning. For example, one student noted that the idea of collaboration was a religious value. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While students realised that religion played an important part in their education, they felt that religion would not stand in the way of their learning. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, religion played a role in how students connected their collaborative work in the course with future skills they would need in the workforce. In Islamic culture, the idea of ‘Inshallah’ or ‘if God wills it’ is engrained into the mind-set of the students. It is not only a part of every conversation, but shapes how the students foresee the future. When asked what the students planned to do after graduation, most could not articulate a clear plan or direction. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although foundational to Omani society, the results did not necessarily show religion playing a major overt role in students’ adoption of collaborative learning per se. However, it did have indirect influence on other aspects, such as gender, adoption of technology, and classroom layout, as noted above, as well as how Omanis viewed collaboration in general. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration in Omani society (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of collaborating is not new to Omani society. Many of the students and faculty mentioned that co-operation and collaboration were hallmarks of Omani society. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in many ways Omani culture is communal and collaborative, as Hall (2010) highlighted. It was on this idea that she built her design principles for social constructivist learning in Oman. But in other ways Oman society is competitive and individualistic, as noted above. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea also highlights the role of the family in Omani society and how the family, not the individual, is the basic unit of society. Students often talked about families, rather than individuals, making decisions about culture in their lives, such as technology use. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Omani society is fashioned on building relationships and appearing kind and agreeable. When students were in situations where their ideas disagreed, they often found that building the relationship was more important than refining an idea. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was further manifest in students not feeling comfortable providing critical feedback, especially to the teacher. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaction to cultural elements (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was conflict between teacher, student, or institution, the conflict may have been dismissed and the student or teacher continued to hold on to their cultural beliefs, often complaining about their instructor, or the institution in the process. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student adaptation (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where students had to make the largest change for themselves was their cultural understanding of the teacher–student relationship. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students slowly changed their understanding of the teacher’s role in the classroom, eventually limiting their use of honorific titles that were common in Arabic culture, for more peer-based ones. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, as students adapted to my own cultural expectations of the role of the teacher and student in the classroom, they found themselves more comfortable with the new learning environment. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher adaptation (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my expectations of the students (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, underlying all these issues was the cultural preference for oral over textual learning. Try as I could to introduce the Western concept of ‘term paper’ to my students, the necessary alignment between educational philosophies was not there. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus I was forced to adapt my expectations for these students in terms of reading and writing for class. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course adaptation (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: cultural adaptations (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 5. Principles for designing for culture in Omani higher education. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most obvious cultural influences on CSCL adoption was gender, since many felt male–female collaboration was not appropriate. However, the use of online communication platforms showed that the computer-support element of CSCL could play an important role in fostering collaboration in Oman. In terms of cultural acceptance of technology, students accepted the role of technology, including online communication, as long as it benefits Omani society. Religion was one area that on the surface separated the students from me as the teacher, but had the least impact on the adoption of CSCL. As long as the values of Islam were recognised and accommodated for, the congruence between students and me was ignored. Lastly, the role of collaboration in society meant that students were well prepared to discuss, argue, and work together in learning as they do in society. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @kloftpredicting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kloft, M., Stiehler, F., Zheng, Z., and Pinkwart, N. (2014). Predicting mooc dropout over weeks using machine learning methods. In Modeling Large Scale Social Interaction in Massively Open Online Courses Workshop (EMNLP 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potentially useful paper. The element of using historical features to predict dropouts is useful. It also built and tested a number of features for predicting dropouts. But the value of predicting dropouts in later weeks of a MOOC is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this problem is partially solved for students that are active in online forums, this is not yet the case for the more general student population. In this paper, we present an approach that works on click-stream data. Among other features, the machine learning algorithm takes the weekly history of student data into account and thus is able to notice changes in student behavior over time. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or instance, a linguistic analysis of the MOOC forum data can discover valuable indicators for predicting dropout of students (Wen et al., 2014). However, only few MOOC students (roughly 5-10%) use the discussion forums (Rose and Siemens, 2014), so that dropout predictors for the remaining 90% would be desirable. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we propose a machine learning method based on support vector machines for predicting dropout between MOOC course weeks in this paper. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dataset we used in this paper was prepared for the shared task launched by the Modeling Large Scale Social Interaction in Massively Open Online Courses Workshop at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the online data provided by Jordan (2014), most MOOCs have completion rates of less than 13%. (EMNLP 2014) (Rose and Siemens, 2014). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data was collected from a psychology MOOC course which was launched in March 2013. The whole course lasted for 12 weeks with 11,607 participants in the beginning week and 3,861 participants staying until the last course week. Overall, 20,828 students participated, with approximately 81.4% lost at last. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the post-processing the data consists of lists of attributes each correlated to a unique tuple consisting of the Coursera ID and the course week number. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1 Attributes description (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our model is an attempt to predict the participants’ drop-out during the next week (defined as no activity in that week and in any future week) using the data of the current and past weeks. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete attributes list is shown in Table 1. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each line the corresponding Coursera ID is taken from the database (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Methodology &amp;amp; Results (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each week i of the course, this results in a matrix X preliminary ∈ R19×ni , i the rows and columns of which correspond to the features and user ids, respectively. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New note&lt;br /&gt;
 not terribly clear about PCA here. Not sure why this is done. I was also left to guess that it was done on students.&lt;br /&gt;
 SVM is not clear either to me. What data was used to predict the results here?? This part is really confusing. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCA (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot indicates that the users that have dropped out can be better separated from the users that did not drop out when the week id increases. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Box plots of these features showed that the distribution is highly skewed and non-normal, and furthermore all features are non-negative. We thus tried two standard features transformations: 1. logarithmic transformation 2. box-cox transformation. Subsequent box plots indicated that both lead to fairly non-skewed distributions. The logarithmic transformation is however much faster and lead to better results in later pipeline steps, which is why it was taken for the remaining experiments. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, all features were centered and normalized to unit standard deviation. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we have made superior experiences with the Fisher score, which is why we focus on this approach in the following methodology. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ote that we found it beneficial to use the “history” features, that is the information about the previous weeks only within the weeks 1–12. For the weeks 13–19 we switched the history features off (also the PCA above is computed without the history features). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the video features (id 11–15), the most common request time (id 17), and the most active day feature (id 19) consistently achieved scores very close to zero, which is why they were discarded. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful&lt;br /&gt;
 Knowing some features are useful and some are not is very useful for future studies. However, we should be clear that these features were unuseful for this specific study but not for others probably. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New note&lt;br /&gt;
 Historical features are useful for predicting. This is useful to know. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that features related to a more balanced behaviour pattern over the course of a week (especially the number of sessions and number of active days) were (weakly) predictive of dropout in the beginning of the course. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;heart of our approach lies the extraction of numerical features capturing the activity level of users (e.g., number of requests) as well technical features (e.g., number of screen pixels in the employed device/computer). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found the prediction is better at the end of the course, while at the beginning we still detect rather weak signals. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article reports a reconstruction of the widely used Education Participation Scale (EPS) created by Boshier in 1970s. The &amp;lsquo;newly&amp;rsquo; created EPS, i.e., EPS (A form) in contrast with EPS (F form), is composed of a total of 42 items in 7 dimensions below (with each dimension having 6 items):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educational preparation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the study is to analyse whether elementary school children, collaborating within a computer-supported classroom, may profitably participate in research-like processes of inquiry that characterize practices of scientific research. The problem addressed in the study is whether 10-year-old and 11-year-old children, in appropriate circumstances, engage in working with knowledge at a deep level of explanation instead of processing only factual and descriptive knowledge. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the concept of ‘progressive inquiry’ to refer to the sustained processes of advancing and building of knowledge characteristic of scientific inquiry (Hakkarainen 1998, Hakkarainen and Sintonen 2002). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem addressed in the present study is whether CSILE students are profitably able to profitably engage, even in a rudimentary form, in an explanationdriven process of inquiry. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study material represents productions of 28 Grade 5/Grade 6 students over an academic year at an inner-city public school in Toronto, Canada. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was a part of pedagogical design experiment that focuses on putting ideas generated by the students themselves into the foci of education (Scardamalia 1999). Accordingly, it focuses on analysing the students’ externalized conceptions posted to CSILE’s database. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE students’ productions (research questions, intuitive and scientific explanations, written comments) were analysed at multiple levels using qualitative content analysis (see Chi 1997). The participants’ postings to CSILE’s database were partitioned into ideas—corresponding elements of progressive inquiry, such as questions, working theories, (authoritative) scientific information—in order to increase reliability of classification. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the epistemological nature of the students’ research questions was analysed by classifying each research question according to whether it was fact-seeking or explanation-seeking in nature. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students produced a series of written comments that were analysed according to the object of comment; that is, what aspect of inquiry (problem, method, information, explanation, or other) the comment was about. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative classification of CSILE students’ explanations (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of intuitive explanation (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE students produced a large number of intuitive working theories in their study projects. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the students went beyond their initial functional explanations and moved towards physical explanations in the course of their inquiry, regardless of the projects. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During their process of inquiry many CSILE students found explanatory scientific information in the Force, Cosmology, and Electricity projects as indicated by the degree of deepening explanation (table 3). These distributions provide a conservative estimate of deepening of CSILE students’ explanations because they were based on evaluation of individual students’ explanations. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSILE students’ conceptual advancement (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 35% (f = 258) out of the questions were given by the teacher to pre-structure students’ inquiry, while the (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources of conceptual advancement (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was noticed that, within each topic, the students answered their principal questions (e.g. what is gravity?) by generating a series of subordinate questions. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, CSILE students’ peer interaction appeared to contribute significantly to their conceptual advancement. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses reported elsewhere revealed that CSILE students’ written comments in general, and requests of explication of explanation embedded in these comments, were associated with their conceptual advancement (Hakkarainen 1998). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, comparisons between intuitive and scientific theories appeared to be an important source of the conceptual advancement for students. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;others (65%, f = 478) were generated by the students themselves. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis indicated that the students genuinely engaged in inquiry demonstrating an impressive degree of epistemic agency (Scardamalia 2002). They systematically generated their own intuitive theories and searched for explanatory scientific information to answer their research questions. Thus, the results furnished evidence, within specific topic areas, that children in appropriate conditions are indeed able to go beyond the surface-level phenomena through generating explanations. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course of the study projects, however, some of the participating students went beyond their intuitive conceptions and adopted very advanced scientific explanations, provided that an understandable scientific explanation was available. Although a number of students were able to overcome the functional and empirical approaches in their intuitive conceptions, only a few students were able to arrive at well-articulated theoretical-physical explanations of the problems being investigated. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the present study indicate that science educators may achieve good results from guiding their students to work systematically to develop their own (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This secondary data analysis examined a set of social interaction (e.g., social network patterns), content (e.g., questions, ideas), and lexical measures (e.g., academic words, domain terms) (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choices of research measures for a given study are often made based on theoretical considerations of what such measures mean and imply. There is a need to examine and justify the importance of these measures to collaborative knowledge building through systematic empirical testing, which will further provide a stronger research base for initiatives to create automated analysis tools (e.g., Rosé et al., 2008). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three types of quantified measures have been widely used: (a) Content analysis (Chi, 1997), using coding schemes to categorize the nature of responses, types of questions, depth of ideas, evidence use, argumentation patterns, and so forth (e.g., Baker et al., 2007; Hakkarainen, 2003; Hmelo-Silver, 2003; van Aalst &amp;amp; Chan, 2007; Weinberger &amp;amp; Fischer, 2006; Zhang et al., 2007); (b) Socio interaction measures, focusing on contribution rate, reading rate, conversation threads (build-on trees), social networks of who reads or responds to whose postings (Aviv, Erlich, Ravid, &amp;amp; Geva, 2003; de Laat, Lally, Lipponen, &amp;amp; Simons, 2007; Guzdial &amp;amp; Turns, 2000; Hewitt &amp;amp; Teplovs, 1999; Hewitt, Brett, &amp;amp; Peters, 2007; Howell-Richardson &amp;amp; Mellar, 1996; Zhang, Scardamalia, Reeve, &amp;amp; Richard, 2009); and &amp;copy; Linguistic markers of discourse, such as occurrences of epistemic words and domainspecific key terms in discourse (Hong &amp;amp; Scardamalia, 2008; Sun, Zhang, &amp;amp; Scardamalia, 2010). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Note contribution interaction measures Note reading percentage Note reading network: in-degree and out-degree Note linking network: in-degree and out-degree Note linking network: cliques (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1st 1,000 words Academic words Domain-specific words (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used social network analysis to examine two types of social relations recorded by Knowledge Forum: (a) who read whose notes, with reading peers’ notes as a primary mean to understanding knowledge advances and challenges of the community; and (b) who linked to whose notes (i.e., created build-ons, rise-aboves, or references), as a indicator of complementary and connected contributions. Three measures were included in this analysis: (a) indegree showing how many relational ties (e.g., reading, linking) a member received from peers, suggesting the level of his/her influence; (b) out-degree measuring the number of relational ties one sent out to other peers as an indicator of his/her effort to understand and build on peer contributions; and &amp;copy; clique analysis, which identified sub-networks each member belonged to in the note linking network, as an indicator of communitywide dynamic collaboration. A clique is “a sub-set of a network in which the actors are more closely and intensively tied to one another than they are to other members of the network.” (Hanneman, 2001, p. 79) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whose notes, with reading peers’ notes as a primary mean to understanding knowledge advances and challenges of the community; and (b) who linked to whose notes (i.e., created build-ons, rise-aboves, or references), as a indicator of complementary and connected contributions. Three measures were included in this analysis: (a) indegree showing how many relational ties (e.g., reading, linking) a member received from peers, suggesting the level of his/her influence; (b) out-degree measuring the number of relational ties one sent out to other peers as an indicator of his/her effort to understand and build on peer contributions; and &amp;copy; clique analysis, which identified sub-networks each member belonged to in the note linking network, as an indicator of communitywide dynamic collaboration. A clique is “a sub-set of a network in which the actors are more closely and intensively tied to one another than they are to other members of the network.” (Hanneman, 2001, p. 79) (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content analysis (Chi, 1997) was adopted to code: (a) questions identified by students in their notes (e.g., how do solar panels work?); (b) student personal ideas that presented their own theories and claims often labeled as “My theory” (e.g., “If there is no light, there can’t be a shadow”); &amp;copy; information sources, to introduce new information from readings, the Internet, the teacher, or parents, etc., often labeled as “New information,” and use the information to deepen their understanding; (d) evidence, to examine and deepen their understanding using findings from experiments and observations; and (e) inquiry threads contributed to. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing use of sophisticated, low frequency words in free writing indicates growth of productive vocabulary and writing skills (Nation 2001). Thus, lexical frequency analysis was employed to examine student use of three types of words in their online discourse: (a) The first 1,000 most frequent word families in English (West, 1953). Low-proficiency writers tend to rely more on these basic word families in writing; (b) A list of academic words, including 570 word families that are typical of academic discourse across disciplinary areas, enabling references to other authors and findings (e.g., assume, establish, conclude) and processing of data and ideas (e.g., analyze, assess, category) (Coxhead 1998). Writers need to gain productive written control of the academic vocabulary in order to be recognized as a member of the academic discourse community (Corson, 1997); and &amp;copy; Domain-specific terms, which included 89 domain words related to light (e.g., names of optical concepts, devices and phenomena) identified from the Ontario Curriculum (Sun et al., 2010). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several social interaction measures indicate productive discourse to achieve deep understanding, including the number of notes contributed, percentage of notes read, in-degree (being read by peers) and out-degree (reading peers’ work) in the note reading network, and in-degree (being built on by peers) and dynamic memberships in cliques (sub-networks) in the note linking network developed through build-ons, rise-aboves, and referencing citations of peer ideas. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content-based discourse indicators associated with student deep understanding involve the number of notes contributing personal theories, identifying deepening problems, and incorporating new information sources, with student contributions to multiple inquiry threads strongly connected to the scope of their optical understanding. The number of notes reporting evidence is not significantly correlated to the depth of student understanding, possibly because this analysis only considered the frequency of evidence use. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, all the lexical discourse measures have significant correlations to the depth of student understanding, including total words written, occurrences of academic words and domain-specific words (both total and unique words), and less frequent use of the 1st 1,000 English word families. Incorporating unique domain-specific words in the knowledge building discourse additionally suggests the expanding scope and breadth of inquiry. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, these two studies used a revised version of the EPS (Education Participation Scale) to measure motivation of continuing education among nurses. Two studies were different in terms of sample size &amp;ndash; the 1982 study surveyed around 1800 nurses (twice as big as in the 1979 study). The dimensions arrived in each study are also different. Below are from the 1979 study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compliance with authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improvement in social relations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improvement in social welfare skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;professional advancement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;professional knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relief from routine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acquisition of credentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1982 study didn&amp;rsquo;t find #7 as an important factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both articles did additional analysis finding correlations among different dimensions and their relation with other demographic variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(One GREAT thing about these articles is all items in Modified-EPS are listed in a table, with their membership in each motivational dimension also presented.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to me as an instructor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This study reports on correlation analyses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion points

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;correlation vs. causation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what constitutes strong correlation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to go from correlations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to write a discussion section?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present study had a twofold aim. On the one hand, it aimed at assessing Greek preschool children’s playfulness employing Children’s Playfulness Scale. On the other hand, it aimed at examining whether personal and family variables affect children’s playfulness. Results suggest that the sample exhibits rather medium levels of playfulness and that during play they enact more cognitive spontaneity, compared with other components of playfulness. Thus, correlation analysis showed that playfulness components predict one another and that several personal and family characteristics correlate with playfulness’ aspects. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;em&lt;br /&gt;
 emh.. ‘correlation = causation’ alert. Read more… (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though playfulness, as a notion, is employed in accordance with the notion of play, there is a different meaning in the terms ‘play’ and ‘playful’ (Lester &amp;amp; Russell, 2010; Youell, 2008). According to Burghardt (2005.cited in Lester &amp;amp; Russell, 2010) ‘play is the outward expression or actualisation of a playful disposition whereas being playful represents a particular approach to life, an urge to be open to and explore possibilities, to perceive and act in a way that denotes a sense of optimism and belief in one’s own agency’ (p. 8). Lester and Russell (2010) conclude that while play refers to the behaviour one employs, playfulness refers to ‘being’ (p. 16). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, while playfulness and play have different meaning they are interlinked, they are united concepts and playfulness is the actual essence of play (Cornelli Sanderson, 2010; Youell, 2008). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories and definitions of playfulness (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the first who coined the term was Lieberman (1965), who maintained that playfulness is an internal characteristic of children and that playfulness is a unitary trait characterised by five components: (a) physical spontaneity, (b) social spontaneity, &amp;copy; cognitive spontaneity, (d) manifest of joy, and (e) sense of humour. Lieberman (1965, 1966) based on those five components was the first who introduced an instrument in order to measure children’s playfulness. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Barnett (1998) maintains, many authors report the existence of a playful personality trait, which refers to traits such as cheerful, joyous, humorous, and playful attitude, witty, energetic, being good natured, laughing readily, liking to participate with other people, imaginativeness, emotional expressiveness, curiosity, openness, novelty seeking, and communicativeness (p. 99). Recently, Barnett (2007) has defined playfulness as a ‘capacity to frame or reframe a situation in such a way as to provide oneself (and possibly others) with amusement, humour, and/or entertainment’ (p. 955). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bundy (1997), playfulness is characterised by intrinsic motivation, internal control, the freedom to suspend reality, and framing. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Lindquist (2001), a playful disposition ‘represents a stance to the world and can permeate all spheres of life&amp;hellip;playfulness can appear wherever agency and intentionality open space’ (p. 21). Morrison, Bundy, and Fisher (1991) define playfulness as ‘the combinations of a child’s feeling of control over the environment, internal motivation, and ability to be creative or imaginative’ (p. 688). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the above-mentioned definitions, it becomes evident that there are two different approaches to playfulness. On the one hand, playfulness is encountered as a stable personality trait and on the other hand playfulness is viewed as depending on the context. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importance of playfulness (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas a vast amount of research has been undergone in order to examine how play affects children’s overall development, this is not the case for playfulness. The limited research conducted indicates that playfulness helps children learn to relate to others, communicate, and become an individual through the context of play (Jenkinson, 2001); helps children deal with anxiety and frustration (Moran, 1987) and enables them to regulate their distress back to their baseline anxiety levels following an anxiety induction event (Barnett, 1998); enhances children’s creativity and problem solving abilities (Barnett, 1991a; Meador, 1992); helps children regulate, express and understand their emotions (Barnett, 1991a, 1991b, 1998); fosters children’s confidence (Barnett, 1991a) and the development and use of humour (Barnett, 1991a, 1991b, 2007; McGhee, 1979); promotes children’s healthy development and well being (Cornelli Sanderson, 2010; Lester &amp;amp; Russell, 2010); supports children show traits such as: confidence, imagination, mischievousness, intensity, cheerfulness, curiosity, adaptation, and impulsivity (Barnett, 1991b; Lieberman, 1965, 1977); reinforces children’s expression of affect in play, physical activity, imagination, and social interactions in play (Singer, Singer, &amp;amp; Sherrod, 1980). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, less playful children seem to be considered as docile, dependent, disobedient, and less likely to seek novel situations or express themselves than playful peers (Barnett, 1991b). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables affecting playfulness (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research results indicate that playfulness as well as differences in playfulness depends on individual characteristics and variables (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literature review suggests that playfulness correlates with children’s personality (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;traits, personal and family characteristics (sex, age, birth order, family size), creativity, gender, temperament, the environment, parental attitudes towards play, and social and cultural factors (Barnett, 1991b, 1998; Cooper, 2000; Cornelli Sanderson, 2010; IzumiTaylor et al., 1999; Lieberman, 1965, 1977; Rigby, 2007; Trevlas, Matsouka, &amp;amp; Zachopoulou, 2003; Zachopoulou, 2003; Zachopoulou, Trevlas, &amp;amp; Tsikriki, 2004). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gender (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;age (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;birth order (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;social and cultural factors (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;environment (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present study (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reported study aims at recording Greek preschoolers’ playfulness and examining correlations among playfulness and personal and family characteristics (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children’s Playfulness Scale: Barnett’s (1990, 1991a, 1991b) CPS constitutes a revised and improved version of Lieberman’s (1965, 1966) instrument. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23 items which are subdivided into the five components initially introduced by Lieberman. These are, according to Barnett (1998): physical spontaneity, which includes energy expenditure and physical challenge and risk elements (five items); social spontaneity, which includes the cooperative and competitive interactions with others and the apparent ease or lack of it as well as the leader–follower characterisation (four items); cognitive spontaneity, which includes the fine motor manipulations and symbolic activity as in imaginary themes and roles and the use of pretense (five items); manifest of joy, which includes the affective quality so evident in the spontaneity and exuberance of various play interactions both alone and with others (five items); and sense of humour, which refers to the verbalisations and mimicry and imitative rhyming (four items). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of results (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Table 1 are presented the mean scores assigned in each of the five components of playfulness and the scale as a whole. As shown in the table, the highest mean score was assigned in the cognitive spontaneity component (M &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 3.20) and the lowest mean score in the physical spontaneity component (M &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 2.17). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all playfulness components correlate among each other and there is also a significant correlation between playfulness components and the total playfulness. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to examine correlations of the five components of playfulness and the total playfulness ratings with children’s personal and family characteristics, bivariate correlations and multiple regression analysis were employed. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results are presented in Table 4. As shown in the table, most of the personal and family’s characteristics variables are significantly correlated to both the components of playfulness and the total playfulness. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research results of the present study indicate that the preschoolers who participated in the study exhibit high levels of cognitive development (M &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 3.20) and sense of humour (M &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 2.90). On the contrary, the sample seems to show lower levels of physical spontaneity (M &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 2.17). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research results, in case they are substantiated by other research too, may suggest the need to shift into playful pedagogies and that children’s play is not solely fun and wandering. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Izumi-Taylor, Pramling Samuelsson, and Rogers (2010) based on their research results summarise the benefits stemming from play into the following themes: (1) play as a process of learning (children gain knowledge and skills); (2) play as a source of possibilities (children make choices and changes); (3) play as empowerment (children deal with life); (4) play as creativity (children foster originality and imagination); (5) play as children’s work (children understand their environment); (6) play as fun activities (children gain fun and pleasure). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research results may suggest that children are not provided with abundance of space in order to play and engage in physical activity. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to correlation analysis results show significant correlations among the components of the CPS. This finding substantiates the argument that children’s areas of development are interrelated and interlinked (Berk, 2001; Bredekamp &amp;amp; Copple, 1998) and that play contributes into children’s overall development. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aim of the study was to explore whether personal and family characteristics affect playfulness. Correlation analysis revealed moderate and significant correlations between characteristics and the five components of playfulness as well as between characteristics and overall playfulness. More precisely, children’s age has been found to be negatively correlated with the social spontaneity component. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;??&lt;br /&gt;
 This paragraph confirm my earlier doubt on the ‘causation vs. correlation’ on this paper.&lt;br /&gt;
 Also, correlations found in this paper are generally weak (&amp;lt; .3; not moderate).&lt;br /&gt;
 In addition, the author should also make it clear which measures were used for each bivariate correlation analysis. Unclear from the table.&lt;br /&gt;
 (The discussion is hard to follow. Too many short paragraphs, with sporadic ideas here and there — at least from my perception.) (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children’s type of family (nuclear, single parent and extended) has been found to be correlated with total playfulness as well with all playfulness components but from the social spontaneity component. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of one widely cited model of self‐regulated learning proposed by Winne and Hadwin (1998; Winne, 2011; Greene &amp;amp; Azevedo, 2007), learners exercise agency across four loosely sequenced phases: (1) They scan their environment to identify internal factors (cognitive, motivational, affective) and external features that may influence a task. (2) They frame goals and design plans to approach them. (3) They implement actions to animate their plans, monitor the match between a plan and its actualization and modestly adjust actions as they judge appropriate. And, (4) they re‐examine aspects across these three prior phases to consider major, strategic revisions to understanding and action if progress toward goals is blocked, too slow or in some other way unsatisfactory. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diversity of papers in this special section offers an interesting snapshot of the current state of research into SRL and learning analytics. Several themes emerge: (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Choices. Rather than looking at the content of learners’ actions, we can look at the choices that learners make. SRL theories describe how students manage their learning, and open ended environments that gather trace data about these processes allow us to evaluate the types of actions students choose to perform, rather than only their content (Cutumisu; Colthorpe) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Relativity. Actions are neither inherently good nor bad. Rather, choices students make reflect their perceived challenges, knowledge, prior experiences, and habits. Thus, actions should be interpreted in relation to a learner’s context (Biswas; Nussbaumer). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Reusable analytics. The volume of learning data gathered in online settings affords new opportunities to explore complex research questions. New methods and analytical techniques that provide insight into the complexity of SRL represented in these spaces are required. Specifically, we see a shift from looking at individual events to looking at sequences of actions (Biswas; Bannert). Developing new tools that can be reused across contexts and settings can contribute to the generality of theories and to support and evaluate transfer of SRL patterns (Biswas; Colthorpe). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Challenge: operationalization. Many of the papers address similar constructs (e.g., planning, revising) and operationalize them in different ways, contextualized in their respective systems. Learning analytics allows us to take abstract constructs and instantiate them in different learning environments. Comparing and contrasting these instantiations can help us evaluate the effect of contextual and environmental factors on learners’ SRL. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world, however, is stochastic; so methods for detecting patterns – human and machine – must wrestle with noise and indeterminacy. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to this problem requires two distinct moves. The first is gathering an increased variety of types of data such that each type of data is relatively statistically independent of other types. The second move is to massively increase the volume of data. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This two‐pronged approach leads to four implications for learning analytics and research on self‐ regulated learning. First, instrumentation needs to be designed that learners can use nearly ubiquitously. This helps to increase the volume of data. Winne and his colleagues’ nStudy platform (e.g., Winne, 2015) and content‐agnostic learning management systems illustrate this step. However, as learning technologies evolve, the footprint of any single system shrinks. Thus, systems need to support better interoperability. New technologies and standards (such as TinCan xAPI) attempt to bridge this gap. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, algorithms capable of detecting partitions or clusters in vastly dimensional, big data need to be improved or invented. Presently, analytics that are supposedly general are often tested only in one setting. Researchers should evaluate the generalizability not only of theories, but also of tools and methodologies. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, as data are collected more ubiquitously, we need to do a better job of attending to and capturing features of context. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait – isn’t this temporal structure fundamentally the same as temporally unfolding SRL wherein an agentic learner reviews her learning history to judge and adjust learning activities? Yes, it is. We surmise a bridge to join the solo to the social context for regulated learning activities lies in using the topic a learner studies as a means to follow how “threads” of content unfold across time in conjunction with patterns of self‐regulated learning. To our knowledge, methods are not yet available that can simultaneously track patterns in which elements simultaneously represent the topic (subject matter, features of group process, a learner’s affect) in the same unit as a representation of the cognitive operations applied to that topic. We recommend this as a topic worthy of future work. Furthermore, as learning is often a social process, designs for learning analytics need to take account of how a group regulates its learning, i.e., forms of co‐regulated and socially‐shared regulation of learning (Hadwin, Jarvella, and Miller, 2011). The field needs to make progress toward mapping and developing learning analytics for nested models of regulated learning. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, many of the challenges faced by learning analysts who explore self‐regulated learning are shared with colleagues working in the field of data mining (see Winne &amp;amp; Baker, 2013). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thisarticleoffersavisionfortechnologysupportedcollaborativeanddiscussionbased learning at scale. (p. 660)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, this support has been enabled by an integration of text mining and conversational agents to form a novel type of micro-script support for productive discussion processes. (p. 660)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next 25 years, we expect to see this early, emerging work in MOOC contexts grow into ubiquitously available social learning approaches in free online learning environments like MOOCs, or what comes next in the online learning space. These ambitious social learning approaches include Problem Based Learning, Team Project Based Learning, and Collaborative Reflection. We expect to see the capability of drawing in and effectively supporting learners of all walks of life, especially impacting currently under-served learners. (p. 660)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction (p. 661)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across theoretical frameworks in which learning is studied, including behaviorist, cognitive constructivist, and sociocultural perspectives, conversation is valued (Hmelo-Silver et al. 2013; Resnick et al. 2015). (p. 661)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;conversation&lt;br /&gt;
 diff w/ discourse? (p. 661)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing interest and involvement in development of technologies to support discussion for learning has been represented within the AI in Education community over the past two decades. Beginning in the mid-90s, this interest initially focused mainly on the area of tutorial dialogue systems to support individual learning (Evens and Michael 2006; Aleven et al. 2003; Zinn et al. 2002; VanLehn et al. 2002) and gradually included more and more emphasis over the past decade on computer-supported collaborative learning supported by conversational agents and other dynamic support technologies (Kumar et al. 2007; Kumar and Rosé 2011; Dyke et al. 2013; Adamson et al. 2014). (p. 661)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there are almost always discussion forums included in these environments, they are often just an appendage, and not effective in meeting the needs of learners, especially under-served learners who need more support. (p. 661)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical Foundations (p. 662)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tutorial Dialogue (p. 662)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;expert human tutors are highly successful at educating students (Bloom 1984; Cohen et al. 1982). (p. 662)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emulating this B2 sigma effect^ has long been the holy grail of intelligent tutoring research. (p. 662)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search for the answer to the elusive B2 sigma effect^ has taken many forms, but one common thread through generations of investigation has been the belief that the answer lies in the natural language dialogue that is the dominant form of communication between students and human tutors. (p. 662)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in recent years a growing amount of attention turned to the use of conversational agents as facilitators in collaborative learning interactions (p. 662)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;carefully designed agents (Kumar et al. 2007; Dyke et al. 2013; Adamson et al. 2014). From a different angle, some recent work still targeting individual learning with technology has sought to leverage the same feel of a group interaction through multiple agents interacting with individual students in what are referred to as trialogues (Graesser et al. 2014). (p. 663)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (p. 663)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This earlier work, referred to as scripted collaboration, has been a major focus of the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning in the past decade, and despite its limitations, has produced numerous demonstrations of its effectiveness in improving collaborative learning. (p. 663)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context-sensitive or need-based support necessitates on-line monitoring of collaborative learning processes. Automatic analysis of collaborative processes is an advance in the field of Language Technologies that has value for real time assessment during collaborative learning, for dynamically triggering supportive interventions in the midst of collaborative-learning sessions, and for facilitating efficient analysis of collaborativelearning processes. (p. 663)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frameworks for analysis of group knowledge building are plentiful and include examples such as Transactivity (Berkowitz and Gibbs 1983; Teasley 1997; Weinberger and Fischer 2006), Intersubjective Meaning Making (Suthers 2006), and Productive Agency (Schwartz 1998). (p. 663)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;terms&lt;br /&gt;
 text-based interactions and key-click data — match with what we are writing in the proposal. (p. 663)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;text-based interactions and key-click data (Soller and Lesgold 2000; Erkens and Janssen 2006; Rosé et al., 2008; McLaren et al. 2007; Mu, Stegmann, Mayfield, Rosé, &amp;amp; Fischer, 2012). (p. 663)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;audio data has begun (Gweon et al. 2013) (p. 663)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moocs: The Bleeding Edge (p. 664)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can improve the experience of community and social support around MOOCs, we may potentially decrease attrition for the current ilk of MOOC participants. (p. 664)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity for impact is great if we look past the top tier and other four year institutions of higher learning, and instead target community college level instruction.1 (p. 664)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a supportive environment in which these learners can find community, support, dignity, and respect is essential for achieving this impact. (p. 664)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual-Layer Moocs: A Case Study (p. 664)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was termed a Bdual layer^ MOOC because students had the option of following a more standard path housed in the edX platform for moving through the course in one layer or to follow a more self-directed path in an environment called ProSolo,2 developed by Gašević and colleagues that formed a second layer. (p. 665)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the ProSolo integration was two-fold a) increasing the social learning experiences of self-regulated learners in MOOCs through social competency approaches to learning and b) developing learner knowledge graphs that reflect what a learner knows and how they have come to know it. (p. 665)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning in ProSolo is social in the sense that students follow and communicate with other students during the process of setting their learning objectives. However, beyond that, the learning experiences students engaged in within the ProSolo environment are still largely individual in character. (p. 665)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that context, we deployed two different interventions leveraging advances in Language Technologies such as automated analysis of discussion behavior to trigger dynamic support (using an unsupervised matrix factorization approach), including what we termed the Quick Helper and a direct import of our agent supported collaborative learning technology, which we referred to as Bazaar Collaborative Reflection in this context. (p. 665)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next 25 years, we expect to see social learning practices supported more effectively at scale, overcoming coordination challenges, and provided ubiquitously within free learning environments, such as MOOCs. (p. 665)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quick Helper (p. 665)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to support help seeking as well as increase the probability that help requests will be met with a satisfactory response. (p. 666)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our help seeking intervention connects students, whose questions may go unresolved, with student peers who may be able to answer their question. (p. 666)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is the first step towards bringing peer help recommendation into the MOOC space considering the unique characteristics of MOOCs such as the relatively weak social bonds between students, the great diversity among students, the lack of knowledge about specific students, and the wide range of motivations for students to participate in a MOOC which influences their possible roles as help providers. Future progress in user modeling based on the noisy MOOC data and taking into account the social ties between users within and outside of the MOOC platform will allow us move towards more sophisticated help recommendation approaches as proposed and achieved using knowledge based approaches in related work on online help recommendation for on-campus education such as i-Help (Greer et al. 1998; Vassileva et al. (p. 666)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bazaar Collaborative Reflection (p. 667)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another intervention, referred to as Bazaar Collaborative Reflection, makes synchronous collaboration opportunities available to students in a MOOC context. (p. 667)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the number of clicks on videos and the participation in discussion forums as control variables, we found that the participation in chats lowers the risk of dropout by approximately 50 % (Ferschke et al. 2015b). (p. 667)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into The Future (p. 667)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of social recommender systems (such as Quick Helper) and group collaboration tools (such as Bazaar) are expected to lead to higher levels of metacognitive monitoring, which we expect to be associated with an increase of confidence, feeling of knowing, judgment of learning, and monitoring of progress toward goals. (p. 667)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is both to design and build platform extensions to support effective learning, but also to provide new opportunities to study learning through discussion in new ways and in novel contexts, for example, addressing important questions related to learning in highly diverse collaborative groups. (p. 668)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projecting the inspiration for our Bdual layer MOOC^ into the future, we envision MOOCs of the future as gateways into persistent Communities of Practice. (p. 668)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good point&lt;br /&gt;
 A good point worth considering in the context of PKU MOOCs! (p. 668)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades of research studying the inner workings of these communities, whether focused on learning, work or a hybrid of the two, has revealed that a central problem underlying the success of these efforts is channeling the attention and efforts of the masses. This channeling may partly be achieved through facilitation of consensus and coordination achieved through a careful balance of guidance and self-direction. On the other hand, unless this is balanced with an effort to avoid premature consensus, group think, or abandonment of valuable ideas that may simply have been overlooked, support for coordination and consensus building could hinder the development of creativity or the growth of innovation. (p. 669)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposed solution to this complex and multi-faceted challenge is to provide noncoercive personalized guidance through awareness tools that reveal the shape and foci of the behavior data and resulting byproducts in a way that makes it natural for collaboration to grow out of individual decision-making. We have begun to lay a foundation for this work through technology that is able to identify role-based behavior profiles associated with productive group and community outcomes. (p. 669)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead through a theory guided but data driven process, we identify which configurations of behaviors are achieving positive outcomes, and then work to foster greater representation of these behavior profiles. (p. 669)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, many challenges exist: traditionally, Knowledge Forum has been mainly used in classroom settings, and there is much to learn as it is (p. 669)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;adapted for use in a MOOC context. In Knowledge Building classrooms, the teacher plays an important role setting the culture in which Knowledge Building can take place. How can we replicate that in a MOOC? One question is related to structuring interaction. cMOOCs are loosely structured, perhaps more so than the approach to Knowledge Building that has been done in classrooms. The design space is wide open. On one end of the spectrum one might imagine a Knowledge Building MOOC, which would be Ba MOOCified Knowledge Forum^. (p. 670)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, elements of Knowledge Building might be made available within courses structured in more typical learning progressions and employing other pedagogies as well. A third option might be to introduce the Knowledge Forum approach into an environment where large scale collaboration is already happening for producing new knowledge, such as wikis. In this paradigm, wiki activities would be embedded in MOOCs with support for knowledge building scoped within the wiki. Another issue to consider is the role of the instructor. (p. 670)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Role Of Natural Language Processing (p. 670)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long time members of the computational linguistics community have observed the paradigm shift that took place after the middle of the 1990s. Initially, approaches that combined symbolic and statistical methods were still of interest (Klavans and Resnick 1994). However, with the increasing focus on very large corpora and leveraging of new frameworks for large scale statistical modeling, symbolic and knowledge driven methods for natural language processing were largely left by the wayside. (p. 670)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, the shift towards big data came with the ability to build real world systems relatively quickly. However, as knowledge-based methods were replaced with statistical models, a grounding in linguistic theory grew more and more devalued, and instead a desire to replace theory with an almost atheoretical empiricism (p. 670)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over time, an awareness began to grow that social data had characteristics on its own, and new methods would be needed in order to achieve adequate results. It was at this point that interest in computational social science as the answer to this need began to arise. (p. 671)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atheoretical empiricism is not attractive within the behavioral sciences, including the learning sciences, where the primary value is on building theory and engaging theory in interpretation of models. In the learning sciences, process measurements must be motivated in the theory in order to be valid. (p. 671)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a very basic level, work within the area of computational sociolinguistics draws from social psychological concepts of relative power in social situations (Guinote and Vesvio 2010), in particular aspects of relative power that operate at the level of individuals in relation to specific others within groups or communities. At this level, relative power may be thought of as operating in terms of horizontal positioning, which relates to closeness and related constructs such as positive regard, trust and commitment, or vertical positioning, which relates to authority and related constructs such as approval and respect. (p. 671)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a conceptual level, this work draws heavily from a foundation in linguistic pragmatics (Levinson 1983) as well as sociological theories of discourse (Gee 2011). (p. 671)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this very general framing provides an umbrella under which work within this area can be placed, the specific framing of individual publications varies substantially. At one end of the spectrum, some contemporary publications in the Language Technologies field are motivated purely from within the Language Technologies literature with a focus either on categories of conversational behavior defined in earlier research (Zhai and Williams 2014; Hasan and Ng 2014; Nguyen et al. 2012), or framed from purely a task related perspective (Bhatia et al. 2014) or a modeling perspective (Paul 2012). (p. 672)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a substantial amount of work in this area has leveraged or at least references theoretical frameworks from Social Psychology (Bak et al. 2014; Bracewell et al. 2012). (p. 672)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this bridging between fields continues to grow, we are in a better position to use theoretical insights into the deep inner workings of language to motivate design decisions that underlie the computational models we build. These insights have the potential to yield greater validity in the work on learning analytics applied to conversational interaction data. (p. 672)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflections (p. 673)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than regarding MOOCs as scaled-up virtual classrooms, they should be compared to interactive textbooks around which communities of practice are formed that engage in collaborative learning and cooperative work driven by a common interest. (p. 673)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current generation of MOOCs have sometimes been referred to as the Alta Vista of MOOCs, and we have not yet seen the Google Search of MOOCs. By the end of the next 25 years, we expect that the very idea of a MOOC per se will have faded into a distant memory, and will be replaced with a new, far more effective paradigm for learning at scale. Our vision is that this paradigm will be one where ambitious social learning practices will be ubiquitously offered, such as Problem Based Learning, Team Based Learning, Collaborative Reflection, and spontaneous personalized mentoring. These new environments will be active, thriving, communities where students are supported on their personal learning path. (p. 674)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“appropriate empirical evaluation” that can identify those things that “are in fact improvements,” that will in turn “contribute to the bigger pic- ture of scientific knowledge” (p. 11). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;s far back as the 1950s (as many education researchers well know), federal efforts to reshape education drew on research practices and organiza- tional approaches from the natural sciences, where instrumental success and cumulative progress are the norms. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reading the text from the IES call for proposals, the effort to apply a particular vision of science is readily apparent. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unproductive history of educational practice that ebbs and flows without clear direction (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we accept the fact that our research methods are dependent on what it is we are seeking to understand, it makes sense, then, to ask ourselves whether the phenomena of teaching and learn- ing are best examined using an experimental approach (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, we have individuals like the Nobel Prize– winning physicist–turned–education researcher, Carl Wieman (2007), who has argued that efforts to produce effective teaching at scalable levels can be had only by applying “practices that are essential components of scientific research” (p. 10). Such prac- tices, he notes, “explain why science has progressed at such a remarkable pace in the modern world” (Wieman, 2007, p. 10). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the kind of knowledge we are able to produce is clearly dependent on the phenomena under study. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IES leaders explicitly drew on exper- imental models from the fields of medicine and agriculture, where randomized controlled trials were the standard (see, e.g., U.S. Department of Education, 2003). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allure of these scientific research models is obvious. In the face of complex and persistent educational problems, they seem to promise objective results, uniform solutions, and stan- dardized interventions less prone to ideological distortion that will actually “work” in our nation’s classrooms (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the field of education, however, researchers are trying to understand things that are far more complex: the way students learn from text, lecture, visual representations, or combinations thereof. They seek to find out, in addition, how that learning is shaped by prior knowledge and experience and by interactions with teachers and student peers. Complicating the picture is the fact that the object of study in education research is a knowing participant who can resist, cooperate, or simply not engage in the instruction being observed (a character- istic not typically found among subatomic particles or even most mammals). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Science” for the average citi- zen typically entails some activity centered around experimenta- tion whereby a hypothesis or conjecture is demonstrated to be true (or false) with absolute certainty, often revealing in the pro- cess knowledge of how this or that corner of nature “really works” (Lederman, 1992). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context matters as well in ways that are irrelevant to physical systems. It is one thing to limit study to what happens within a classroom, but classrooms exist in a broader matrix of institu- tions, political systems, and cultures. Whether and what learning takes place are highly contingent on everything from immediate and long-term educational goals to local and national politics, considerations of the global economy, and the allocation of resources (again, to highlight only a handful of factors). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science, at least this particular version of it, possesses a level of cultural authority that is unmatched in modern society (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular view of science, however, represents only a narrow slice of the myriad intellectual, social, and cultural prac- tices that fall under the rubric of science more broadly consid- ered. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would add that all of this changes over time. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, the work of scientists is distributed among a diverse number of smaller research communities, each of which organically fashions its own set of methods, standards of evi- dence, types of representation, forms of argumentation, social and institutional arrangements, and the like depending on both the nature of the phenomena being studied and the questions deemed worthy of exploring. That is to say that the methods of inquiry are highly contextual, contingent, and emergent over time. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.e., different paradigms (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, teaching and learning, as they happen in classrooms and lecture halls all over the world—and through time—are far different phenomena from those studied in con- trolled laboratory settings or even in field studies of naturally occurring plant or animal populations. Education, as an empiri- cal phenomenon, is just the sort of context-sensitive, dynami- cally responsive complex system that philosopher of science Sandra Mitchell (2009) argues requires research methods that are locally applied, tolerant of uncertainty, and pragmatically (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;adopted to meet particular social ends at a given point in time— methods that go well beyond randomized controlled trials. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are without a doubt aspects of learning and educa- tional practice that are amenable to experimental and quasi- experimental study, and with some questions, real progress can indeed be made. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More work clearly needs to be done to better understand how research, policy, and practice might be most productively integrated for the broader goal of social improvement. Helping the public and poli- cymakers (who, after all, in our democratic political system are members of the public) understand just how various scientific research practices work to generate reliable knowledge seems to be a logical first step. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is a much needed positive vibe going forward. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we should rightly be concerned when poli- cymakers (supported by a public operating with an incomplete understanding of what science is and how it works) seek to push particular research models and methodological approaches in a misguided attempt to secure knowledge outcomes (reliable, pre- dictable, uniform, etc.) that are unlikely to be obtained given the nature of the activities and enterprise in question. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just the kind of things that fall into what the sociologist of science Thomas Gieryn (1999) has termed “boundary work.” (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, if we accept the fact that physical and educational sys- tems operate at fundamentally different levels of complexity, then any attempt to move education toward a hard-science research model in which we try to measure and/or control key variables is bound to fail at the broad-based societal levels that really matter. Put simply, the things we are able to measure in such a system rarely conform to the learning outcomes we most highly value as a society. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second possibility relates more directly to the power the experimental model has to shape the world outside the labora- tory. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would need to, in other words, make the naturally occurring system more like the experimental system, a change that would require the simplification of natural learning environments. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rummel, N., Walker, E., &amp;amp; Aleven, V. (2016). Different Futures of Adaptive Collaborative Learning Support. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 26(2), 784–795.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this position paper we contrast a Dystopian view of the future of adaptive collaborative learning support (ACLS) with a Utopian scenario that – due to betterdesigned technology, grounded in research – avoids the pitfalls of the Dystopian version and paints a positive picture of the practice of computer-supported collaborative learning 25 years from now. (p. 784)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we see a need to work towards a comprehensive instructional framework building on educational theory. This framework will allow us to provide nuanced and flexible (i.e. intelligent) ACLS to collaborative learners – the type of support we sketch in our Utopian scenario. (p. 784)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present paper focuses on an area where computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and AIED research intersect: adaptive collaborative learning support (ACLS, see Walker et al. 2009b). (p. 784)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the 2014 IJAIED special issue entitled BIntelligent Support for Learning in Groups^ (ISLG) (p. 784)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we consider two possible futures for the area of adaptive support for collaborative learning. First, we sketch a scenario that illustrates where ACLS might be 25 years down the road if technological solutions are not informed by educational theory and research. It is a scenario that we view as Dystopian, because the full potential that we see for adaptive and adaptable technologies has not been fully realized. (p. 785)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a contrast we present a more optimistic, Utopian, scenario, one in which learners are empowered for collaborative learning by flexible, adaptive support that avoids the pitfalls of the Dystopian scenario. The Utopian scenario requires a challenging research agenda for the next 25 years. We pose that working towards a comprehensive instructional framework for ACLS can help to prevent the Dystopian and pave the way for a Utopian future of ACLS. (p. 785)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-Forward to the Year 2040: a Dystopian Scenario (p. 785)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOk,^ Mr. Roebeck said, Bget in your pairs and check your prescribed activity.^ (p. 786)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they worked, the system continuously prompted, BJanet, can you explain your reasoning?^ BJanet, what do you think about what Roxanne just said?^ (p. 786)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, RUWAAL had diagnosed her as a Bpoor collaborator.^ Mr. Roebeck had told her parents that she would be getting remediation (p. 786)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpacking the Dystopian Scenario (p. 787)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of pedagogical decisions that is supported by or taken over by technology will likely expand compared to what is available today: automatic group formation, selection of activities for each group, and adaptive prompting and scripting to ensure learners are collaborating and learning effectively. (p. 787)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there is much that is unsatisfying about this scenario. The system makes decisions about what will lead Janet to learn most effectively based on data about her, and other students’, current and past activities, but these decisions lack nuance and flexibility, leading to frustration and ultimately to a lack of trust in the system. (p. 787)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key shortcoming of RUWAAL is that the different dimensions of support in its ACLS are not well coordinated and thus are not working together in a coherent, holistic way (p. 787)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related shortcoming evident from the Dystopian scenario is that the system’s pedagogy is very limited. (p. 787)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final problem is that RUWAAL’s decisions are inscrutable to learners and teachers. (p. 788)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Contrasting View: a Utopian Scenario for 2040 (p. 788)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpacking the Utopian Scenario (p. 789)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its decision making is driven by theory, takes into account a variety of pedagogical goals (including learning at the domain level and learning of collaboration skills), and draws on a wide arsenal of pedagogical strategies. It coordinates support across multiple (p. 789)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dimensions (e.g., timing of support, psychological realm of support, mode of support, and support type), enabling it to flexibly adapt to students’ needs. Finally, the system is adaptable: It is transparent, works synergistically with students and teachers, and shares control with them. (p. 790)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACLS system’s balanced theory-driven integration of multiple dimensions of support for collaborative learning is on display when our student (Janet) spontaneously starts to self-explain a difficult chemistry concept. (p. 790)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario also illustrates the importance of creating technology that is adaptable. (p. 790)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Research Agenda for 2016-2040 (p. 791)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences between our two scenarios exemplify the dilemmas that designers of ACLS systems face. The kind of coordinated pedagogical decision making illustrated in the Utopian scenario is a tough balancing act, even for humans, but one that the area of ACLS will need to tackle. (p. 791)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the issues identified in unpacking the Dystopian scenario, we see a need to work towards a comprehensive instructional framework firmly rooted in educational theory that can guide the development of nuanced and flexible ACLS systems. (p. 791)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed research can build on prior work in ACLS, which has produced several taxonomies of support for collaborating students. These taxonomies (e.g. Diziol and Rummel 2010; Walker et al. 2009a) identify dimensions such as the timing of support (whether it is provided immediately or with some delay during the collaboration, or before or after the collaboration), the psychological realm of support (cognitive, social, metacognitive, motivational, affective), the mode of support (explicit or implicit), the locus of support (direct or indirect), the target of support (group formation, domain knowledge, peer interaction, social skill; Magnisalis et al. 2011), and the type of support (guiding, challenging reflection, mirroring; Soller et al. 2005). (p. 791)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To move towards the aspired instructional framework, we must carry out rigorous empirical research and engage in related theory-building efforts. First, we need research within each individual support dimension. (p. 791)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, let us consider the dimension of mode of support. (p. 791)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Kumar et al. (2007) found that students tended to ignore adaptive prompts while collaborating. (p. 792)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third substantial challenge is to decide on the psychological realm of support to be targeted in given circumstances. Several realms can be targeted, beyond domain-level support: for instance, metacognitive support, motivational support, and support at the social level (e.g., Muldner et al. 2010; Ogan et al. 2010; Roll et al. 2011). (p. 792)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further desirable aspect of the aspired instructional framework is to allow us to better balance system adaptivity and feedback with user choice and freedom. A focus on optimizing adaptivity of ACLS runs the risk of overemphasizing the role of the system in guiding the students, rather than empowering students and teachers to make good pedagogical choices with the help of the system. More research effort should be dedicated to the adaptability of ACLS systems (i.e. the possibility for users to adjust the collaborative learning situation to their current needs or goals by making active choices). (p. 793)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion (p. 794)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructional framework we envision will be detailed and precise enough to facilitate the implementation of nuanced, highly adaptive support in educational software. Development of this framework encompasses three components: 1. The integration of theories of collaborative learning to create a comprehensive framework that, alongside data-driven models, can inform support; 2. The derivation of principles of when, how, and what support to provide, which integrate the dimensions of support, so that decisions can be made in a coordinated and transparent manner; 3. The derivation of methods for balancing adaptivity and adaptability within support. (p. 794)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Sadler1998&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadler, D. R. (1998). Formative assessment: Revisiting the territory. Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp;amp; Practice, 5(1), 77–84. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1080&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;0969595980050104&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a commentary on Black &amp;amp; Williams (1998) &amp;ndash; a review article on the effective of formative feedback on learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key argument is that students are already assessing their own work and generating their own feedback, and that higher education should build on this ability. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formative assessment refers to assessment that is specifically intended to generate feedback on performance to improve and accelerate learning (Sadler, 1998). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The construct of self-regulation refers to the degree to which students can regulate aspects of their thinking, motivation and behaviour during learning (Pintrich &amp;amp; Zusho, 2002). In practice, self-regulation is manifested in the active monitoring and regulation of a number of different learning processes, e.g. the setting of, and orientation towards, learning goals; the strategies used to achieve goals; the management of resources; the effort exerted; reactions to external feedback; the products produced. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In academic settings, specific targets, criteria, standards and other external reference points (e.g. exemplars) help define goals. Feedback is information about how the student’s present state (of learning and performance) relates to these goals and standards. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-regulated learners also actively interpret external feedback, for example, from teachers and other students, in relation to their internal goals. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how to enhance feedback (both self-generated and external) in support of self-regulation has not been fully explored in the current literature. This article helps to address this gap by proposing seven principles of good feedback practice in relation to the development of self-regulation. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rationale for rethinking formative assessment and feedback (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this shift in conceptions of teaching and learning, a parallel shift in relation to formative assessment and feedback has been slower to emerge. In higher education, formative assessment and feedback are still largely controlled by and seen as the responsibility of teachers; and feedback is still generally conceptualised as a transmission process, even though some influential researchers have recently challenged this viewpoint (Sadler, 1998; Boud, 2000; Yorke, 2003). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of problems with this transmission view when applied to formative assessment and feedback. Firstly, if formative assessment is exclusively in the hands of teachers, then it is difficult to see how students can become empowered and develop the self-regulation skills needed to prepare them for learning outside university and throughout life (Boud, 2000). Secondly, there is an assumption that when teachers transmit feedback information to students these messages are easily (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;decoded and translated into action. Yet, there is strong evidence that feedback messages are invariably complex and difficult to decipher, and that students require opportunities to construct actively an understanding of them (e.g. through discussion) before they can be used to regulate performance (Ivanic et al., 2000; Higgins et al., 2001). Thirdly, viewing feedback as a cognitive process involving only transfer of information ignores the way feedback interacts with motivation and beliefs. Research shows that feedback both regulates and is regulated by motivational beliefs. External feedback has been shown to influence how students feel about themselves (positively or negatively), and what and how they learn (Dweck, 1999). Research also shows (Garcia, 1995) that beliefs can regulate the effects of feedback messages (e.g. perceptions of self-efficacy might be maintained by reinterpreting the causes of failure). Fourthly, as a result of this transmission view of feedback, the workload of teachers in higher education increases year by year as student numbers and class sizes become larger. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key feature of the model that differentiates it from everyday understandings of feedback is that students are assumed to occupy a central and active role in all feedback processes. They are always actively involved in monitoring and regulating their own performance, both in relation to desired goals and in terms of the strategies used to reach these goals. The student also actively constructs his or her own understanding of feedback messages derived from external sources (Black &amp;amp; Wiliam, 1998; Ivanic et al., 2000). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conceptual model of self-regulation outlined in this article draws on earlier work by Butler and Winne (1995). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conceptual model of processes of self-regulation and internal feedback (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is considerable research evidence to show that effective feedback leads to learning gains. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black and Wiliam (1998) drew together over 250 studies of feedback carried out since 1988, spanning all educational sectors. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis of these studies revealed that feedback produced significant benefits in learning and achievement across all content areas, knowledge and skill types, and levels of education. While the bulk of Black and Wiliam’s data came from the school sector, their review and that of others (e.g. Hattie, 1987; Crooks, 1988), provides convincing evidence of the value of feedback in promoting learning. In addition, there is a large body of complementary research studies demonstrating the effects of self and peer feedback on learning (e.g. Boud, 1995; Boud et al., 1999). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadler identified three conditions necessary for students to benefit from feedback in academic tasks. He argued that the student must know: 1. what good performance is (i.e. the student must possess a concept of the goal or standard being aimed for); 2. how current performance relates to good performance (for this, the student must be able to compare current and good performance); 3. how to act to close the gap between current and good performance. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;teachers should focus much more effort on strengthening the skills of self-assessment in their students (Boud, 2000; Yorke, 2003). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is assumed that students can selfregulate internal states and behaviour as well as some aspects of the environment, this does not mean that the student always has full control. Learning tasks set by teachers, marking regimes and other course requirements are not under students’ control, even though students still have latitude to self-regulate within such constraints. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they are more persistent, resourceful, confident and higher achievers (Pintrich, 1995; Zimmerman &amp;amp; Schunk, 2001). Also, the more learning becomes self-regulated, the more students assume control over their learning, and the less dependent they are on external teacher support when they engage in regulatory activities (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Schunk, 2004). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven principles of good feedback practice: facilitating self-regulation (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps clarify what good performance is (goals, criteria, expected standards); 2. facilitates the development of self-assessment (reflection) in learning; 3. delivers high quality information to students about their learning; 4. encourages teacher and peer dialogue around learning; 5. encourages positive motivational beliefs and self-esteem; 6. provides opportunities to close the gap between current and desired performance; 7. provides information to teachers that can be used to help shape teaching. (p. 8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This chapter provides an interesting and thorough overview of the historical context of activity theory. Understanding the historical circumstance of this theory is important for any use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legitimacy of activity theory as a unified theory has been the subject of various discussions. Holzman (2006), for example, argues that there is no unified perspective on activity theory (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An emphasis on psychological approaches without consideration of anthropological, sociological, historical, and linguistic characteristics of activity is risky and narrows the focus to the study of specific and limited aspects of activity . (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;beginning in the 1930s when Leont’ev formulated its basic principles and proposed the structure of activity. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This historical circumstance has given rise to the promi- nence of activity theory in psychology. Today, however, activity theory is redefining itself and proving its generative potential across a wide range of disciplines and fields of social practice. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;activity the- ory addresses the foundational theoretical issue of activity as the primary unit of analysis and, thus, provides both a theory of human activity and a productive method for its study. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Engeström envi- sions a different future for the field, proposing that “the current expansive reconstruction of activity theory will actually lead to a new type of the- ory. Essential to this emerging theory is multivoicedness coexisting with monism ” (Engeström , 1999a, p. 20). (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One distinctive theoretical feature of activity theory , for example, concerns the issue of change . As Minnis and John-Steiner (2001) argue, “The delineating factor [between activity theory and the theories dominant in Western psychology and sociology] is that activity theory requires a systematic examination of change . This can be done by provoking, facilitating, and documenting change ” (p. 308). (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory is grounded in the lineage of Leont’ev’s works and recognizes a unifying thread between the works of Leont’ev and other Russian scholars, such as Vygotsky, Luria , Meshcheryakov, and Davydov. This thread may be articulated as follows: Not only is activity an abstract principle of explanation or a general theoretical notion; it is a concept that denotes the basic unit of concrete human life. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE CONCEPT OF ACTIVITY AS THE CORE (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;human life is fundamen - tally rooted in participation in human activities that are oriented (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;toward objects. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object-oriented activities , then, are the core of activity theory and distinguish it from other approaches. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we wish to highlight an important difference between sociocultural approaches and activity theory . As a unit of analysis , a focus on action does not account for the historical continuity and longevity of human life. Activity theory conceptualizes actions in the broader perspective of their systemic and motivational context and, thus, aims at going beyond a given situation. The emphasis on action a lone does not f u l fi l l t he resea rch agenda in activity theory, according to which actions are studied in historically evolving collective activities . (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the boundaries of the field of activity theory are defined by two distinctive features. First, activity theory is a practice-based theory. Second, it is a historical and future-oriented theory. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory involves the researcher throughout the course of the development, stagnation, or regression of the activities under scrutiny, as well as in the activities of the research sub- jects. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ON THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THEORY AND PR ACTICE (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proclaimed prac - tice turn can be traced back to Marx’s idea of revolutionary practice , in which theory is not only meant to analyze and explain the world, but also to facilitate practices and promote changes. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within activity theory, even the most theoretically oriented represen- tative – the philosopher Il’enkov – grounded his philosophy in the edu- cational practices in the boarding school directed by Meshcheryakov in Zagorsk for children with multisensory impairment. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory , as a practice-based theory , is grounded in practice both theoretically and concretely. On this basis, we argue that the very nature of activity theory relies on establishing a bridge between theory and practice. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ON THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PAST, THE PR ESENT, AND THE FUTUR E (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory is based on the collective heritage of the founders, in partic- ular Vygotsky , Luria , and Leont’ev . (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This collective contribution stands in contrast to other approaches typically (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;based on a single individual’s endeavors – for example, psychoanalysis on Freud’s works and genetic epistemology on Piaget’s works. Also, activity theory has the distinctive characteristic of developing as an integral part of the periods of historical turmoil in which activity theorists have lived. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia had been ruled for centuries by despots, and thus the revolution was a unique historical turn for the country. For a large number of artists, intellectuals, and academics, it meant a unique opportunity to build a new society. They became completely involved in this cause, exhilarated that they were sharing the vision of a better world (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A need to make sense of historical turmoil was the driving force behind the forma- tion of what was to become activity theory. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until 1990, when the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the legacy of Stalinism continued and the state system Stalin built continued to be based on coercion and extreme control. Activity theory, then, must necessarily be understood in the context of this complex historical framework. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student movement in Europe in the 1960s gave rise to a renewed interest in activity theory. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these years between the late 1960s and 1970s, activity theory was introduced in the West. Progressive academics like Urie Bronfenbrenner , Jerome Bruner , and Michael Cole brought the works of the founders to American academic circles. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, activity theory is one that develops as an integral part of the historical turmoil in which activity theorists live. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Engeström wrote ( 1999a), “ Activity theory has the conceptual and methodological potential to be a pathbreaker in studies that help humans gain control over their own artifacts and thus over their future” (p. 29). (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENGESTRöM’S WORK AS A PROMOTER OF T HESE DIALOGUES (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identify four main phases in Engeström’s development as an activity theorist.1 These cycles are interrelated and their historical boundaries are not well defined: (1) the European student movement of the 1960s and the discovery of activity theory; (2) the study of instruction and the turn from school learning to workplace learning; (3) developmental work research and the theory of expansive learning; and (4) the formation of activity- theoretical communities aimed at changing societal practices. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 1960s and during most of the 1970s, Engeström produced a set of works stemming directly from his participation in the student movement . (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engeström’s search for pedagogical ideas emanated from the Soviet Union and East Germany, most notably L e ont ’e v ’s Problems of the Development of the Mind, published in East Germany in 1973 (Leontjew, 1973) (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first phase of investigation culminated in Engeström’s (1979) thesis, The Imagination and Behavior of School Students Analyzed from the Viewpoint of Education for Peace (in Finnish), in which he first makes extensive use of activity the- ory . (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study reinforced his initial frustration at not being able to pro- vide tangible alternatives to the instructional practices of that time. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second phase of Engeström’s development as an activity theorist was an intense period starting at the end of 1970s, in which he devoted his work to the study of instruction with the explicit aim of promoting changes in school practices. (p. 36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third phase in Engeström’s work concerns the birth of developmen- tal work research , conceived in parallel with the elaboration of the theory of expansive learning. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engeström’s main argument in Learning by Expanding (1987) is that this kind of learning can be seen in full maturity in the transformation of work. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Learning by Expanding , we also see Il’enkov’s influence on Engeström in his adoption of the concept of contradictions. The triangular model of activity systems (Engeström , 1987, p. 78), present in embryonic form in early texts (Engeström , 1983; Engeström , Hakkarainen , &amp;amp; Hedegaard , 1984), was further theorized within the development of the theory of expansive learning. The visual representation of the triangle was a way to condense and convey theory in research collaborations with practitioners. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus, the triangle emerged as a tool designed to destroy the myth of direct- ness in learning and teaching, and to overcome the dualism in existing traditional theories based on subject–object, learner–knowledge, and indi- vidual–environment relations.&lt;/strong&gt; Significantly, the triangular representation is a direct result of the researcher’s dialogue with practice. It is important to note that in Engeström’s study of cleaners (Engeström &amp;amp; Engeström, 1984), Vygotsky’s simple triangular representation was successfully used as a basis for making the distinction between object and tool. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth phase of Engeström’s work can be characterized as an ongoing effort to initiate communities into the use and development of activity the- ory for changing societal practices. (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main influence of Engeström’s work on society has occurred through the research projects and partnerships of the Center for Activity Theory and (p. 38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developmental Work Research . (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief historical account of Yrjö Engeström’s work illustrates the development and application of activity theory through the life of an activity theorist. For Engeström, as for the founders of activity theory, theoretical developments require activist involvement in concrete human practices. In constant dialogue with the activity-theoretical classic heri- tage – in particular that of Vygotsky , Leont’ev, Ilyenkov, and Davydov – Engeström’s work addresses the pressing societal challenges of change and learning in work activities. (p. 39)&lt;/p&gt;

Journal of the Learning Sciences, 25(4), 599–633. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1080/10508406.2016.1204547&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/10508406.2016.1204547&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: A very nicely (and also densely written) paper presenting three cases of expansive learning. It highlights six theoretical lens to be used in analysis of expansive learning. The cases are from two schools and a university library. Formative interventions are also compared with design-based research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article examines formative interventions as we understand them in cultural- historical activity theory and reflects on key differences between this intervention research tradition and design-based research as it is conceived in the learning sciences tradition. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together these cases illustrate that an activity-theoretical formative intervention approach differs from design- based research in the following ways: (a) formative interventions are based on design done by the learners; (b) the collective design effort is seen as part of an expansive learning process including participatory analyses and implementation phases; &amp;copy; rather than aiming at transferable and scalable solutions, formative interventions aim at generative solutions developing over lengthy periods of time both in the researched activities and in the research community. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural-historical activity theory has from the very beginning been an activist and interventionist approach (Sannino, 2011). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call these methods formative interventions (Engeström, 2011). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as one of us has argued before (Engeström, 2011), the emphasis on completeness, finality, and closure in much of the central literature on design-based research makes it difficult to take the agency of the learners as a foundational point of departure in this research tradition. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas Brown innovatively advocated the collaborative role of participants in design experiments, we seek to take a step further, seeing ourselves as interven- ing in design processes of which we cannot possibly be the engineers in control. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In formative interventions, the design is driven by historically formed contradictions (Engeström &amp;amp; Sannino, 2011) in the learners’ activities and is the result of learners’ collective efforts to understand and face these contra- dictions and the problems they engender. The collective design effort is itself the core of an expansive learning process, involving reconceptualization and practical transformation of the object of the learners’ activity. For this process to occur, the involvement of a researcher-interventionist is not essential. Collectives conduct formative interventions on themselves to address unsus- tainable contradictions and transform their activities— we call such efforts intraventions. When researcher-interventionists are part of the process, their role is to intervene by provoking and supporting the process led and owned by the learners. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we focus on a formative intervention method called the Change Laboratory or CL (Engeström et al., 1996; Virkkunen &amp;amp; Newnham, 2013). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CL intervention typically consists of 6 to 12 weekly sessions that last for about 2 hr each, with one or more subsequent follow-up sessions. In the CL sessions, participants and researcher-interventionists use a set of representational devices designed for jointly analyzing disturbances and contradictions in their activities and for developing new solutions. The conceptual tools of the CL are derived from two epistemological principles, namely, the principle of double stimulation and the principle of ascending from the abstract to the concrete (Sannino, 2011). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;successful CLs lead to outcomes that cannot be fully anticipated by the interven- tionist. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we aim to address three key questions to highlight the unique nature of formative interventions: 1. In which ways were the objects of the activities practically transformed in the three formative interventions? 2. What methods of data analysis were developed and used in the two CL cases, and what do these methods yield in terms of moving forward our understanding of formative interventions? 3. What kinds of indications of the generative potential of formative inter- ventions may be identified in the two CL cases? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We begin by clarifying the specific activity- theoretical meaning of the terms object, expansive learning, and agency, referred to but not fully explained in the introduction. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object of activity is a central concept in this framework, because different kinds of activity are distinguished by their objects. In English, the word object does not convey the crucial difference between an arbitrary thing out there and an entity at which activities are directed. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, the object has drawing power and refers to something at which human efforts are directed. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of its link to human needs, an object is a historically developing entity that is never fully attained or complete. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in KB, an idea as an object of the &amp;lsquo;activity&amp;rsquo;.  (it needs to be clarified activity in AT is different from what KB is traditionally criticizing. ) (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object is a cultural (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single actor can only grasp some aspects of the object, so it is typically difficult to articulate by an individual. An object is contested and often also fragmented. Moreover, an object carries in itself the pervasive contradictions of its given socioeconomic forma- tion. In capitalism any object is at least potentially a contradictory unity of use value and exchange value. The deep-seated contradictions in objects make them dynamic and unpredictable. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the object - collectively understood -&amp;gt; community discourse. contradictions within the object -&amp;gt; very interesting.. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and collective construct that has a long historical half-life. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expansive learning (Engeström, 2015) distinguishes itself by its focus on learning within and between activities in society at large, beyond the confines of school. Expansive learning is a creative type of learning in which learners join their forces to literally create something novel, essentially learning something that does not yet exist. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metaphor of expansion depicts the multidirectional movement of learners constructing and implementing a new, wider, and more complex object for their activity. This is done with the help of mediating means used and built throughout the design process. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transformative agency is a quality of expansive learning. Learning expan- sively requires breaking away from the given frame of action and taking the initiative to transform it. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is so like KB, which refers to epistemic agency. Transformative agency makes it even more explicit that agency is geared towards being transformative.  (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object-centered expansive learning and transformative agency are pursued through formative interventions by mobilizing procedures and analyses based on the epistemological principles of double stimulation and ascending from the abstract to the concrete. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the idea of ascending from the abstract to the concrete &amp;ndash; is it aligned with objectifying ideas? not sure. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double stimulation is a principle of volition and agency (Sannino, 2015; Vygotsky, 1987) that underlies the procedures and analyses of formative inter- ventions. This principle is highlighted in Vygotsky’ s(1997) work on the devel- opment of children and clinical patients. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than giving a child a task, ignoring the way she reinterpreted it, and then observing how she behaved, Vygotsky and his collea- gues typically also gave the child potentially useful mediating artifacts— tools or signs. The action of the child to take up and use these mediational means (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;radically changed the nature of the task and eventually revealed potential cap- abilities and emerging new psychological formations of the child. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky (1987) used the example of a waiting experiment to illustrate double stimulation. In this procedure, a subject is left in a room to wait for an experiment to begin, but no one comes and nothing happens. Facing a conflict and oscillating between the urge to leave and the commitment to stay, the subject is at first paralyzed. The subject then identifies an external artifact, such as the clock on the wall, and turns it into a crucial sign: “ When the hand moves to the vertical position, I will leave.” After this, execution of the action of leaving happens as if automatically. In double stimulation, the first stimulus is the problematic situa- tion, which triggers a paralyzing conflict of motives. In trying to cope with the problem, actors use artifacts that serve the function of meaningful signs. These signs are second stimuli, with the help of which the subjects can gain control of and transform the problematic situation. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example highlights the fact that a conflict of motives plays a key role in double stimulation. If conflicts of motives and agency are disregarded, double stimulation is easily reduced to just another term for the general notion of mediation (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle of ascending from the abstract to the concrete is foundational in dialectical thinking. In activity theory, Davydov (1990, 2008), inspired by Ilyenkov (1982), turned this principle into a theory of learning and into an interventionist approach for changing school instruction. The most well-known example is Davydov’ s work on elementary school mathematics learning. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to understanding the principle of ascending to the concrete is the concept of a germ cell. The most well-known example of a germ cell is the commodity in Marx’ s theory of capitalism (Ilyenkov, 1982): Every commodity is a contra- dictory unity of use value and exchange value. For Davydov, the germ cell of mathematics is the real number, which is a particular case of a general relation- ship of quantities, where one of them is taken as a measure for computing the other. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By ascending from the abstract to the concrete, one can attain a rich recon- ceptualization of the object of activity. This is a process that goes beyond mere observation and categorization. It consists of practical experimentation with a problematic situation, connecting it to its genetic-historical origins and abstract- ing from it an explanatory basic relation, also called germ cell. A germ cell abstraction is a unity of opposites. This internally contradictory unity can gen- erate complex, theoretically mastered concrete developments. The germ cell is expansive in that it opens up rich and diverse possibilities of explanation, practical application, and creative solutions (Engeström, Nummijoki, &amp;amp; Sannino, 2012 (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In formative interventions the researcher-interventionists offer participants theo- retical and methodological resources to engage in practical experimentations that can lead to generative, novel outcomes, which we would term theoretically mastered concrete developments. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of generativity is not new in the learning sciences. In the 1970s Wittrock (1974) saw learning as a process of generating meaningful relations among concepts and between knowledge and experience. Formative interven- tions foster “ generative reasoning” (Greeno, 1989, p. 313) by means of con- structing germ cell ideas. The learners ascend to the concrete by generating novel implementations and extensions of the germ cell. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the analysis of the three cases, we use six conceptual lenses derived from the core epistemological principles in our theoretical framework, that is, the principle of double stimulation and the principle of ascending from the abstract to the concrete. These six conceptual lenses are (a) first stimulus, (b) conflict of motives, &amp;copy; second stimuli, (d) practical experimentation, (e) germ cell, and (f) theoretically mastered concrete developments. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aims at answering our first research question: How was the object of activity formed? (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six conceptual lenses are obviously intertwined and cannot be presented in a mechanical order without distorting the dynamics of the actual intervention. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so we need more dynamic analytical devices. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the six conceptual lenses, we analyze the two CL cases in order to answer our second and third research questions: What methodological devel- opments took place, and what indications of generativity can be identified? (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASE 1: INTRAVENTION IN A FAVELA SCHOOL (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first case concerns a change initiative undertaken in a school located in a favela, a shantytown in south São Paulo, Brazil. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the well-being of the community became the object of change efforts and expansive learning. The trash is a concrete instantiation of the evolving object of the school’ s activity. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, after the local initiative by the two coordinators had been under way for some time, the third author of this article began to observe and document the local change effort without acting as an interventionist. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data consisted of documents produced by the participants, interviews, and observation periods on site, supported by photographs and video recordings. The initial analysis was conducted in a temporal and narrative mode by constructing a thick description of the events and participants’ reflections on them along a timeline. In this article, the initial narrative is interpreted and condensed through the conceptual lenses introduced in our conceptual framework. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen in terms of the principle of double stimulation, the flood and its consequences were the first stimulus, posing a serious problem and threat to the population and school. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same context the coordinators constructed a new educational management plan that served as a second stimulus to find a way out. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practical experimentations in line with the principle of ascending from the abstract to the concrete were initiated with the help of the new management plan. These included organizing a student relay race on the flood site; meetings in the neighborhood health care center; debates on how the community could deal with trash; (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school also produced a film and organized a movie session inviting the community to watch themselves in an improvised theater in the same street where the river overflows. In the school, the teachers worked with the river issue in classrooms connecting it with the curricula of their different subjects. Eventually the experimentations led to a manifesto titled My Stream, My Life, compiled by the leading pedagogical coordinator from materials produced during these events with the community. This manifesto became the germ cell for sustained and expanding transformation efforts (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manifesto as a germ cell captures the essence of a new, emerging object. The passage from the manifesto and the paradoxical expression “ trash is life” convey the generative expansive potential of practical experimentations through which an entire community became aware of its own rights and acquired con- fidence that it could make a difference. The manifesto gave continuity and meaning to numerous further efforts by the community to improve its life. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what sense was this a formative intervention? Formative interventions, including intraventions, aim at transforming the participants’ vital collective activities (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nterventions happen when people try to transform activities— their own or others’— in some deliberate and systematic ways. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASE 2: A CL IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1998, a research group1 conducted an 11-week CL intervention with the teachers of a middle school located in Jakomäki, a disadvantaged area of Helsinki, Finland (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In weekly 2-hr sessions, with the help of conceptual tools from activity theory, the teachers discussed and analyzed videotaped problem situations and accounts from their daily experiences. By putting the problems in a historical perspective, they identified present developmental challenges in the activity of the school. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this basis, the teachers constructed a vision for the school’ s future and designed six sets of practical changes as immediate steps toward their vision. The teachers implemented the changes during the winter and spring of 1999 and continued to do so in the 1999– 2000 school year.2 (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We examine in particular the impact of this innovation on the transformation of the object of the teachers’ work activity— the students and their learning. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the CL sessions, members of the research group spent about 2 months collecting ethnographic data in the school. Samples from these data, mainly in the form of recorded interviews and videotaped interactions inside and outside classrooms, were selected and presented to the participants as first stimuli in the early sessions of the intervention. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox was that apathetic students are relatively easy to control, but active and energetic students may pose a risk. Many participants experienced and expressed this as a conflict of motives: Should students be trusted or controlled? (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researcher-interventionists invited the participants to analyze the histor- ical roots of their current troubles and to model different developmental phases of the school. This was done by dividing the teachers into groups according to the decade in which they had started working at the school: the 1970s group, the 1980s group, the 1990s group, and the newcomer group. Each group worked out a description of the schoolwork and its contradictions in the respective decade. In these accounts, the emergence of student apathy was connected to socioeconomic changes in the community. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step in the CL was the envisioning of the future model of the activity. Each one of the teachers was asked to take home a copy of the general model of an activity system (Engeström, 2015, p. 63) and to fill the template with features that would describe the teacher’ s vision of how the school should function in the future. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This three-phase vision functioned as the second stimulus in the intervention. In itself the three-phase vision was not a solution to the conflict of motives; it was an instrument with the help of which a concrete solution could be constructed. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the seventh session of the CL, the teachers selected concrete issues for their immediate change efforts. A taskforce group of interested teachers took respon- sibility for each of the six issues. P (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we see it, these practical experimentations paved the way for the formulation and implementation of the final project as germ cell. It soon became clear that, among the issues selected as foci of practical experimentation, the final project was the most ambitious spearhead of change. It involved all of the teachers and was also enthusiastically accepted by an assembly of student representatives. The final project taskforce discussed the relationship between the vision (second stimulus) and the emerging germ cell innovation, and it is noteworthy that the participants defined the final project as a change that represented the middle-range vision, not merely the short-term improvements. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final project attempted to go beyond deep-seated constraints in school instruction. It allowed the students and required the teachers to operate beyond and across the encapsulated school subjects. It allowed the students and required the teachers to work on a long-term basis, preparing final projects over a whole semester, thus going beyond the temporal punctuation of lessons and tests. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most important, the final project introduced work motivated by the pride of achieving something beyond the obligatory demands of the curriculum. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point of view, the final project may be seen as a germ cell— a small but potentially expansive change capsule. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immigrant students ’ teachers were strongly in favor of involving their students in the final project and argued this positive orientation with the help of insights from their own current and prior experiences of working with them. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ascending to the concrete goes beyond the practical implementations of the final project. When implemented, this germ cell had the potential to change the way in which the teachers constructed their object, the students, and their learning. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the Intervention (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When teachers talk about their students, they talk about and categorize the object of their work. A major research goal of the analysis of the Jakomäki case was to discover changes in the overall profile of the categories that the teachers used to evaluate students, the object of their activity (Engeström, Engeström, &amp;amp; Suntio, 2002a). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he analytical procedure focus on changes that occurred over time in very basic, typically dichotomous categorizations. For this a method called longitudinal categorization analysis was developed. Related to ethnomethodological membership categorization analysis (Hester &amp;amp; Eglin, 1997; Lepper, 2000; Stokoe, 2012), longitudinal categorization analysis is aimed at identifying durable sea changes in a community rather than minute short-term variations in individuals or small groups. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to isolate statements corresponding to such categories, researchers coded transcripts of the teachers’ recorded conversations in 11 discussion (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sessions into 256 topical sequences, out of which 161 were focused on students. These 161 sequences were further coded as either positive or negative. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of analysis yields a picture of what happened after a CL intervention in the basic orientation of a working community. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 11- month period of data collection was divided into seven phases. The analysis showed a progressive shift toward predominantly positive talk about the students (see Figure 1). The shift did not happen abruptly. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that negative talk did not disappear. In other words, the emergence of positive talk about students was truly an expansion and enrichment of the repertoire; it did not emerge at the cost of previous ways of talking. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generativity (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indications of generativity in the CL intervention at Jakomäki middle school may be observed following the three dimensions presented in our theoretical frame- work: local continuity, domain appropriation, and method appropriation. Local continuity was manifested in the decision of the teachers to engage in a second round of CL intervention in 2000– 2001. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method appropriation may be observed as well. The methodological insight of tracing the evolution of negative and positive categorizations of students was further pursued and developed by Sannino (2010a), Virkkunen et al. (2012), and Rainio and Hofmann (2015). (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sannino ’ s(2008) analysis of such breaking-out actions in the Jakomäki school intervention led to the first typification of expressions of (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;transformative agency, which was subsequently elaborated into a method of analysis of formative intervention processes in its own right (Haapasaari, Enges- tröm, &amp;amp; Kerosuo, 2014; Vänninen, Pereira Querol, &amp;amp; Engeström, 2015). (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASE 3: A CL IN AN ACADEMIC LIBRARY (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Intervention (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2010, a CRADLE research team3 conducted a CL in the City Center Campus Library of the University of Helsinki. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ working hypothesis was that research groups do in fact need new kinds of library services to master large and complex sets of data as well as the demands of information searching, electronic publishing, evaluating one’ s own research, and maintaining visibility in the scientific community. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the present object of the library’ s work with researchers was an individual researcher’ s discrete request for publications or publication-related information. The new object would be a long-term partnership with a research group needing support in managing data, publishing, and following the global flow of publications. This new object would require a new division of labor, new competences, and a new organization model for the library. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researcher-interventionists suggested knotworking (Engeström et al., 1999) as a preliminary characterization of the new type of work needed in the library. In knotworking, services would be coconstructed and continuously reconfigured in flexibly changing collaborative formations or partnerships between librarians and research groups. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key managers and staff members of the library quickly adopted the idea of knotworking as a second stimulus for the change effort. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prior analysis (Engeström, 2013) showed an interesting increase in the frequencies of the use of the terms knot and knotworking starting halfway through the CL and culminating in the last two sessions of the intervention. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of knot took shape as a tension-laden unity of turning inward to pool and combine the competences of staff in flexible ways— and turning outward to manage partnerships with research groups. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the Intervention (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary research goal of the analysis of the library case was to gain a firmer understanding of the dynamics of expansive learning that occurs in the CL. The data consisted of transcripts of the videotaped discussions in the eight CL sessions. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4,184 speaking turns (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, a specific method was developed called analysis of expansive learning actions and deviations from instructional intentions. The method has its roots in Davydov’ s work on the learning actions involved in the process of ascending from the abstract to the concrete (Davydov, 2008). (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a typology of seven expansive learning actions (Engeström &amp;amp; Sannino, 2010): (a) questioning, criticizing, or rejecting some aspects of accepted practices and existing wisdom; (b) analyzing problematic situations by tracing their origins and evolution (genetic-historical analysis) or by constructing a representation of the inner systemic relations of the activity (actual– empirical analysis); &amp;copy; modeling the newly found explanatory relationship in some pub- licly observable and transmittable medium; (d) examining the model in practical experimentations aimed at fully grasping its dynamics, potentials, and limita- tions; (e) implementing the model by means of practical applications, enrich- ments, and conceptual extensions; (f) reflecting on and evaluating the process; and (g) consolidating the outcomes toward a new stable activity. These learning actions also serve as a general model for the interventionists’ instructional intentions in a CL. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to identify the deviations, it was necessary to specify the instructional intentions of the researcher-interventionists. For this, the written plans of the interventionists as well as recordings of the planning discussions of the inter- ventionist group were used (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis yields a picture of the dynamics of learning with the CL intervention. It reveals to what extent the seven expansive learning actions were actually taken in the process, to what extent they formed cyclic patterns, and to what extent deviations from instructional intentions took place. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the CL transcripts shows that six of the seven expansive learning actions occurred in the data, the most frequent ones being the action of analyzing the situation and the action of modeling, followed by the action of examining the new model and the action of questioning (see Figure 2). (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s interesting these analyses of expansive learning take the form of a simple line chart. some claims made here might be circular - findings led by design. The richness of writing is here but the presentation of coding results looks simple/simplistic. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of these findings, expansive learning emerges as a process inter- spersed with frequent nonexpansive actions, some supportive, some neutral, some digressing, some also adverse to expansion. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 summarizes the findings of our inquiry. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the first research question, in each one of the three interven- tions, learners expansively transformed the object of their activity. In the intra- vention in Brazil, the standard object of school instruction— students and the knowledge prescribed in the curriculum— was radically opened up. Students and school knowledge became embedded in the broader object of quality of life in the community, epitomized by the river and the trash. In the middle school CL, the expansion of the object was focused on the students: Apathetic students were reconceptualized as capable and potentially competent. This expanded view of students was epitomized in the students’ possibility to raise their grades by producing a competent final project. In the university library CL, the anonymous researchers as recipients of routine services and associated instructions were reconceptualized as collaboration partners in need of complex, jointly designed services. This expansion was epitomized in the successful effort to make research services a fully acknowledged and supported key function of the library. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formative interventions are expansive learning processes in which learners willfully reconceptualize and practically transform the object of their activity to face its unsustainable historically formed contradictions. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TABLE 1 Summary of Findings From the Analyses of the Three Interventions (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;provoke and support the expansion of the object of the learners’ activity by mobilizing concepts and principles stemming from cultural-historical activity theory. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second question concerns the methods of analysis developed to examine CL processes. We have discussed two such methods, namely, the longitudinal categorization analysis and the analysis of expansive learning actions and devia- tions from instructional intentions. Other methods developed specifically to analyze entire CL processes include the analysis of discursive manifestations of contradictions (Engeström &amp;amp; Sannino, 2011) and the analysis of expressions of transformative agency (Haapasaari et al., 2014; Vänninen et al., 2015). (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do formative interventions such as the ones discussed here differ from design-based research in the learning sciences tradition? An activity-theoretical formative intervention approach is distinctive in three ways: (a) Formative interventions are based on design done by the learners; (b) the collective design effort is seen as part of an expansive learning process including participatory analyses4 and implementation phases; and &amp;copy; rather than aiming at transferable and scalable solutions (Clarke &amp;amp; Dede, 2009; Fishman, Marx, Blumenfeld, Krajcik, &amp;amp; Soloway, 2004), formative interventions aim at generative solutions developing over comparatively lengthy periods of time both in the researched activities and in the research community.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we find that student annotations and writing on Lacuna give instructors more insight into students’ perspectives on texts and course materials. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visibility of shared annotations encourages students to take on a more active role as peer instructors and peer learners. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching with Lacuna (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no single way to teach using Lacuna—or any social annotation tool, for that matter. Of the dozen or more instructors who have used the Lacuna at Stanford and other institutions, each has made his or her own instructional design choices about how deeply to integrate the platform into course activities. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the “light integration” end of the spectrum, some instructors used Lacuna as the equivalent of a course reader . (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the “deep integration” end of the spectrum, instructors read students’ annotations and responses in advance of class and integrated them into class discussion; in these courses, a minimum number of annotations per week were often expected and counted towards a participation score. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, “Futurity” exemplifies the ways in which social annotation tools like Lacuna can be intentionally used by instructors to create a more student-centered and learning-centered humanities seminar. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Futurity” Course (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2015 course required 20 annotations per week from each student. This was reduced from the previous year’s requirements based on student feedback indicating that higher requirements led to annotating in order to get a good grade, rather than annotating as a way of increasing comprehension and engagement. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across 10 students, the course participants ranged from postdoctoral fellows in philosophy , to graduate students in comparative literature, to undergraduates in the interdisciplinary Science, Technology, and Society (STS) major, under which Futurity was cross-listed. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our key research questions was how the visibility of students’ reading with Lacuna changed instructor practices. For Eshel and Johnsrud, a simple yet powerful shift was the ease of ascertaining which students had done the reading and how well they had understood the texts—questions which, as many instructors know, can consume considerable classroom time and assessment work (such as reading quizzes or short reading response papers). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visible annotations also changed the focus of class preparation. Johnsrud described his and Eshel’s process of preparing for class with Lacuna as akin to drawing a Venn diagram, where one circle represented the students’ interests, as evidenced by annotations and responses, and the other was the topics that the instructors wanted to cover. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining students’ online work in advance of class sessions (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eshel and Johnsrud also used annotations to get to know their students as readers and thinkers. Johnsrud said, “After Week 1, I could tell you so much about each student, how they think, what they struggle with, what kind of level they are at, that had nothing to do with any class behavior.” (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to encouraging responses and dialogue among and between students, deliberate integration of online discussion into the classroom also appeared to have a democratizing effect. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular in-class discussion illustrates a few of the practices of integrating social annotations into the classroom. By using Lacuna as a window into students’ reading, Eshel and Johnsrud were able to pinpoint the exact places in the text that generated the most frustration, confusion, or disagreement in their students. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Week 5 class session also demonstrates a type of negotiation that can take place between the students’ interests and the instructors’ instructional agenda in classes that integrate Lacuna into the classroom conversation. Throughout the conversation, the instructors attempted to steer the conversation away from the shortcomings of the essay and toward the reasons they had had the students read it. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning with Lacuna (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the online reading experience like for students? Across surveys of students in Futurity and six other courses using Lacuna (N=45), digital annotation with Lacuna appears to have both benefits and drawbacks (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the students surveyed, annotation was a familiar strategy which they used frequently, according to self-reported habits. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was social annotation, however, that emerged through the surveys as the most salient aspect of Lacuna, compared to both paper and digital reading environments. In open text responses describing their experiences, students reported an appreciation of the opportunity to hear one another’s perspectives and learn from one another as well as from the instructor. This was particularly true for less advanced students in courses (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents also emphasized that timing matters when it comes to the social experience. For example, one student said he was usually the first to read and comment, so he didn’t have the opportunity to experience others’ annotation unless he took the time to return to the text after class. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring Social Annotation from the Student Perspective (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W ith Lacuna, however, they each noted that the platform allowed them to annotate more extensively than they were accustomed to doing on paper. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more salient, however, were the ways that the platform created a stronger sense of community and new opportunities for social learning. Jenna eloquently expressed the connection to other course participants that the platform enabled her to feel: “It’s like all of our head space is kind of in the same area. [&amp;hellip;] I’ll just be like oh, this is what Amanthi was thinking when she read this part. How interesting, it’s a Sunday afternoon and we’re both reading this. [&amp;hellip;] It’s like there is constant fluidity, between when I’m in class and outside of class.” (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collegial nature of the course community appeared to be a crucial element for supporting peer learning. “I have learned just as much from my peers in the course as [from] my instructors,” Jenna noted at two different points in her interview. She described social reading as an additive process, where her own understanding of the text was enhanced by the perspectives of others: “That’s the beauty of it. It’s because we have all of these minds bringing together these very fragmented understandings of the text. Then it just only adds to yours.” (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;king the social annotation process that enables this more complete understanding, however , reveals multiple opportunities for an individual to engage socially, or alternatively, remain solitary in their interpretive process. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explored in the Marshall and Brush (2004) research, the first decision in social annotation whether to share at all. For some students this appears to be a more sensitive issue than for others (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the quarter progressed in Futurity, sharing was the norm, rather than the exception. This was due in part to the default setting of “public” on annotations, which meant that students needed to check a box to intentionally opt out of sharing each time they hit “save” on an annotation. Over time, students also had more practice exposing their opinions without negative feedback. Another incentive may have been the instructors’ use of annotations and students’ written responses in the classroom discussion. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other reasons that students shared their annotations were because they “didn’t care” (Jenna) if someone saw what they wrote—perhaps a typical perspective from the social media generation (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of social annotation is choosing to read others’ annotations. In the interviews, it became clear that in the dialogue taking place through social annotation, not all utterances are necessarily “heard” by others. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussing what made a “good” annotation, Jenna and Allegra generally focused on the informational content and novelty of the annotation. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these examples, a vital aspect of social annotation becomes evident: the act of annotating has multiple goals and as a result, there are multiple ways to understand whether annotation is a productive utterance in the online discourse community. Social annotation is a way of reading simultaneously for oneself and for the community. The individual reader, traditionally ensconced in a paper book, thinks entirely of himself. With social annotation, a diverse audience emerges—an audience including an instructor who is in a position of evaluation and other students who can be “told” new information. Moreover, both instructors and students are fellow participants in a dialogue which can be carried out in class as well as online. Finally, the reader is also an audience member herself, for the performances of others in her class. The mental model of the activity of social annotation, then, is multifaceted, requiring a level of self-awareness (and other-awareness) significantly beyond that of being a private reader. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this summary is really good (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oncluding Remarks (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;equipping learners to engage individually and collectively with texts across media, Lacuna and other social annotation platforms are designed to encourage critical thinking and sensemaking, skills which are at the core of disciplinary work in the humanities and vital to 21st-century citizenship. Critical reading has long been a hallmark of the humanities and a skill which the traditional seminar has sought to foster in its students; however, the practice itself has often been all but invisible to instructors. By transforming reading into an activity that is done socially, rather than in solitude, Lacuna created a bridge between the physical classroom and online reading space in Futurity. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But dialogue isn’t always easy. Social annotation appears to create new demands on students and instructors alike to negotiate one another’s perspectives and reflect on the goals of their participation and practices. For students, this negotiation and self-reflection largely takes place during reading. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructors working with social annotation tools like Lacuna are presented with the opportunity to incorporate students’ interests and struggles with texts into teaching, which can include the potentially discomfiting need to cede to the students some measure of control. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our case study has surfaced themes of authority, agency, and new forms of relationships in courses where technology makes student activity visible to instructors. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the current study focused on classroom dynamics, a vital question that needs further consideration is the specific way in which student learning is influenced by the pedagogical moves that Lacuna enables. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using annotations as evidence of critical reading and dialogic practices is an opportunity that is relatively unique to digital learning environments which capture traces of student activity. These data provide critical insights into student thinking, both on an individual and collective level, and can be used as a type of formative assessment for tracking learning over time (Thille et al. 2014). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erna Yackel and Paul Cobb (1996, 473) nicely summarize the perspective of many: “The development of intellectual and social autonomy is a major goal in the current educational reform movement, more generally, and in the reform movement in mathematics education, in particular. In this regard, the reform is in agreement with Piaget that the main purpose of education is autonomy.” (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 3.1 provides a sampling of opposite positions. The left side shows the terms adopted by reform-minded educators, and the right side displays the terms they use to label the alternatives. We assume that the preference for greater choice reflects a desire for students to develop agency. Choice is what creates the possibility of agency, and therefore many educational researchers prefer high-choice environments for learning. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible consequence of a museum experience is that it makes the content of the exhibits “sticky.” The museum experience might create a small interest that helps future related information stick to that interest. (p. 78)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out with a choice-based assessment, the visitors could receive a URL to play a game that has a lot of computer characters talking simultaneously, much like a party. At a select time, one of the characters among all the other voices could say a sentence that included the words “cosmic rays.” Would the brains of the people who had gone to the exhibit “choose” to hear the sentence more than people who had not gone to the exhibit? (The analog is when people somehow hear their name at a party, even though all the other words in the crowd were just an unattended sound track until their name was spoken.) If people did hear the character say “cosmic rays,” would they then choose to engage this character in the game? (p. 79)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 Standards for Twenty-First-Century Learning Choices (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In education, the decision about what to assess is largely driven by content standards. Standards create the possibility of accountability. The standards adopted by an educational system influence the textbooks written for that system, the daily instruction, and the assessments. Because of their importance, standards are often developed by high-powered committees. This can involve a good deal of negotiation about what is valuable for an educated citizen. A concern with many standards is that negotiations yield laundry lists. An analogy comes from college English departments (and others, of course). All faculty members believe that their particular area of expertise should be considered mandatory for the students, whether or not it fits with everything else being offered. This produces something that is less coherent than one might want. It leads to the risk of a mile-wide, inchdeep curriculum. Designers of assessments have to chase standards, coherent or not. If standards do not have a set of overarching principles, the designers of assessments also do not have a set of principles for translating the standards into assessments. This can lead to unhappy results. (p. 81)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach is to develop a model of what it means to be an educated person. Rather than a laundry list of competencies, the target of instruction and assessment would be more holistic. There is a common joke about developmental psychology textbooks: each chapter decomposes an aspect of child development to the point where there are no actual children in the textbook. It is an analog of the blind people each feeling a different part of an elephant and never being able to grasp the whole of the beast. A frame for standards could present a holistic model that helps keep in mind the recipients of education when designing for the many discrete competencies. (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giyoo Hatano and Kayoko Inagaki (1986) distinguished two types of expertise that are relevant to choice-based assessments: routine expertise and adaptive expertise. For recurrent situations of low variability, people can develop routine expertise: a set of rapid, consistent, and error-free routines. (p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dependence of these experts on routines led Hatano and his colleagues to propose adaptive expertise, which differs from the routine expertise of the abacus masters. Adaptive expertise is more appropriate for situations of high variability. Rather than replicating efficient routines, adaptive experts vary their behaviors and understanding in response to a changing environment. Hatano and Inagaki enumerated some of the characteristics of adaptive expertise that differentiate it from routine expertise: the ability to verbalize the principles underlying one’s skills; the ability to judge conventional and unconventional versions of skills as appropriate; and the ability to modify or invent skills according to local constraints. Others have added to this list (e.g., deliberate practice, Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer 1993; prospective adaptation, Martin and Schwartz 2009). (p. 85)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, Bransford, and Sears (2005) built on Hatano’s work to create the simple learning framework in figure 7.2. (p. 85)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horizontal dimension emphasizes efficiency at specific tasks. Efficiency is especially important for recurrent situations, where it is better to rapidly and accurately remember as well as apply a solution, instead of figuring it out over and over again. The trajectory along this dimension leads to routine expertise, which comprises a set of efficient skills and retrieval patterns that are high on accuracy and speed with low variability in execution. (p. 86)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vertical dimension in figure 7.2 stresses innovation experiences that involve handling novelty and variation. If students will have to adapt to a changing future, then they will need experiences that prepare them to invent new ways of understanding and doing things. Training the mastery of a given skill will not be sufficient. People need to be prepared to adapt—that is, learn something new. (p. 87)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposal embodied in figure 7.2 is that simply having students engage in innovative experiences is not sufficient to put them on a trajectory to adaptive expertise. Innovation without a strong body of understanding and efficient skills leads to inappropriate invention. (p. 87)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimal adaptability corridor (OAC) illustrates the goal of integrating experiences that support both efficiency and innovation. Many discussions in education pit these against each other—for example, discovery learning versus training (Tobias and Duffy 2009). This is a mistake, because there are different processes associated with efficiency and innovation, and therefore they do not displace one another. People need a balance of both. (p. 87)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;daptive expertise seems highly relevant to recent discussions about the skills and competencies needed for the twenty-first century. Proposals range from increased creativity to improved social skills as well as many others. The catalyst for generating lists of twenty-first-century skills comes from a realization that times have changed and will continue to do so. The lists are responsive to a vision of a future filled with rapid changes in work, communication, global interdependence, technology, and ideally learning. In this future, individuals’ abilities to adapt to changes along with their abilities to innovate those rapid changes will largely be a function of their abilities to make effective learning choices. (p. 91)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists of twenty-first-century skills often focus on innovation (the vertical dimension from figure 7.2), which has been lacking in many standards. These skills have not been well operationalized into assessments, however, in part because of the hegemony of knowledge-based assessments. Choice-based assessments suit the gist of twenty-first-century skills because they embody an inherently dynamic perspective that matches the realization that people will need to continue to learn and adapt. (p. 91)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of twenty-first-century skills and competencies needs to be actionable if it is meant to do more than sort students (p. 91)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, there are confusions about which of the competencies can be taught. For example, many people propose that creativity is an innate personality trait rather than a learnable skill (e.g., Barron and Harrington 1981; Gough 1979). This is the wrong way to think about these competencies. The question instead is whether people choose to engage in them. In his review of creativity, Robert Sternberg (2006, 97) states, “Creativity is in large part a decision that anyone can make but that few people actually do make because they find the costs to be too high.” From this perspective, people can learn to make the choice to be creative, assuming there are environments that support this choice. (p. 92)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nobel physicist Leon Lederman (with Teresi 1993) provides a useful analogy for understanding the challenge of finding invisible constructs—in his case for subnuclear particles. He describes aliens (the Twilo) who come to earth and happen on a soccer match. They cannot see the colors black and white, which means they cannot see the soccer ball. They can see the players running, the goalie falling to the ground, and the crowd cheering. Their task is to figure out what organizes all these behaviors—that is, they need to infer the existence of a ball. It takes an inspired leap to posit an invisible construct. Moreover, once one posits the construct, it is necessary to decide which evidence is relevant and could confirm or falsify the existence of the construct. (p. 103)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of test makers is not that different. A person, researcher, or group of people may propose a construct such as “scientific identification.” Because it is a new idea, the purported properties of the construct are poorly understood; it is not clear who has it or how much; and the measures that would reveal its existence are also unknown. It is a hard endeavor. (p. 103)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliability is important. Through an unlucky coincidence (or maybe not a coincidence), however, the methodological demand of reliability coincides with a tendency of people to take an essentialist perspective that reifies assessments into stable traits or essences of a person—individual properties that do not change. Ray McDermott (1993) ironically describes how disability constructs “acquire” children, which in turn defines the children going forward, both inwardly and outwardly. Reified individual properties can range from disabilities to mastered knowledge to personality types to intelligence. The combination of the need for a stable assessment and the simplicity of thinking in terms of stable traits can yield useful scientific advances. (p. 106)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, the psychometrics of assessment bogs down in proof to the detriment of improvement. In an invited paper written to his peers via the Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Wainer (2010, 12–13) declared, “The psychometrics of today is both more extensive and better than we need&amp;hellip; . If we want to improve the practice of testing, there is much more bang for the buck to be had in improving tests than improving test theory.” (p. 117)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test evaluation frequently depends on inferential statistics such as t-tests and F-tests, which are designed to (dis)prove a hypothesis. The strict inferential statistics for establishing constructs, reliability, and validity can choke innovation. If we let go of inferential statistics and dreams of proof, we can embrace a new set of data-mining tools for handling behavioral data. These tools are exploratory and meant to aid human induction rather than (dis)prove hypotheses. They detect patterns within large data sets, and then it is up to subsequent research to determine if these patterns are valid and reliable. Choice-based assessments are prime candidates for data mining, because they collect large amounts of data by recording each click a student makes while learning. (p. 117)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data mining provides a new set of tools for handling complex behaviors. Portions of the psychometric community have embraced the challenge of handling rich data. Witness the enthusiastic preface to Automated Scoring of Complex Tasks in Computer-Based Testing (Williamson, Mislevy, and Bejar 2006, 2): (p. 118)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technological advances of the past decade are a catalyst for change in educational measurement. They allow increased flexibility, complexity, interactivity and realism of computer-administered assessment tasks, including multimedia components. Coupled with capabilities for internet delivery and its implications for large-scale on-demand administration, the potential wealth of data that can be tracked and recorded from such administrations appears capable of revolutionizing assessment. Such a revolution relies, in part, on the promise of a standardized automated analytical approach to measuring previously elusive constructs and complex problem-solving behavior. Of course, this promise depends on the ability of the measurement profession to address new challenges in the practice of educational measurement posed by such an approach to assessment. (p. 119)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students’ choices of whether and how to use the resources along with their accuracy on embedded questions are fed into machine-learning algorithms to produce student problem-solving models. Student performances can be characterized in terms of strategies such as guessing (quick, incorrect results with little resource use), perseverating (combing through resources without achieving correct results), plodding (the inefficient use of resources leading to correct results), and expert performance (using only the most useful resources to achieve correct results). The IMMEX Project provides a strong illustration of how it is possible to capture and catalog learning choices in an open environment. (p. 121)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to identify informative patterns of choice will depend on advancements in data mining, which are proliferating quickly. One new technique (Li and Biswas 2002) looks for hidden Markov models (HMM; Rabiner 1989). Automated HMM analysis finds recurrent patterns of choices. (p. 121)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decide what to do once an assessment has detected that a student is making poor choices. How do we help students make correct choices and then see if they learn from that instruction? Deciding the best actions we can take to help students learn to make good choices is beyond the purview of this book, but if we want an assessment to yield actionable information, then the assessment should help students, educators, parents, or even a well-programmed computer consider candidate actions. Moreover, assessments that drive instructional actions (p. 126)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an assessment helps improve learning, then we know the assessment is measuring something useful and in a useful way. (p. 144)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an assessment supplies feedback that a student is making poor choices, and it also includes successful provisions for improving those choices, then it gains a tremendous amount of credibility. (p. 144)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a computer learning environment, an ideal choice-based assessment would adapt to the choices the students make, so it would support their abilities to make better choices. We will call this a choice-adaptive learning environment. The term adaptive, as used here, does not refer to current versions of computer-adaptive testing. In computer-adaptive testing, the term adaptive indicates the ability of the computer to efficiently hone in on a student’s level of knowledge by constantly recalibrating question difficulty based on the student’s performance so far. Computer-adaptive testing is about shortening overall test-taking time. A choice-adaptive environment instead adapts to students’ choices to help guide them to better ones. Instruction and assessment would be seamlessly coupled, providing important guidance to learners, educators, and policymakers. (p. 144)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment is inextricably linked to questions of fairness. Three outstanding issues are the content of the assessment, the use of the results, and respect for the persons being assessed. Regarding the content of an assessment, educational assessment entails a commitment to elevating some aspects of experience and individuals over others. This in turn raises questions of what measures are fair to include or exclude. As a concrete example, one of us (Schwartz) taught in a remote little Alaskan village for many years (remote, that is, from the vantage point of city dwellers). The village did not have radio or television; it was also five hundred air miles from the nearest road. One year, the students received a reading test that used the word curb. The village had no curbs, and most of the students had never seen one. On that item, they surely did poorly compared to city dwellers. This example fits into a larger discussion about whether assessments should take into account students’ opportunity to learn (Moss et al. 2008) or should be treated more like driving tests, where the public only cares whether a person is competent to a standard. (p. 149)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is an engine of human performance, but it is still up to the driver to choose where to steer the car. With choices, we are telling people where they should steer their cars. Choice-based assessments go beyond measuring enablement to measuring action itself. This potentially intrudes on personal freedom, because people should be allowed to steer their own car. Of course, knowledge-based assessments also steer the car (as we will discuss below). But choice makes the intrusion more salient. This elevation of ethical concern is notable, since it shows that choices are closer to what people care about and therefore what we should be assessing. (p. 151)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should a treatment of the United States, say, include the Anglo-Saxon version of America, the Native American version, the African-American version, or perhaps the Soviet one? Notably, these types of issues do not show up much in science or mathematics curricula (e.g., Should we teach intelligent design?). With the introduction of choice as an outcome, educators in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines would no longer be falsely protected from these normative questions by believing that whatever they teach is safely objective. If they were teaching choices, then they could not ignore the socially constructed reality of educational outcomes. They would have to consider whether asking students to develop interest and persistence has equal standing to learning the objectively known quadratic equation. (p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might we decide what choices to emphasize while minimizing the potential for unfairness? It is important to remember that the choices we care about are learning-relevant ones; not all choices are diagnostic from the perspective of learning. A useful first step is to take an empirical approach. Here, the goal would be to determine which choices have the largest influence on learning. (p. 153)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing students with the belief they are making a choice does not skirt the paradox because the outcomes of those choices and how those outcomes shape future choices are still enforced by authority. In educational settings, the consequences of making a given choice are largely orchestrated by that setting. This is how educational settings can create a protected learning environment: by controlling the consequences attached to different choices. This orchestration also makes it so that some choices are better than others. (p. 155)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. F. Skinner (1986), a US behaviorist, famously proposed that education should unambiguously shape student behavior by establishing clear reinforcement contingencies for those things that need to be taught. School is not life, he contended. After school, students can choose—or more properly, believe they choose—whatever actions they would like. Skinner’s arguments are compelling, although the science behind them has been superseded by new findings and theories. But at a higher level, Skinner missed something fundamental. The narrative of choice and agency is basic to contemporary discourse and people’s selfconception (Bandura 1989). Whether or not the narrative is correct, agency is a socially constructed reality, and our civil society depends on it. Students need to experience and reflect on the agency of choice, even if they are guided toward some choices over others. So whether or not one likes the idea of providing “faux” choices for students, it is important for them to experience choice making. In Callan’s paradox, we would be satisfied if children had a chance to entertain the possibility of not being Catholic, even if that was not really an option until they were older. If the goal is to prepare people to choose, then the existence of choices needs to suffuse learning. (p. 156)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have a natural tendency toward wishful thinking. Wishful thinking about assessments—that they are impartial measures, much like a yardstick is an impartial measure of height—lets people avoid the clutter of ethical questions and treat assessments as objective measures. But the truth is that an educational assessment is not a yardstick. It does not simply measure a learning outcome. Assessment elevates some aspects of experience over others, and it actively shapes what people consider important. Assessments do not merely test reality; they also create it. (p. 160)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, assessments are a lighthouse in the fog of education—a clear guide by which to make safe decisions. But in reality, assessments create the fog. Current assessments perpetuate beliefs that the proper outcomes of learning are static facts and routine skills—stuff that is easy to score as right or wrong. Interest, curiosity, identification, self-efficacy, belonging, and all the other goals of informal learning cannot even sit at the assessment table, because these outcomes are too far removed from current beliefs about what is really important. Assessments seem to be built on the presupposition that people will never need to learn anything new after the test, because current assessments miss so many aspects of what it means to be prepared for future learning. These frozen-moment assessments have influenced what people think counts as useful learning, which then shows up in curricula, standards, instructional technologies, and people’s pursuits. If the fog were lifted, we would see that most of the stakeholders in education care first and foremost about people’s abilities to make good choices. Making good choices depends on what people know, but it also depends on much more, including interest, persistence, and a host of twenty-first-century soft skills that are critical to learning. Where we can anticipate a stable future—decoding letters into words is likely to be a stable demand for the next fifty years—then knowledgeand skillbased assessments make sense. In relation to those aspects of the future that are less stable, though, people will need to choose whether, what, when, and how to learn. Hence, it is important (p. 164)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to focus on choices that influence learning, and assessments should measure those choices. Choice is the critical outcome of learning, not knowledge. Knowledge is an enabler; choice is the outcome. (p. 165)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing choices during learning has a number of attractive properties. Foremost, choice-based assessments are process oriented. They examine learning choices in action rather than only the end products. This process focus makes it possible to connect the learning behaviors during the assessment to processes that occur in a learning environment. Second, the assessments reveal what students are prepared to learn, so they are prospective as opposed to retrospective. Third, choice resonates with the rest of the social sciences that examine the movements of people, money, and ideas. Fourth, choices do not lend themselves to simplistic reifications whereby things like people’s knowledge or personality traits are misinterpreted as independent of context and immune to change. Fifth, choices can measure a much greater range of learning outcomes than fact retrieval and procedural application. We have demonstrated several, including persistence after failure, critical thinking, attending to some ideas over others, creating a general solution, creative design, reading to learn, use of help, inductive strategies, and the uptake of feedback. There are many more to be had. Sixth, learning choices are a good candidate for inclusion in standards, which currently define what knowledge students should have but stay strangely silent about the processes of learning themselves. (p. 165)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice work! So this work follows this &amp;lsquo;logic&amp;rsquo;: SRL is important and we have good theoretical models based on decades of research. We have Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain as an &amp;lsquo;open-ended learning environment&amp;rsquo; (note that&amp;rsquo;s different from open learning environments), where SRL is key for learner success. Coherence Analysis now kicks in as a novel approach to assessing SRL, based in a SRL model and situated in Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain; CA derives a bunch of indices that are predictive of learning performance measured by knowledge tests in this study. These indices are then used to cluster students. Sequence mining is then applied to further interpret different clusters (incorporating temporal information extracted from log analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is rare to have a strong theoretically-driven approach + clear articulation of assumptions + clear operationalization of metrics in learning analytics research. This paper is one of these exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, wondering how easy it would be for researchers to apply the CA indices in a different context. Also more generally wondering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when would LA research escape using knowledge tests as the benchmarks of learning, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;furthermore, are there other ways to investigate in this context, instead of following the &amp;ldquo;indices-extraction&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;clustering&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;contrasting-clusters&amp;rdquo; approach? (I&amp;rsquo;m in lack of good terms to describe this approach.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we present our work in developing and evaluating coherence analysis (CA), a novel approach to interpreting students’ learning behaviours in OELEs. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SRL is an active theory of learning that describes how learners are able to set goals, create plans for achieving those goals, continually monitor their progress, and revise their plans when necessary. SRL is a multi‐faceted construct: it involves emotional and behavioural control, management of one’s learning environment and cognitive resources, perseverance in the face of difficulties, and social interactions to promote effective learning (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Schunk, 2011). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;open‐ended computer‐based learning environments (OELEs; Clarebout &amp;amp; Elen, 2008; Land, Hannafin, &amp;amp; Oliver, 2012), which provide a learning context and a set of tools for exploring, hypothesizing, and building solutions to authentic and complex problems. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To validate our approach, we applied CA to data from a recent classroom study with the Betty’s Brain OELE (Kinnebrew, Segedy, &amp;amp; Biswas, 2014; Leelawong &amp;amp; Biswas, 2008). Results demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in 1) predicting students’ task performance and learning gains and 2) identifying common problem‐solving approaches among the students in the study. Further, the results demonstrate relationships between CA‐derived metrics and students’ prior skill levels, offering a potential explanation for students’ problem‐solving behaviours. Taken together, these results provide insight into students’ SRL processes and suggest targets for adaptive scaffolds to support students’ development of open‐ended problem‐solving skills. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OELEs may vary in the particular sets of tools they provide, they often include tools for 1) seeking and acquiring information, 2) applying that information to a problem‐solving task, and 3) assessing the quality of the constructed solution. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roscoe, Segedy, Sulcer, Jeong, &amp;amp; Biswas describe SRL as containing “multiple and recursive stages incorporating cognitive and metacognitive strategies” (2013, p. 286). Their description of SRL is summarized in Figure 1; it presents SRL as involving phases of orientation and planning, enactment and learning, and reflection and self‐assessment. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1. Amodel of SRL according to the descriptionin Roscoe et al. (2013) (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring students’ self‐regulation and metacognitive behaviour in real time is a difficult task; it requires developing systematic analysis techniques for detecting aspects of goal setting, planning, monitoring, and reflection in the context of the learning environment. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this complexity, researchers have developed several approaches to measuring aspects of self‐ regulation and metacognition in OELEs. For example, MetaTutor (Bouchet et al., 2013) adopts a very direct approach; it provides interface features through which students can externalize their SRL processes. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach employed in several OELEs involves developing a predictive, data‐driven model for diagnosing constructs related to SRL in real time (e.g., engagement, frustration, or confusion). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other OELEs, researchers have developed theory‐driven models of SRL and embedded those models into learning environments. For example, EcoLab (Luckin &amp;amp; du Boulay, 1999; Luckin &amp;amp; Hammerton, 2002) measures students’ metacognitive awareness of their own ability by comparing the system’s assessment of students’ ability levels with the difficulty of the activities they choose to pursue. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;coherence analysis (CA), and applied that approach to the interpretation of log data from Betty’s Brain. However, rather than focusing on a specific aspect of SRL (e.g., awareness of one’s own ability), CA focuses on students’ ability to seek for, interpret, and apply information encountered while working in the OELE. In doing so, CA models aspects of students’ problem‐solving skills and metacognitive abilities simultaneously. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 COHERENCE ANALYSIS (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop this approach, we first performed a task‐driven analysis of Betty’s Brain (similar to cognitive task analysis; Chipman, Schraagen, &amp;amp; Shalin, 2000) to derive 1) the primary tasks that students should be able to complete to succeed in an OELE, and 2) the processes students must execute to complete those tasks. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1 Cognitive and Metacognitive Problem-solving Processes in OELEs (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tasks and their more specific implementations in Betty’s Brain have been incorporated into atask model (Figure 3) that specifies the tasks important for achieving success in Betty’s Brain. The highest level of the model identifies the three broad classes of OELE tasks related to 1) information seeking and acquisition, 2) solution construction and refinement, and 3) solution assessment. Each of these task categories is further broken down into three levels that represent 1) general task descriptions common across all OELEs (according to the definition of OELE discussed above); 2) Betty’s Brain specific instantiations of these tasks; and 3) interface features in Betty’s Brain through which students can accomplish their tasks. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directed links in the task model represent dependency relations. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a great example of theory-driven analytics. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying and evaluating the relevance of information describes the processes students employ as they observe, operate on, and make sense of the information presented in an OELE’s information acquisition tools (Land, 2000; Quintana et al., 2004). Productively employing these processes requires an understanding of how to identify critical information and interpret it correctly. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task model, along with the model of SRL presented in Figure 1, identifies and draws connections among the cognitive and metacognitive processes critical for learning in OELEs. Students need to leverage their metacognitive knowledge and task understanding in order to select intermediate goals for completing their tasks and then create plans for coordinating their use of skills and strategies in service of achieving those goals. Creating these plans requires understanding the purposes of, and relationships among, the tasks identified in the task model. Effective plans will utilize information gained from both information acquisition and solution assessment activities in order to build and refine a causal map that more closely approximates the expected solution. Because students are likely to make mistakes in constructing their solutions, they need to understand how to utilize the results of solution assessments to direct their thinking as they reflect on the sources of their errors. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2 Modelling Learner Behaviours with Coherence Analysis (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coherence Analysis (CA) approach analyzes learners’ behaviours by combining information from sequences of student actions to produce measures of action coherence. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When students take actions that put them into contact with information that can help them improve their current solution, they have generated potential that should motivate future actions. The assumption is that if students can recognize relevant information in the resources and quiz results, then they should act on that information. If they do not act on information that they encountered previously, CA assumes that they did not recognize or understand the relevance of that information. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two notions come together in the definition of action coherence: Two ordered actions (ݕ→ݔ ) taken by a student in an OELE are action coherent if the second action, ݕ , is based on information generated by the first action, ݔ . In this case, ݔ provides support for ݕ , and ݕ is supported by ݔ . Should a learner execute ݔ without subsequently executing ݕ , the learner has created unused potential in relation to ݕ . Note that actions ݔ and ݕ need not be consecutive. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task model (Figure 3) implies two critical coherence relations: 1) applying information acquired from the hypertext resources to editing the map; and 2) applying inferred link correctness information (as obtained via quizzes) to editing the map. More specifically, an information seeking action (e.g., reading about a causal relationship) may generate support for a future solution construction action (e.g., adding that causal relationship to the map). Similarly, a solution construction action can be supported by a solution assessment action. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CA assumes that learners with higher levels of action coherence possess stronger metacognitive knowledge and task understanding. Thus, these learners will perform a larger proportion of supported actions and take advantage of a larger proportion of the potential that their actions generate. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action coherence metrics measure whether or not learners’ actions take advantage of previously encountered information. To measure whether or not a learner’s actions contradict the information generated during previous activities, CA also incorporates measures of action incoherence: Two ordered actions (ݕ→ݔ ) taken by a student in an OELE are action incoherent if the second action, ݕ , is action coherent with the negation of information generated by the first action, ݔ . In this case, ݔ provides negative support for ݕ , and ݕ is contradicted by ݔ . (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CA assumes that learners with higher levels of incoherence among their actions possess a weaker understanding of the science domain and the relations between different concepts in the domain. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hypotheses in developing CA were as follows: 1. Students’ CA‐derived metrics would predict their learning and success in teaching Betty; 2. Students’ prior levels of task understanding would predict their CA‐derived metrics while using Betty’s Brain. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH BETTY’S BRAIN (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety‐nine 6th grade students from four mid‐Tennessee science classrooms participated in the study. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students used Betty’s Brain to learn about human thermoregulation when exposed to cold temperatures. The expert map, shown in Figure 4, contained 13 concepts and 15 links representing cold detection (cold temperatures, heat loss, body temperature, cold detection, hypothalamus response) and three bodily responses to cold: goose bumps (skin contraction, raised skin hairs, warm air near skin, heat loss), vasoconstriction (blood vessel constriction, blood flow to the skin, heat loss), and shivering (skeletal muscle contractions, friction in the body, heat in the body). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.4 Learning Assessments Learning was assessed using a pre‐test–post‐test design with two parts: a set of computer‐based exercises and a set of paper‐and‐pencil questions. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.5 Log File Analysis (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The log files provided the information required to calculate a measure of task performance for each student. By tracking the evolution of a student’s causal map, we could compute how the student’s causal map score changed over time. The map score at any point in time is calculated as the number of correct links (i.e., links that appear in the expert map) minus the number of incorrect links in the student’s map. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The log files also served as input to CA, which automatically calculated the following metrics for each student: 1. Edit Frequency: the number of causal link edits and annotations made by the student divided by number of minutes that the student was logged onto the system. 2. Unsupported edit percentage: the percentage of causal link edits and annotations not supported by any of the previous views that occurred within afive‐minute window of the edit. 3. Information viewing time: the amount of time spent viewing either the science resource pages or Betty’s graded answers. Information viewing percentage is the percentage of the student’s time on the system classified as information viewing time. 4. Potential generation time: the amount of information viewing time spent viewing information that could support causal map edits that would improve the map score. To calculate this, we annotated each hypertext resource page with information about the concepts and links discussed on that page. Potential generation percentage is the percentage of information viewing time classified as potential generation time. 5. Used potential time: the amount of potential generation time associated with views that both occur within a prior five‐minute window and also support an ensuing causal map edit. Used potential percentage is the percentage of potential generation time classified as used potential time. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metrics one and two capture the quantity and quality of a student’s causal link edits and annotations, where supported edits and annotations are considered to be of higher quality. Metrics three, four, and five capture the quantity and quality of the student’s time viewing either the resources or Betty’s graded answers. These metrics speak to the student’s ability to seek and identify information that may help her build or refine her map (potential generation percentage) and then utilize information from those pages in future map‐editing activities (used potential percentage). (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a complement to the CA‐derived metrics, we employed an information‐theoretic differential sequence mining approach (Kinnebrew, Mack, Biswas, &amp;amp; Chang, 2014) to analyze students’ action sequences further. This allowed us to identify sequential action patterns that best differentiated groups of students defined by the CA‐derived metrics. The analysis considered the following student actions: 1) reading resource pages; 2) adding, removing, or editing causal links in the map (further distinguished by whether or not the edit improved the map score); 3) asking Betty to answer causal questions; 4) having Betty take quizzes; 5) asking Betty to explain her answer to a question; 6) creating, editing, and viewing notes; and 7) annotating links to keep track of their correctness. The derivation of action definitions from raw activity logs is discussed further in (Kinnebrew et al., 2013). (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting. wondering how this &amp;lsquo;information-theoretic differential sequence mining&amp;rsquo; works. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 RESULTS (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.2 Relationships between CA-Derived Metrics, Learning, and Performance (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students edited their maps fairly often (0.60 times per minute), and on average, 55.7% of these edits were supported. Students spent roughly one‐third of their total time viewing information, but only 65.3% of this viewing time was spent on information that could support causal map edits. Students used, on average, a majority of the potential that they generated (62.3%), and they were mostly engaged in their learning (88.8%). (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results show that several of the CA metrics were significantly and moderately‐to‐strongly correlated with students’ best map scores. Best map scores were positively correlated with edit frequency (r = 0.56), potential generation percentage (r =0.41), and used potential percentage (r = 0.60). Best map scores were negatively correlated with unsupported edit percentage (r = –0.49) and disengaged percentage (r = –0.46). Students’ CA metrics were also correlated with their short answer learning gains. More specifically, short answer learning gains were positively correlated with edit frequency (r = 0.40), potential generation percentage (r = 0.26), and used potential percentage (r = 0.26). (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To investigate these relationships further, we conducted multiple regression analyses to predict each of the learning gain measures and the best map score with the six CA metrics. The CA metrics predicted best map scores (F=22.87, p &amp;lt;0.001, R2 = 0.601) and gains on short answer items (F=4.544, p &amp;lt;0.001, R2 = 0.231) with statistical significance. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these analyses provide potential insight into why particular students experienced more or less success. Negative correlations between unsupported edit percentage and information viewing percentage, potential generation percentage, and used potential percentage along with the positive correlation between unsupported edit percentage and disengaged percentage may suggest abehaviour profile characterized by disengagement, effort avoidance, and/or a difficulty in identifying causal links in the resources. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, these results provide support for our first hypothesis. Students’ CA‐derived metrics were collectively predictive of their short answer learning gains (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test our second hypothesis — that students’ prior levels of task understanding would predict their CA‐derived metrics while using Betty’s Brain — we calculated correlations between CA metrics and students’ pre‐test skill levels (6). Most correlations are weak. However, some specific pre‐test skill levels were weakly and significantly correlated with the CA metrics. Students with higher causal reasoning scores edited their maps more often (r = 0.23) and used proportionally more of the potential they generated (r = 0.27). (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, we found only limited support for our second hypothesis. Students who were better at interpreting causal relations in text passages during the pre‐test edited their maps somewhat more frequently and exhibited slightly higher levels of coherence (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.3 Exploratory Clustering Analysis (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 8 illustrates the resulting dendrogram. The analysis revealed five relatively distinct clusters containing 24, 39, 5, 6, and 24 students. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cluster 1 students (n=24) may be characterized as frequent researchers and careful editors; these students spent large proportions of their time (42.4%) viewing sources of information and did not edit their maps very often. When they did edit their maps, the edit was usually supported by recent activities ( (unsupported edit percentage = 29.4%). Most of the information they viewed was useful for improving their causal maps (potential generation percentage = 71.4%), but they often did not take advantage of this information (used potential percentage = 58.9%). (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cluster 2 students (n=39) may be characterized as strategic experimenters. These students spent a fair proportion of their time (33.5%) viewing sources of information, and, like Cluster 1 students, often did not take advantage of this information (used potential percentage = 62.6%). Unlike Cluster 1 students, they performed more map edits, a higher proportion of which were unsupported, as they tried to construct the correct causal model. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cluster 3 students (n=5) may be characterized as confused guessers. These students edited their maps fairly infrequently and usually without support. They spent an average of 58.9% of their time viewing sources of information, but most of their time viewing information did not generate potential (potential generation percentage = 45.8%). (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cluster 4 (n=6) may be characterized as disengaged from the task. On average, these students spent more than 30% of their time on the system (more than 45 minutes of class time) in a state of disengagement. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cluster 5 students (n=24) are characterized by a high edit frequency (just over 1 edit per minute), and most of these students’ edits (70.9%) were supported. Additionally, they spent just over one‐third of their time viewing information, and over three‐fourths of this time viewing information that generated potential. These students are distinct from students in the other four clusters in that they used a large majority of the potential they generated (82.0%) and were rarely in a state of disengagement (3.1%). In other words, these students appeared to be engaged and efficient. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore more detailed behaviour differences between the identified clusters, we employed the information‐theoretic differential sequence mining approach described in Kinnebrew, Mack, Biswas, &amp;amp; Chang (2104) and the Log File Analysis section above. This approach identified the action patterns that best differentiate the five clusters, the top seven of which are presented in Table 106 . (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 10. Means (and standard deviations) of activity pattern frequency by cluster (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the other top differential activity patterns described in Table 10 involve a combination of map editing (specifically with respect to incorrect links) and quizzing, patterns that have been associated with successful performance in Betty’s Brain (Kinnebrew et al., 2013). For example, patterns 2 and 6 are characteristic of supported map edits based on quiz results. In particular, pattern 6 is characteristic of exploring the quiz results more deeply by viewing Betty’s answer explanation. Patterns 3, 5, and 7 are characteristic of using quizzes to monitor progress. After the student edits the map, they have Betty take a quiz in order to evaluate the effect of that edit on her quiz performance. Pattern 4 combines these two pattern types into a pattern characteristic of an edit‐and‐check strategy, in which students add a link to their map, use a quiz to monitor the effect of that link on Betty’s performance, and then, upon discovering the link is incorrect, remove it from their maps. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All six of these activity patterns display similar relative use across the clusters, having the highest average frequency in engaged and efficient students, moderate frequencies in researchers/careful editors and strategic experimenters, and low frequencies in confused guessers and disengaged students. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these results indicate that students in more successful clusters were more likely to employ behaviours illustrating productive uses of the quiz for solution assessment. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so this work follows this &amp;lsquo;logic&amp;rsquo;: SRL is important and we have good theoretical models based on decades of research. We have Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain as an &amp;lsquo;open-ended learning environment&amp;rsquo; (note that&amp;rsquo;s different from open learning environments), where SRL is key for learner success. Coherence Analysis now kicks in as a novel approach to assessing SRL, based in a SRL model and situated in Betty&amp;rsquo;s Brain; CA derives a bunch of indices that are predictive of learning performance measured by knowledge tests in this study. These indices are then used to cluster students. Sequence mining is then applied to further interpret different clusters (incorporating temporal information extracted from log analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current study presents a &lt;strong&gt;microgenetic analysis&lt;/strong&gt; and case study of one student’s processes of knowledge construction as he played a conceptually integrated digital game (SURGE Next) designed to support learning about Newtonian mechanics. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCEPTUALLY INTEGRATED GAMES (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a conceptually integrated game, domain-specific learning goals are integrated with the mechanics and narrative of a game. Games designed in this way can allow students to build on intuitive understandings of complex physical phenomena (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each game level (i.e., mission in the game) involves specific challenges that are designed to engage learners in reasoning about key concepts in Newtonian mechanics. Players navigate through the game by placing impulses on Surge’s ship so that it reaches the desired target, often avoiding obstacles on its way. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptual integration in SURGE Next can be understood more concretely in light of two key characteristics in the design of the game levels: (a) the representational format of dot traces in each level and (b) the sequencing of levels. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, an increase in Surge’s speed results in a greater gap between successive dots, whereas a decrease in speed results in dots placed closer to one another. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the second dimension, it is noteworthy that our pedagogical approach bears deep similarities with, and builds on, previous research about learning Newtonian mechanics using microworlds, in particular, the ThinkerTools microworlds-based learning environment (White, 1984, 1993). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, when interacting with microworlds, learners themselves are acting simultaneously as users and designers (Edwards, 1995; Hoyles et al., 2002). In ThinkerTools, the objective is for students to construct a series of increasingly sophisticated causal models for reasoning about how forces affect the motion of objects, in a sequence of progressively more complex microworlds. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRAMEWORK FOR CONCEPTUAL CHANGE (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two prominent theoretical approaches have tried to account for mechanisms of conceptual change in humans—theory change (also known as the coherence view) and KiP (also known as the fragmentation view). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;concepts are embedded in theories (i.e., cognitive structures that represent a range of phenomena and the causal principles that explain them; e.g., Carey, 1985, 1999; Carey &amp;amp; Spelke, 1994; C. Smith, Maclin, Grosslight, &amp;amp; Davis, 1997; Wiser, 1995). Whereas theory change can sometimes involve the gradual change in beliefs formulated in terms of the same concepts—Carey (1988) termed this kind of change weak restructuring—in other cases, concepts in successive theories may themselves differ, and this type of change is known as strong restructuring (Carey, 1988, 1992, 1999; Carey &amp;amp; Spelke, 1994). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complementary perspective, the KiP perspective, frames conceptual change as a gradual and continuous process that relies on bootstrapping as opposed to discarding ideas that students bring in with them to the instructional setting (Clark, 2006; diSessa, 1988, 1993; diSessa &amp;amp; Sherin, 1998; Gupta, Elby, &amp;amp; Conlin, 2014; Gupta, Hammer, &amp;amp; Redish, 2010; Hammer, 1996; Jeppsson, Haglund, Amin, &amp;amp; Strömdahl, 2013; Sengupta &amp;amp; Wilensky, 2009, 2011; J. Smith et al., 1993). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;diSessa (1993) postulated that the building blocks of sense of mechanism are phenomenological primitives (p-prims). P-prims are small knowledge elements developed from repeated abstractions of familiar events. Cued on recognition of contextual cues, p-prims are used to construct intuitive understandings of the physical world. diSessa (1993) argued that conceptual change occurs through a gradual development of coherence through the alteration of structured priorities (diSessa, 1993) in relation to relevant p-prims and other knowledge elements. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the analysis of learning, the coherence and fragmentation views of conceptual change thus entail starkly different bootstrapping accounts (Amin, 2009). Although both acknowledge that the process of conceptual change takes time, the coherence view treats conceptual change as a gestalt shift with a great deal of consistency attributed to both the naïve and expert knowledge structures. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation views argue instead that naïve understanding is highly sensitive to context and that predictions and explanations depend in subtle ways on which particular knowledge elements happen to be triggered in particular situations. diSessa (1993) argued that according to the KiP perspective, conceptual change involves a gradual increase in coherence of understanding, and also suggested a cognitive mechanism through which coherence can emerge. Recent work by Chi, Roscoe, Slotta, Roy, and Chase (2012) has also shifted away from an incompatibility stance to a more continuous one, similar to diSessa (1993), especially in the domain of mechanics. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chi and colleagues (2012) defined direct schemas as intuitive explanations that involve direct causation by an agent (typically in the form of local intentional interactions of the agent with one or a few other agents or entities) and argued that sequential processes can be explained by additively “summing” or “chaining” these local events (pp. 9–11). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vosniadou’s (2013) perspectives are also evolving in a manner that can be interpreted as shifting away from an incompatibility stance toward a finer grained and organic elemental account of conceptual change (Clark &amp;amp; Linn, 2013). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, coherence perspectives would provide rather low-resolution accounts— replacement of incorrect ideas with correct ones. The KiP perspective provides a comparatively more mechanistic and fine-grained account (diSessa, 1993; Hammer, 1996; J. Smith et al., 1993) that aligns with the evolving trends toward fine-grained and organic elemental accounts on conceptual change across research perspectives. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANALYTICAL APPROACH (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students often posit that forces cause motion in the direction of the force independent of prior velocity (diSessa, 1988, 1993; Halloun &amp;amp; Hestenes, 1985; White, 1984). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;diSessa (1988, 1993) has shown that this form of incorrect explanation is a result of the Force as Mover p-prim being cued in the learner’s mind. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the application of this p-prim illustrates, the abstracted features in this case are object, push, and result. The feature that does not get abstracted from these situations is the previous velocity of the object in motion (diSessa, 1993). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;diSessa (1988) argued that the development of a more expert understanding raises the priority of the competing Force as Deflector p-prim. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of canonical physics, whereas Force as Mover neglects the role of the momentum of an object, Force as Deflector takes momentum into consideration. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is challenging for researchers to identify p-prims based on verbal explanations (diSessa, 1993, 2007). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, although our primary method of data collection focused on semistructured clinical interviews conducted at the end of each game level, we also triangulated and corroborated our analysis of students’ verbal explanations during the interviews with screen-captured videos of the students’ actual game play during the level, changes in the students’ written explanations in preand posttests, and researcher field notes. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH QUESTIONS (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;● What conceptual resources does Jamal use as he plays a digital game in the domain of physics, and how do these resources manifest in the game play? (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;● How does Jamal’s use of these resources evolve as he progresses through (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METHODS (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because SURGE Next is a conceptually integrated game, learners’ game play is deeply tied to the underlying concepts in physics. This means that the canonical concepts of force, speed, acceleration, and momentum are leveraged in an intuitive and qualitative manner during students’ game play, in the form of both representational elements such as dot traces as well as conceptually salient actions such as placement of impulses. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Context and Case Study Approach The setting for this study was a 100% African American high-poverty public charter school located in a metropolitan school district in the southeastern United States. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the students were Title I students (i.e., they had been identified by the state educational body as failing, or being most at risk for failing, in science, math, and reading). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Taber’s criteria of typicality and representativeness for case selection, we present the case of a single student named Jamal (a pseudonym). Jamal’s case was selected after we analyzed, coded, and compared data for all of the students. Representativeness implies that the selected cases should aptly represent key aspects of the instructional process. Jamal’s case is representative because Jamal was present every day and interviewed frequently, so his case provides an authentic representation of all of the instructional activities. Typicality implies that Jamal’s reasoning should be similar to that of majority of the students in the classroom. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data analysis consisted of transcriptions of interviews, development of open coding schemes, application of codes to data to identify patterns, triangulation with other data sources (i.e., video, tests, and field notes), and selection of written and verbal excerpts to represent the data. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Collection (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study lasted for five consecutive days during which the students played SURGE Next for 1.5 hr per day. Data collection used the microgenetic method (Siegler &amp;amp; Crowley, 1991) to study short-term conceptual change. The microgenetic method requires a high density of regular observations that span the entire duration of the learning activities and a qualitative analysis of the change (Kuhn, 1995; Kuhn, Schauble, &amp;amp; Garcia-Mila, 1992; Siegler &amp;amp; Crowley, 1991). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our study, these regular observations took the form of semistructured clinical interviews. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each interview ranged from 1 min to approximately 10 min, and each student was interviewed several times during each class. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding for P-Prims (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified p-prims based on categorization of (a) students’ actions as recorded during videos of game play and (b) utterances during their interviews in which they explained their actions. In order to categorize their actions and utterances, we used diSessa’s schematic for identifying p-prims (diSessa, 1993, pp. 217–223). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These observations were mainly descriptive in nature and corresponded to what Miles and Huberman (1994) termed descriptive codes. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then began open coding (Strauss &amp;amp; Corbin, 1990). During this phase of analysis, we carefully rewatched the interview videos and read the transcripts multiple times with the goal of generating analytic codes that Miles and Huberman termed pattern codes. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descriptive codes in our study corresponded to discrete events that we identified in the Camtasia screen recordings and interview transcripts. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pattern code here therefore corresponds to diSessa’s schematization of Ohm’s p-prim: increased effort or intensity of impetus leads to more result. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FINDINGS (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial Misapplication of Force as Mover and First Appearance of Force as Deflector (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Level 1, Jamal began his game play using Force as Mover and completed the level without any difficulty. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Level 2, students needed to maneuver Surge in two dimensions in order to reach the target. When Jamal encountered this level, he initially cued only the Force as Mover p-prim, which had been productive in Level 1 but which is not productive in Level 2. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On noticing Surge’s deflection (or “slant”), Jamal adopted an instrumental approach to refine his strategy. That is, instead of explicitly reasoning about how deflection emerged, he decided to use the deflection to design Surge’s trajectory. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this discovery, Jamal created a new trajectory for Surge, and his actions bear evidence that he used the Force as Deflector p-prim to do so. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistent Misapplication of Force as Mover (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his successful cuing and use of the Force as Deflector p-prim in Level 2, Jamal initially unproductively cued the Force as Mover p-prim in Level 3. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of Canceling to Correct the Misapplication of Force as Mover (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his unsuccessful application of Force as Mover in Level 3, Jamal revised his attempt using a downward impulse immediately before Surge encountered the right impulse. This revised strategy led to canceling the effects of the initial up impulse, thus enabling Surge to turn right by 90 degrees when it encountered the right impulse (see Figure 7).4 (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Jamal’s choice of the magnitude of the impulse was incidental, or subconscious at best, in the sense that he did not explicitly reason about it. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent level, Level 4, Jamal encountered a similar situation that required deflecting Surge by 90 degrees. He solved this level iteratively on his third attempt. In his initial attempt, it appears that Force as Mover was still being cued with a higher cuing priority than the Force as Deflector or Canceling pprims (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamal had two 4 N impulses to move Surge to the right, however, and only one 4 N left impulse to the left. Jamal thus did not successfully cancel the rightward horizontal velocity, resulting in an unexpected diagonal deflection (see Figure 10e). (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Level 3, Jamal’s attempt here shows that (a) he had a canceling strategy in mind but (b) his strategy of using the default magnitude of the canceling impulse did not work. This in turn created a situation that necessitated explicitly taking into account Surge’s previous velocity—both its direction and its magnitude. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward this end, Jamal removed one of the 4 N right impulses, leaving a single 4 N right impulse to begin Surge’s motion (see Figure 11a) and the two impulses (4 N left and 4 N up) at the corner (Point S) as shown in Figures 11b and 11c. When the simulation was run, Surge made a 90-degree turn and successfully hit the target (see Figure 11d). (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following diSessa’s schematization (see Appendix), the situational elements salient in Jamal’s actions are the magnitude of the canceling impetus and the effect of the impetus (i.e., the horizontal speed of Surge). (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productive Stabilization of P-Prims for Interpreting Deflection (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deflection?&lt;br /&gt;
 Is it fair to say that there was still no force as deflection p-prim in Jamal’s game play?&lt;br /&gt;
 Wondering whether the game should have been designed to have grid to scaffold students’ thinking on deflection — because it is hard to construct an accurate deflection to hit the target. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytical Summary: Distributed Encoding and the Development of an Expert-Like Conceptualization of Deflection (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 shows Jamal’s learning trajectory in a graphical form in terms of the p-prims he cued during his attempts on each level. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We posit that the development of reliability in the cuing of appropriate p-prims in these later levels can be explained in terms of what diSessa (1993) termed distributed encoding. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to diSessa, the mechanism of conceptual change involves distributed encoding, a process in which learning to “see” (i.e., interpret) a phenomenon through canonical lenses (e.g., a physical law) involves “many intuitive contributors that each play some small role in ‘knowing the law’”(diSessa, 1993, p. 115). (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jamal’s case, distributed encoding is evident in (a) Jamal’s learning to differentiate between situations involving perpendicular and diagonal deflections and (b) Jamal’s development of a progressively sophisticated sense of mechanism for dealing with perpendicular deflections. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the current study demonstrates the promise of designing conceptually integrated games around the KiP framework in terms of being able to foster, support, and investigate conceptual change in the domain of Newtonian mechanics. Specifically, this article makes two deeply intertwined contributions. The first contribution concerns the design of conceptually integrated games for learning Newtonian physics and beyond. The second contribution concerns analytical and methodological issues for investigating students’ learning as students interact with conceptually integrated games or games of other designs. (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wen, M., Yang, D., &amp;amp; Rosé, C. P. (2014). Sentiment Analysis in MOOC Discussion Forums: What does it tell us? In EDM2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Wen2014a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Notes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be a more interesting variable to correlate to than drop out rates? The link between sentiment and dropout behaviors is slippery, because we have no evidence that negative sentiments will cause dropouts. So the main logic in this paper is undermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limitation with data used in this study is also noticeable. Only having log data from one course is not most helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survival analysis at the individual level is very interesting. Although it does not confirm a general pattern across three courses, it provides an interesting way to model student participation in moocs, as well as it&amp;rsquo;s relation with other factors. Plus, it provides a kind of negative knowledge that sentiment analysis as applied in this study might not be reliable for studying moocs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the semantic analysis of topic extraction is potentially very useful for facilitating mooc forum discussion. It could lead to very interesting tool development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We observe a correlation between sentiment ratio measured based on daily forum posts and number of students who drop out each day.&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;we evaluate the impact of sentiment on attrition over time&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;a significant proportion of students remain in the course longer than that but then drop out along the way. This suggests that there are students who are struggling to stay involved. Supporting the participation of these struggling students may be the first low hanging fruit for increasing the success rate of courses.&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Recent research on social media use has demonstrated that sentiment analysis can reveal a variety of behavioral and affective trends. For example, collective sentiment analysis has been adopted to find relationship between Twitter mood and both consumer confidence and political opinion[20] and stock market fluctuations [5].&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While the association between sentiment with summative course completion has been evaluated in prior work [24], and while the impact of other linguistic measures and social factors on attrition over time has been published as well[31, 26], this is the first work we know of that has brought this lens to explore what sentiment can tell us about drop out along the way in this type of environment. In particular, we explore this connection across three MOOCs in order to obtain a nuanced view into the ways in which sentiment is functioning similarly and differently or signaling similar and different things across these three courses.&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Adamopoulos [1] has applied sentiment analysis to collect students’ opinions towards MOOC features such as the course characteristics and university characteristics.&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learn to Program: The Fundamentals 3 , offered in August 2013&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brinton et al. [6] identified high decline rate and high-volume, noisy discussions as the two most salient features of MOOC forum activities. Ramesh et al. [24] use sentiment and subjectivity of user posts to predict engagement/disengagement. However, neither sentiment nor subjectivity was strongly predictive of engagement in that work.&amp;rdquo; (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Most of the prior work that addresses this question involved conducting surveys and interviews [25, 2].&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the opinion estimation step, for each set of posts that are related to a topic, we define the topic sentiment ratio xt on day t as the ratio of positive versus negative words used in that day’s post set. Positive and negative terms used in this paper are defined by the sentiment lexicon from [14], a word list containing about 2,000 and 4,800 words marked as positive and negative, respectively.&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In order to derive a more consistent signal, and following the same methodology used in previous work [20], we smooth the sentiment ratio with one of the simplest possible temporal smoothing techniques, a moving average over a window of past k days:&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;4.1.2 Results Part 1. Opinion towards the course&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The underlying assumption that students dropped out of courses because of sentiment may not be true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To objectively measure students’ opinions towards the course, we count how many students drop out of the course each day based on the students’ login information.&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To extract students’ aggregate opinions on a topic, we need to first identify posts relating to a topic (post retrieval step). Then we need to estimate the opinion of these posts (opinion estimation step).&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To decide which topic keywords to use for each course tool of interest, we run a distributional similarity technique called Brown clustering [7, 13] on all three courses’ posts in order to identify clusters of words that occur in similar contexts. It is conceptually similar to Latent Semantic Analysis, but is capable of identifying finer grained clusters of words.&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In all three courses, Course sentiment ratio is much higher during the last course week.&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Across all three courses, we observe a trend in the expected direction, namely that higher sentiment ratios are associated with fewer dropouts, which is significant in two out of the three courses(r = -0.25, p &amp;lt; 0.05 for the Teaching course; r = -0.12 for the Fantasy course(Figure 1(b)); r = -0.43, p &amp;lt; 0.01 for the Python course(Figure 1&amp;copy;)).&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;4.2 User-level Sentiment Analysis: Survival Analysis&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our goal in this section is to understand how expression of sentiment relates to attrition over time in the MOOCs on a user-level. We apply survival analysis to test if students’ attitudes as expressed in their posts or the ones they are exposed to correlate with dropout from the forum discussion.&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Part 2. Opinion towards the course tools&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is impossible for course instructors to read hundreds or even thousands of potentially related-posts. In this session, we try to extract the most prominent opinions associated with each course tool from these posts.&amp;rdquo; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;4.2.2 Modeling Survival analysis is a statistical modeling technique used to model the effect of one or more indicator variables at a time point on the probability of an event occurring on the next time point. In our case, we are modeling the effect of certain language behaviors (i.e., expression or exposure to expression of sentiment) on probability that a student drops out of the forum participation on the next time point. Survival models are a form of proportional odds logistic regression, and they are known to provide less biased estimates than simpler techniques (e.g., standard least squares linear regression) that do not take into account the potentially truncated nature of time-to-event data (e.g., users who had not yet ceased their participation at the time of the analysis but might at some point subsequently).&amp;rdquo; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As we see in Table 4, not only do we see differential effects across courses, we also see differential effects between behavior and exposure.&amp;rdquo; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Intuitively, we might expect that positive sentiment indicates that students are enjoying or benefitting from a course whereas negative sentiment might indicate that a student is frustrated with a course. The results from our quantitative analysis are not consistent with our intuition.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;6. LIMITATIONS&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The sentiment lexicon we utilize is designed for predicting sentiment polarity of product reviews.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The negative word use in this course is actually a sign of engagement because messages with negative words are more likely to be describing science fantasy related literature or even posting their own essay for suggestions.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Does this just simply implied the wrong algorithm was used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe an important implication for future research of forum discussion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Users who post messages like this are more in the role of forum content consumer. They may only be browsing the forum to look for answers for their particular problems without the intention of contributing content, such as solving the other’s problems.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emerging conversaon goes far beyond technologists (academic and commercial), to include researchers in educaon, leaders and policymakers, educaonal praconers, organisaonal administrators, instruconal designers, product vendors, and crically, the learners themselves (who are oen the first adopters of new cloud applicaons, many of which make data available, and who are the primary consumers of certain kinds of learning analyc). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Convergence of Macro, Meso and Micro-level Analytics (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macro-level analycs seek to enable crossinstuonal analycs, for instance, through ‘maturity’ surveys of current instuonal pracces11 or improving state-wide data access to standardized assessment data over students’ lifemes.12 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meso-level analycs operate at instuonal level. To the extent that educaonal instuons share common business processes to sectors already benefing from BI, they can be seen as a new BI market sector, who can usefully appropriate tools to integrate data silos in enterprise warehouses, opmize workflows, generate dashboards, mine unstructured data, beer predict ‘customer churn’ and future markets, and so forth. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micro-level analycs support the tracking and interpretaon of process-level data for individual learners (and by extension, groups). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the figure shows, what we now see taking place is the integraon of, and mutual enrichment between, these layers. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXAMPLES OF LEARNING ANALYTICS (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internaonal Conference on Learning Analycs &amp;amp; Knowledge (LAK) has archived proceedings and replayable presentaons which are the best snapshot of the emerging state of the art15 while EDUCAUSE is building a valuable resource bank and training events for educators/leaders/IT-administrators closer to immediate deployment opons.16 (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;educaonal startup companies are accelerang the pace at which learners will encounter micro-level analycs (e.g. the Educaonal Innovaon Summit17). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An EDUCAUSE synthesis of emerging trends in 20129 idenfies three kinds of predictors and indicators (Disposional, Acvity &amp;amp; Performance, and Student Arfacts), the key role of Visualizaon to support educaonal sensemaking (e.g. debate over what the analycs appear to be evidencing), and two kinds of intervenons (fully and semi-automated). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytics Dashboards (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictive Analytics (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adaptive Learning Analytics (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concept. Adapve learning plaorms build a model of a learner’s understanding of a specific topic (e.g. algebra; photosynthesis; dental surgical procedures), somemes in the context of standardised tests which dictate the curriculum and modes of tesng. This enables fine-grained feedback (e.g. which concepts you have grasped and at what level), and adapve presentaon of content (e.g. not showing material that depends on having mastered concepts the learner has failed on). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Network Analytics (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social network analysis (somemes called Organisaonal Network Analysis in corporate sengs) makes visible the structures and dynamics of interpersonal networks, to understand how people develop and maintain these relaons. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discourse Analytics (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMPACT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning: Towards a Data-Driven Science? (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEARNING ANALYTICS DEBATES (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Is Not Neutral (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent crique of the rhetoric around Big Data reminds us to enter this field with cauon:48 • Automang Research Changes the Definion of Knowledge • Claims to Objecvity and Accuracy are Misleading • Bigger Data are Not Always Beer Data • Not All Data Are Equivalent • Just Because it is Accessible Doesn’t Make it Ethical • Limited Access to Big Data Creates New Digital Divides (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of learning analycs, every step of the lifecycle — from data to analycs to insight to intervenon — is infused with human judgment. In short, it is as naïve to believe that ‘data speaks for itself’ as it is to believe that a text has a single, objecvely discernible meaning for all contexts. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Analytics Perpetuate Assessment Regimes (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since assessment regimes are a hotly contested issue within educaonal research and policy, by extension, an intelligent approach to learning analycs must engage with this debate, making clear what assessment regimes and pedagogical commitments a given learning analyc promotes. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the complexity of implemenng good assessment for learning,49 designing tools of this sort remains a primary challenge for learning analycs researchers.50, 51 The promise is that done well, analycs could be the key enabler for delivering formave assessment for learning at scale, placing new kinds of tools in the hands of learners.52 (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk is that research and development focuses on the data which is simplest to log computaonally, perpetuang the dominant pedagogies and learning outcomes from an industrial era, when most educaonal thought-leaders point to the addional disposions and skills needed for lifelong, lifewide learning, and the capacity to thrive in a very turbulent world. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethics (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the sharing and interpretaon of personal data (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who decides which data are important to log, how it is ‘cleaned’ for aggregaon with other datasets, and whether those datasets are compable? Who decide how the data are rendered visually, and are those seeing them literate enough to interpret them? Should learners see analycs about themselves, or their peers? Are teachers skilled enough to devise appropriate intervenons based on them? Can data be anonymised adequately, and can access be controlled appropriately? Are aempts to formalise educaonal theories to embed them in computaonal algorithms valid? (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments and instuons can use the possible introducon of analycs to catalyse debate on their vision for teaching and learning for the 21st Century. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instuons should train staff and researchers in the design and evaluaon of learning analytics (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should invest in analycs infrastructures for two reasons: (1) to opmise student success, and (2) to enable their own researchers to ask foundaonal quesons about learning and teaching in the 21st century. To research learning without an analycs infrastructure may soon become like a theorecal physicist with no access to CERN, or a genecist without genome databases. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Shum2012b&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shum, S. B., &amp;amp; Ferguson, R. (2012). Social learning analytics. Educational Technology and Society, 15(3), 3–26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics has its roots in two computing endeavours not specifically concerned with learning, but rather with strong business imperatives to understand internal organisational data, and external consumer behaviour. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational Data Mining (EDM) “an emerging discipline, concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from educational settings, and using those methods to better understand students, and the settings which they learn in” (Baker &amp;amp; Yacef, 2009). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational institutions have become increasingly interested in analysing the available datasets in order to support retention of students and to improve student results. This use of academic analytics stretches back for at least 50 years, but has become more significant in the last five years as datasets have grown larger and more easily available for analysis. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the first significant academic gathering of the learning analytics community was in 2011 at the 1st International Conference on Learning Analytics &amp;amp; Knowledge, doubling in size to 200 in 2012. The 2011 conference defined the term as follows: Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in contrast to more theoretical research or artificial experimentation which might be published in some of the above fields, there is an emphasis on impacting authentic learning from real-world contexts, through the use of practical tools. There is also a shift away from an institutional perspective towards a focus on the concerns of learners and teachers. The main beneficiaries are no longer considered to be administrators, funders, marketing departments and education authorities, but instead are learners, teachers and faculty members (Long &amp;amp; Siemens, 2011). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of social learning analytics (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a literature analysis of the field, we found that in the discourse of academic analytics there is little mention of pedagogy, theory, learning or teaching (Ferguson, 2012). This reflects the roots of these analytics in management information systems and business intelligence (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance indicators in educational settings typically involve outcomes-centric analytics based on learners’ performance on predefined tasks. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Learning Analytics (SLA) are strongly grounded in learning theory and focus attention on elements of learning that are relevant when learning in a participatory online culture. They shift attention away from summative assessment of individuals’ past performance in order to render visible, and in some cases potentially actionable, behaviours and patterns in the learning environment that signify effective process. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Learning Analytics is, we propose, a distinctive subset of learning analytics that draws on the substantial body of work demonstrating that new skills and ideas are not solely individual achievements, but are developed, carried forward, and passed on through interaction and collaboration (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A socio-cultural strand of educational research demonstrates that language is one of the primary tools through which learners construct meaning. Its use is influenced by their aims, feelings and relationships, all of which shift according to context (Wells &amp;amp; Claxton, 2002). Another socio-cultural strand of research emphasises that learning cannot be understood by focusing solely on the cognition, development or behaviour of individual learners; neither can it be understood without reference to its situated nature (Gee, 1997; Wertsch, 1991). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Learning Analytics should render learning processes visible and actionable at different scales: from national and international networks to small groups and individual learners. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of open, social learning (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;analytics focused on summative assessment of performance remain important but do not go far enough: we need to develop new sets of analytics that can be used to support learning and teaching in these new conditions. We summarise these phenomena as: technological drivers the shift to ‘free’ and ‘open’ demand for knowledge-age skills innovation requires social learning challenges to educational institutions. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand for knowledge-age skills Technology is always appropriated to serve what people believe to be their needs and values. Since 1991, we have lived in the “knowledge age”—a period in which knowledge, rather than labour, land or capital, has been the key wealth-generating resource (Savage, 1996). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes have prompted an interest in “knowledge-age skills” that will allow learners to become both confident and competent designers of their own learning goals (Claxton, 2002). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characterising online social learning (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social learning has been conceptualised as societal learning in general, as processes of interaction that lead to concerted action for change, as group learning, and as the learning of individuals within a social context (Blackmore, 2010). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OERs greatly increase the amount of good quality material available online to learners, another consequence can be that individual learners find themselves adrift in an ocean of information, struggling to solve ill-structured problems, with little clear idea of how to solve them, or how to recognise when they have solved them. At the same time, distributed networks of learners are grappling with ‘wicked problems’ such as climate change, which offer the same challenges on a grander scale. Social learning infrastructure could have a key role to play in these situations, helping learners connect with others who can provide emotional and conceptual support for locating and engaging with resources, just as in our tree story at the start of this section. This forces us to ask whether our current educational and training regimes are fit for purpose in equipping our children, students and workforce with the dispositions and skills needed under conditions of growing uncertainty—a challenge explored in detail by many others, for example in the collection edited by Deakin Crick (2009). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online social learning can take place when people are able to: clarify their intention—learning rather than browsing ground their learning—by defining their question/problem, and experimenting engage in learning conversations—increasing their understanding. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1. Dimensions of the social learning design space (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inherently social learning analytics (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inherently social analytics—only make sense in a collective context: Social Network Analytics—interpersonal relationships define social platforms and link learners to contacts, resources and ideas. Discourse Analytics—language is a primary tool for knowledge negotiation and construction. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socialised analytics—although these are relevant as personal analytics, they have important new attributes in a collective context: Content Analytics—user-generated content is one of the defining characteristics of Web 2.0 (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disposition Analytics—intrinsic motivation to learn lies at the heart of engaged learning and innovation Context Analytics—mobile computing is transforming access to people, content and both formal and informal learning. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman and his colleagues (2007) provide a definition of context that allows the definition of the context of an entity (for example, a learner) depending on five distinct categories: Individuality context includes information about the entity within the context. In the case of learners, this might include their language, their behaviour, their preferences and their goals Time context includes points in times, ranges and histories so can take into account work flow, long-term courses and interaction histories Location context can include absolute location, location in relation to people or resources, or virtual location (IP address) Activity context is concerned with goals, tasks and actions Relations context captures the relations of an entity with other entities, of example with learners, teachers and resources. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early work in context-aware computing treated the environment as a shell encasing the user and focused on scalar properties such as current time and location, together with a list of available objects and services (see, for example, Abowd, Atkeson, Hong, Long, &amp;amp; Pinkerton, 1997; Want, Hopper, Falcao, &amp;amp; Gibbons, 1992). The focus was on the individual user receiving data from an environment rather than interacting with it. This model did not acknowledge the dynamics of interaction between people and the environment. When considered in the context of learning, it did not provide information that could help people to modify their environment in order to create supportive workspaces or form social networks with those around them or accessible online (Brown et al., 2010). (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of powerful analytics (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bowker and Star (2000) demonstrate how these become the mechanisms by which we choose not only how to remember, but also systematically forget, what is known. If a phenomenon is not visible within a classification scheme, it is systematically erased. The issue of power is, therefore, a central one to confront. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for learning analytics is more complex still. As described above, at least some forms of learning analytics research have an interest in using data generated by users as a by-product of online activity (for example, asking/answering questions, or recommending resources), rather than as an intentional form of evidence of learning (such as taking a test or submitting an essay). (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important concerns (boyd &amp;amp; Crawford, 2011) are beginning to be expressed about learning analytics, such as the following variants on longstanding debates at the intersection of education, technology and artificial intelligence: Analytics are dependent on computational platforms that use, re-use and merge learner data, both public and private: institutions should steer clear of open data and minimise the merging of datasets of any sort until there are much clearer ethical and legal guidelines. Analytics could disempower learners, making them increasingly reliant on institutions providing them with continuous feedback, rather than developing meta-cognitive and learning-to-learn skills and dispositions. Analytics are a crude way to operationalise proxy measures of teacher effectiveness, and will be used to compare and contrast student outcomes, leading to the gaming of the system: “learning and teaching to the analytic” to maintain performance indicators that do not genuinely promote meaningful learning. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If SLA tools and data are placed in the hands of learners, the balance of power shifts significantly. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If analytics are drawing learners’ attention to their development as self-aware, intrinsically motivated learners, they are being moved in the opposite direction to becoming passively dependent on the institution or platform to tell them how they are doing and what to do next. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If analytics are focused on providing formative feedback to improve learning process, rather than making automated judgments about mastery levels in a given subject, there might be fewer concerns around the removal of human mentors from the feedback loop. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges facing LA as a field are also reviewed, particularly regarding the need to increase the scope of data capture so that the complexity of the learning process can be more accurately reflected in analysis. Privacy and data ownership will become increasingly important for all participants in analytics projects. (p. 1380)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When P. W. Anderson stated in 1972 that “more is different,” he argued that the quantity of an entity influences how researchers engage with it. (p. 1381)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on large quantities of data for discovery has important implications for education. (p. 1381)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for researchers, learning sciences, and education in general, data trails offer an opportunity to explore learning from new and multiple angles. (p. 1381)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view that data and analytics offer a new mode of thinking and a new model of discovery is at least partially rooted in the artificial intelligence and machine learning fields. (p. 1381)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article reviews the historical developments of learning analytics as a field, tools and techniques used by practitioners and researchers, and challenges with broadening the scope of data capture, modeling knowledge domains, and building organizational capacity to use analytics. (p. 1382)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining Learning Analytics and Tracing Historical Roots (p. 1382)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the following definition offered in the 1st International Conference on Learning Analytics: Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for the purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs.1 (p. 1382)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other definitions are less involved and draw language from business intelligence: Analytics is the process of developing actionable insights through problem definition and the application of statistical models and analysis against existing and/or simulated future data. (Cooper, 2012b) (p. 1382)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where LA is more concerned with sensemaking and action, educational data mining (EDM) is more focused toward developing methods for “exploring the unique types of data that come from educational settings”.2 Although the techniques used are similar in both fields, EDM has a more specific focus on reductionist analysis (Siemens &amp;amp; Baker, 2012). As LA draws from and extends EDM methodologies (Bienkowski, Feng, &amp;amp; Means, 2012, p. 14), it is a reasonable expectation that the future development of analytic techniques and tools from both communities will overlap. (p. 1382)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytics in education can also be viewed as existing in various levels, ranging from individual classroom, department, university, region, state/province, and international. (p. 1382)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical Contributions to LA (p. 1383)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a brief summary of the diversity of fields and research activities within education that have contributed to the development of learning analytics: (p. 1383)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LS&lt;br /&gt;
 Surprised that the field of learning sciences did not get mentioned by Siemens. (p. 1384)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;academic analytics involved the adoption of business intelligence (BI) to the academic sector (Goldstein, 2005). While sometimes referred to as LA, the BI roots of academic analytics are more concerned with improving organizational processes, such as personnel management or resource allocation, and improving efficiency within the university. (p. 1384)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LA Tools, Techniques, and Applications (p. 1384)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools (p. 1385)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rough classification&lt;br /&gt;
 Dividing LA tools by commercial and free/research sounds rough to me. Because there are so many tools that could be potentially applied to LA, the boundary is not always clearcut. And having this dichotomy does not contribute much to our thinking over LA tools. (p. 1385)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics tools can be broadly grouped into two categories: commercial and research. (p. 1385)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several prominent analytics tools already rely on data captured in an LMS. For example, Purdue University’s Signals (Arnold, 2010) and University of Maryland–Baltimore County’s “Check My Activity” (Fritz, 2010) both rely on data generated in Blackboard. Recommender systems, such as Degree Compass (Denley, 2012), similarly draw on data captured in existing information technology systems in universities. (p. 1385)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techniques and Applications (p. 1386)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LA has two overlapping components: techniques and applications. Techniques involve the specific algorithms and models for conducting analytics. Applications involve the ways in which techniques are used to impact and improve teaching and learning. (p. 1386)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinction between technique and an application is not absolute but instead reflects the focus of researchers. (p. 1386)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both, however, are important in advancing LA as a field. (p. 1386)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker and Yacef (2009) address the technique dimension of LA/EDM in listing five primary areas of analysis: •• Prediction •• Clustering •• Relationship mining •• Distillation of data for human judgment •• Discovery with models Bienkowski, Feng, and Means (2012) offer five areas of LA/EDM application: •• Modeling user knowledge, behavior, and experience •• Creating profiles of users •• Modeling knowledge domains •• Trend analysis •• Personalization and adaptation (p. 1386)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker and Yacef’s model details various types of data mining activity that the researcher conducts, whereas Bienkowski et al.’s model is focused on application. (p. 1386)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1. Historical influences in development of learning analytics. (p. 1387)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scope of Data Capture (p. 1387)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, LA has relied heavily on two sources: student information systems (SIS; in generating learner profiles) and learning management systems (in tracking learner behavior and using it for prediction). (p. 1387)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“sensor-based modeling of human communication networks” (Choudhury &amp;amp; Pentland, 2003) (p. 1387)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1. Learning Analytics (LA) Techniques and Applications. (p. 1388)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other approaches include “passive acquisition” of “physical activity data” through “pedometers, heart rate monitors, accelerometers, and distance trackers” (Lee &amp;amp; Thomas, 2011, p. 867) (p. 1388)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecture hall data are limited to a few variables: who attended, seating patterns, student response system data, and observational data recorded by faculty or teaching assistants. By contrast, when learners watch a video lecture, data sources are richer, including frequency of access, playback, pauses, and so on. (p. 1389)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Domain Modeling (p. 1389)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the authors argue for the need for “data structures and computational techniques” (Hendler &amp;amp; Berners Lee, 2010, p. 158) to enable human-computer interactions that provide a new level of intelligence and problem solving. (p. 1389)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once knowledge domains have been articulated or mapped, learner data, profile information, and curricular data can be brought together and analyzed to determine learner knowledge in relation to the knowledge structure of a discipline. (p. 1389)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational Capacity (p. 1390)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, effective analytics practices require organizational support. If analytics is to have an impact on how a university supports its learners, great interand intrainstitutional collaborations are required. (p. 1390)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;faculty support and navigating “the realities of university culture” (p. 160). The insights gained through analytics require broad support organizationally. Prior to launching a project, organizations will benefit from taking stock of their capacity for analytics and willingness to have analytics have an impact on existing processes. In this context, Greller and Drachsler (2012, p. 43) outline six dimensions that must be considered “to ensure appropriate exploitation of LA in an educationally beneficial way”: •• Stakeholders: Those who are interested in or impacted by analytics •• Objectives: Goal or intent of analytics •• Data: Data sets and sources •• Instruments: Tools and technologies •• External limitations: Ethical, legal, managerial/organizational •• Internal limitations: Acceptance of analytics and skill level or competencies to perform analytics within an organization (p. 1391)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective process and operation of learning analytics require institutional change that does not just address the technical challenges linked to data mining, data models, server load, and computation but also addresses the social complexities of application, sensemaking, privacy, and ethics alongside the development of a shared organizational culture framed in analytics. (p. 1391)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2. Learning analytics model. (p. 1392)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAM includes seven components: collection, storage, data cleaning, integration, analysis, representation and visualization, and action. (p. 1392)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges (p. 1392)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant challenges facing analytics in education are not technical. Concerns about data quality, sufficient scope of the data captured to reflect accurately the learning experience, privacy, and ethics of analytics are among the most significant concerns (see Slade &amp;amp; Prinsloo, 2013). (p. 1392)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Quality and Scope (p. 1392)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data interoperability “imposes a challenge to data mining and analytics that rely on diverse and distributed data” (Bienkowski et al., 2012, p. 38) (p. 1393)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suthers and Rosen (2011) capture the challenge when stating “since interaction is distributed across space, time, and media, and the data comes in a variety of formats, there is no single transcript to inspect and share, and the available data representations may not make interaction and its consequences apparent” (p. 65). (p. 1393)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy (p. 1394)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With interactions online reflecting a borderless and global world for information flow, any approach to data exchange and data privacy requires a global view (World Economic Forum, 2011, p. 33). (p. 1394)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ownership of, and access to, data is only one aspect that educators need to consider. (p. 1394)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of data presents a secondary concern. Who has access to analytics? Should a student be able to see what an institution sees? Given variations in privacy laws, should educators be able to see the analytics performed on students in different courses? On graduation, should analytics be made available to prospective employees? When a learner transfers to a different program or a different university, what happens to his or her data? How long does a university keep those data, and can they be shared with other universities? These and numerous equally intractable problems will need to be addressed. (p. 1394)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dark Side (p. 1395)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential of LA to provide educators with actionable insight into teaching and learning is clear. The implications of heavy reliance on analytics are less clear. Ellul (1964) stated that technique and technical processes strive for the “mechanization of everything it encounters” (p. 12). Ellul’s comments remind us of the need to keep human and social processes central in LA activities. (p. 1395)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learning process is essentially social and cannot be completely reduced to algorithms. (p. 1395)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learning process is creative, requiring the generation of new ideas, approaches, and concepts. Analytics, in contrast, is about identifying and revealing what already exists. (p. 1395)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sinha, S., Rogat, T. K., Adams-Wiggins, K. R., &amp;amp; Hmelo-Silver, C. E. (2015). Collaborative group engagement in a computer-supported inquiry learning environment. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 10(3), 273–307. doi:10.1007/s11412-015-9218-y&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the quality of engagement (p. 273)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the quality of behavioral and social engagement differentiated groups demonstrating low quality engagement, but cognitive and conceptual-to-consequential forms are required for explaining high quality engagement. (p. 273)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In CSCL settings, the extent to which collaboration is productive in ways that lead to conceptual understanding depends on high quality engagement in shared activity. (p. 274)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extant research and operationalization limit our understanding of deep-level engagement in CSCL contexts. Existing studies have operationalized engagement as a single facet, yielding a narrow view of engagement and the interaction among these facets (i.e., behavioral, emotional, cognitive) (Fredricks et al. 2004; Ryu and Lombardi 2015). (p. 274)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second issue is that engagement has typically been evaluated at a single time point, with limited information provided about its evolving nature during task activity and over time. In addition, survey and observational measures of engagement evaluate individual learners, rather than shared engagement (Fredricks et al. 2004). (p. 274)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, engagement has primarily been operationalized as general in regards to the task and classroom context, providing a decontextualized understanding of engagement. (p. 274)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research is conducted in the context of middle school students learning about ecosystems (Eberbach et al. 2012; Jordan et al. 2013, 2014). This research is particularly timely as systems are key crosscutting concepts in current science standards (NGSS 2013), but remain challenging for learners because of the dynamic multi-level nature of systems (HmeloSilver and Azevedo 2006; Hmelo-Silver et al. 2007). (p. 275)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building from Gresalfi’s notion of consequential engagement (Gresalfi et al. 2009), we use conceptual-to-consequential engagement to reflect how groups engage with ideas such that their application has consequences for solving a contextualized problem in a CSCL environment. (p. 275)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement in CSCL environments (p. 275)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement is central to understanding how to foster conceptual understanding because engagement mediates the relationship between motivation and learning (Blumenfeld et al. 2006). (p. 275)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guiding theoretical framework is consistent with Fredricks et al. (2004) in three primary ways. First, we consider engagement to be a multi-faceted construct that unites varying forms of engagement in meaningful ways as a Bmeta-construct^ (Fredricks et al. 2004, p. 60). (p. 275)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we assume that there are qualitative differences in the degree of engagement for each component. (p. 276)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, engagement is responsive to context, with the specific context encompassing the CSCL environment, acknowledging that this immediate learning context is necessarily nested within a larger classroom, instructional, and curricular context. (p. 276)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, we need to build from this conceptualization to account for the group as the unit of analysis. A consideration of collective engagement necessitates an examination of social interactions among students and the shared nature of their engagement. (p. 276)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what follows, we define each dimension of engagement, and review research related to engagement in collaborative groups and/or conducted within CSCL environments. (p. 276)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioral engagement Behavioral engagement involves sustained on-task behavior during academic activity, including indicators such as persistence, effort, and contributing to the task (Fredricks et al. 2004). (p. 276)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual learners who withdraw their participation from group discussion can undermine learning, due to lost opportunities for collaboration or by provoking whole group disengagement (Van den Bossche et al. 2006). (p. 276)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with this definition, studies of student engagement within CSCL have primarily employed measures consistent with this engagement facet, measuring students’ participation given number of contributions (Lipponen et al. 2003), length of posts in online environments (Guzdial and Turns 2000), or whether contributions are more social (i.e., off-task) rather than around content ideas (Stahl 2000). (p. 276)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social engagement Our inclusion of social engagement extends beyond the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement distinctions made by Fredricks and her colleagues (Fredricks et al. 2004) to account for social interactions within small groups. Drawing from Linnenbrink-Garcia et al. (2011), we define social engagement as referring to quality of group socio-emotional interaction.1 Quality social engagement involves respectful and responsive interactions among members of the group. Social engagement also reflects group cohesion, or evidence that the task is conceptualized as a team effort, rather than an as an individual activity. (p. 276)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, quality social interactions reflect equitable participation in which all teammates contributions are taken up (Barron 2003; Rogat and Adams-Wiggins 2015). (p. 277)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research highlights that groups often face difficulty finding common ground and may lack shared understanding (Dillenbourg et al. 2009). Negative social interactions can come to predominate group activity, and compete for limited attentional resources (Barron 2003). In worst cases, low quality social interactions can devolve into battles related to status differences and can promote inequity (Salomon and Globerson 1989). (p. 277)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;respectful, responsive, and cohesive interactions elevate the quality of joint task work (Engle and Conant 2002; Webb et al. 2006). Further, positive social interactions can facilitate higher quality cognitive engagement by helping ensure that feedback from monitoring was communicated well, supported joint and inclusive planning (Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2011). (p. 277)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive engagement Fredricks and her colleagues (2004) indicate that there are two primary conceptualizations of cognitive engagement, both in terms of investment in schooling (e.g., Connell and Wellborn 1990) as well as being a strategic and self-regulated learner (e.g., Pintrich and De Groot 1990). (p. 277)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socially shared regulation refers to multiple group members regulating and coordinating their joint activity (Vauras et al. 2003). Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia (2011) used the cognitive (p. 277)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sub-processes from a self-regulated learning perspective to understand and elaborate the quality variation of collaborative groups engaging in shared planning and monitoring. (p. 278)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited research has investigated how groups effectively regulate within CSCL environments (Järvelä and Hadwin 2013). We know that computersupported learning can support and enhance students’ use of regulatory processes (Azevedo 2005). Socially shared regulation research has demonstrated the presence of frequent and at times extended use of regulatory processes within synchronous and asynchronous CSCL environments (Iiskala et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2015). (p. 278)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;groups exhibiting moderate to low quality cognitive engagement during planning or monitoring may demonstrate a focus on superficial features, such as brief planning discussions or a focus on color or neatness, with implications for challenges reaching consequential engagement via the technology tools. (p. 278)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptual-to-consequential engagement Our introduction of conceptual-to-consequential (CC) engagement provides an important extension to the forms synthesized in Fredricks et al. review (2004). CC engagement refers to making progress in solving meaningful problems through the use of domain-specific content and disciplinary practices as conceptual tools (Gresalfi and Barab 2010; Gresalfi et al. 2009). (p. 278)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequential engagement also specifies an active and agentic role for learners to justify identified solutions, particularly after having weighed and critiqued alternative solutions to the problem. In this way, consequential engagement builds from the connections and synthesis, as well as regulation, from cognitive engagement, toward a reflection of connecting to something larger. (p. 278)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extant research has suggested that students’ connections between conceptual ideas and a broader context can be lower quality, shown by simple knowledge telling with limited connections (Scardamalia and Bereiter 1996; Chernobilsky et al. 2004), to moderate quality showcasing connections among content ideas (conceptual engagement or sense making), to higher quality linkages among content ideas with prior knowledge, everyday experiences, and/or the context of the larger problem (i.e., consequential engagement). Thus, we extend this construct by including conceptual engagement as part of a continuum that should culminate in consequential engagement. (p. 278)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They note that contexts and practices that Bemphasize making connections can only lead to robust learning when they are supported by tasks that create opportunities for students to grapple with the meaning and utility of content^ (Gresalfi and Barab 2010, p. 301). (p. 278)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current study (p. 279)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines a multi-faceted, dynamic, shared, and contextualized conceptualization of engagement within a CSCL environment using our newly developed observation protocol. Toward this end, we initially explored quality variation in ten collaborative groups’ behavioral, social, cognitive and conceptual-to-consequential engagement using quality ratings. This was followed by coupling in-depth qualitative analysis and contrasting cases of two groups characterized by high or low quality engagement relative to the sample with the intent of describing engagement quality, the fluctuation in engagement quality during the lesson, and the interrelationships among engagement facets. In developing these cases, we prepared narratives that thickly described each engagement dimension in 5-minute intervals and visual representations of each group’s engagement ratings across a lesson. We also examined each group’s final explanatory model that was the subject of the observed lesson. A final analytic focused on case group comparison. (p. 279)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Question: How does a multifaceted, shared, dynamic and situated conceptualization of engagement serve as an observational tool for studying CSCL? (p. 279)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 279)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students participated as part of a technology-intensive curriculum designed to support 7thgraders’ learning about aquatic ecosystems (Hmelo-Silver et al. 2011). (p. 279)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this study we focused on the pond unit, with the driving question on investigating causes for fish death in a local pond. (p. 279)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classroom instruction was a mix of whole class and small group activities organized around components-mechanisms-phenomena (CMP). CMP is a conceptual representation adapted from Structure-Behavior-Function theory (Vattam et al. 2011; Hmelo-Silver et al. 2007; see also Quellmalz et al. 2009). In brief, phenomena are the problems or patterns to be explained (here, the sudden fish death in the pond). Components are the individual entities in the system (e.g., fish), and mechanisms are characterized as causal explanations of how phenomena occur or how significant processes work (e.g., cellular respiration). (p. 280)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies (p. 280)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simulations, modeling tools and hypermedia were an integral part of the curriculum that promoted the usage of CMP as a conceptual tool to make sense of problems in the aquatic ecosystem. (p. 280)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten videotaped collaborative groups are the focus of this research. (p. 280)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each group consisted of three to four students. (p. 280)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures (p. 281)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we developed an observation protocol designed to evaluate collaborative group engagement using four dimensions (p. 281)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each engagement dimension, a rating of low, moderate, or high (range 1–3) was assigned to reflect quality of group engagement (see Table 1). (p. 283)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observations were segmented into 5-minute intervals, beginning when collaborative group activity was initiated (i.e., excluding teacher directions; whole class discussion). (p. 283)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data analysis (p. 284)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a second set of qualitative analyses, we sought to construct a rich description of collaborative groups’ engagement quality when working with the technology tools, with three primary emphases. First, we aimed to differentiate low and high quality collaborative engagement using thick descriptions through the analysis of two groups. Second, we aimed to explore the interrelationships among engagement dimensions in regards to their reciprocal influence during group interactions. Finally, we sought to analyze how engagement quality and the interrelations among dimensions unfolded over the course of group activity during a lesson. (p. 284)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 286)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement quality across groups (p. 286)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlations (p. 286)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, although behavioral engagement was correlated with social and cognitive engagement, it had only a moderate correlation with conceptual-to-consequential engagement. (p. 286)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CC engagement was significantly related to cognitive engagement and moderately related to social engagement. (p. 286)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mean engagement scores (p. 286)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these descriptive statistics illuminated between-group differences, suggesting substantial quality variation in engagement across the ten groups. (p. 286)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drew on the means to identify groups 6 and 10 for follow-up case analyses (p. 286)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality of collaborative group engagement: contrasting cases (p. 287)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioral engagement Group 6 frequently engaged in off-task conversations, reflecting a decision for only one group member to use the EMT software and add to the model at a time. (p. 288)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social engagement Social engagement during model creation and revision was primarily moderate. (p. 289)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This use of BI^ shows a focus on individual thinking, and a conceptualization of the work as individual activity, rather than collaborative. (p. 289)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another indicator of low quality social engagement was that even when group members’ contributions were solicited and/or shared, these ideas were not consistently taken up for discussion or further incorporated into the group model. (p. 290)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, low quality planning yielded activity that focused on listing factors responsible for low oxygen levels in the water, rather than developing an explanatory model for causes of sudden fish death. (p. 291)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptual-to-consequential engagement (p. 292)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundamental challenge relevant to CC was that the group’s work on the modeling activity did not seem to connect to the larger unit problem explaining fish death in a pond, but remained narrowly focused on a single factor. (p. 292)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, Group 6 did not seem to use the available conceptual, scientific, and instructional resources in consequential ways to solve the larger problem of fish death in the local pond. (p. 292)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The separate examination of each engagement dimension was an important step in understanding the challenges faced by Group 6. In this final section, we consider how the mutual influence among dimensions explains Group 6’s lower quality engagement. (p. 292)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High quality engagement case (p. 293)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group 10 displayed moderate-high level social engagement over the course of the lesson. The group’s social interaction can be characterized by Matt taking on a role in facilitating the group’s responses on their shared model. (p. 294)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some instances, Matt employed the use of I when introducing his idea, but then returned to using Bwe^, suggesting some sensitivity to acknowledging the import of the collective or group. (p. 294)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tension and difficulty with Matt’s perceived direction during group work resulted in some disrespectful exchanges marked by mimicking and ignoring. (p. 294)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their planning discussion (p. 294)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This planning was in response to monitoring when the group was discussing more general causes of fish death based on their outside knowledge: (p. 295)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptual-to-consequential engagement Group 10 can be differentiated by their maintained high quality CC engagement. (p. 295)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Group 10’s maintained focus on explaining fish death, this excerpt highlights that they consistently worked to ensure their model could be justified using the evidence drawn from the resources. (p. 297)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;discussing mechanistic behaviors of those components in the context of the given problem. (p. 298)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, this group showed consistent high-level behavioral and social engagement. It seems likely that because the group maintained on-task participation, they were able to maintain a shared focus on improving their conceptual artifact (the EMT model). Further, under Matt’s facilitating role within the group, group member’s contributions and perspectives were respected and considered for inclusion in the explanatory model. Here, both BE and SE seemed to be a critical undercurrent for reaching high levels of CE and CC. (p. 298)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second pattern concerned the interrelated nature of CE and CC, with high quality cognitive engagement proving central to promoting and sustaining the group’s consequential engagement. (p. 298)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 298)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpacking group engagement in CSCL contexts (p. 300)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developed an observational protocol that operationalized engagement using four dimensions. (p. 300)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings have implications for how we conceptualize the relations among forms of engagement. In particular, our results suggest interrelations among behavioral, social, and cognitive forms of engagement, with subsequent influence for groups’ CC engagement. (p. 301)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we provide a review of Group 10’s case that builds toward these points. First, for Group 10, we see on-task participation and a positive climate as setting the stage for higher quality CE and CC engagement. Here, broad participation and sustained on-task engagement ensured mutual attention over the course of activity. Further, positive socio-emotional interactions, reflective of responsive interactions and the equitable solicitation of ideas, ensured that group member’s ideas were taken up and integrated within the group response. It is notable that the resulting positive interactions and inclusiveness required continued effort by Matt to ensure that there was agreement among group members related to the components and relationships integrated into their shared explanatory model. Future research should continue to examine the role of social engagement for engagement quality and more generally for group activity. (p. 301)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Group 10’s deep-level engagement was more than everyone’s participation and responsive interactions. It was our addition of CE and CC that enriched and elaborated our description of the deep-level engagement showcased by Group 10. Future research should explore the threshold at which behavioral and social engagement must be attained in order to sustain high quality CE and CC engagement. (p. 301)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we can also see consequential engagement as related to the synergistic influence of these engagement dimensions, (p. 301)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our findings culminate in a synergistic view of engagement (also see Rogat and Linnenbrink-Garcia 2013). Our results give primacy to the highly interrelated and mutually influencing nature of these four dimensions of engagement. (p. 302)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implications for design and instruction (p. 302)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our findings, we present suggestions for refining the design of these technologies to promote groups’ cognitive and conceptual-to-consequential engagement. (p. 302)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built-in prompts can appear on the screen when groups add new components or write explanations connecting two components. (p. 302)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, designers need to carefully consider the conditions under which those prompts might appear to create a balance between encouraging thoughtfulness and interfering in the flow of the collaborative work. (p. 302)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that groups worked on model creation synchronously, it may have been a challenge for the teachers to monitor the conceptual and scientific practice understanding, as well as progress made by each group. (p. 302)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a general concern that schools do not give students opportunities to engage with curricular content in conceptually and consequentially meaningful ways (Gresalfi et al. 2009). (p. 302)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study is important to the field of CSCL as it adds to the literature on inter-subjective meaning making (Koschmann et al. 2003, Koshmann et al. 2005, Rochelle 1996; Stahl 2004; Suthers 2006). (p. 303)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions CSCL environments are complex and attempts at understanding them need complex conceptualizations of how and whether groups take up the technological affordances in productive ways (e.g., Kapur et al. 2011; Teasley 2011). We argue that to richly conceptualize collaborative engagement in computer-supported contexts we need to draw on a multi-faceted, shared, and contextualized operationalization that extends beyond participation and group socio-emotional interactions. Our results show that these forms of engagement are interrelated and that the quality is mutually influential. Moreover, high conceptual-to-consequential (CC) engagement is facilitated by the synergistic influence of behavioral, social, and cognitive engagement dimensions. The CC dimension is especially important in computer-supported inquiry learning because we want learners to use the technology to go beyond building knowledge for its own sake (Chan 2013). Rather, the goal is knowledge building for action in which learners use knowledge as a tool for thinking (Hmelo et al. 1998). (p. 303)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slade, S., &amp;amp; Prinsloo, P. (2013). Learning analytics: Ethical issues and dilemmas. American Behavioral Scientist, 57(10), 1510–1529. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1177&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;0002764213479366&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article proposes a sociocritical perspective on the use of learning analytics. Such an approach highlights the role of power, the impact of surveillance, the need for transparency, and an acknowledgment that student identity is a transient, temporal, and context-bound construct. Each of these affects the scope and definition of learning analytics’ ethical use. We propose six principles as a framework for considerations to guide higher education institutions to address ethical issues in learning analytics and challenges in context-dependent and appropriate ways. (p. 1510)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the field of learning analytics, discussions around the ethical implications of increasing an institution’s scrutiny of student data typically relate to ownership of that data and to student privacy issues. (p. 1511)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaches taken to understand the opportunities and ethical challenges of learning analytics necessarily depend on a range of ideological assumptions and epistemologies. For example, if we approach learning analytics from the perspective of resource optimization in the context of the commoditization of higher education (Hall &amp;amp; Stahl, 2012), the ethical issues appear different from those resulting from a sociocritical perspective. In addition, learning analytics has evolved from a range of research areas such as social network analysis, latent semantic analysis, and dispositions analysis (Ferguson, 2012). Each of these domains has its own, often overlapping, ethical guidelines and codes of conduct that address similar concerns such as the ownership of data, privacy, consumer or patient consent, and so on. (p. 1511)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this article, we situate learning analytics within an understanding of power relations among learners, higher education institutions, and other stakeholders (e.g., regulatory and funding frameworks). Such power relations can be considered from the perspective of Foucault’s Panopticon, where structural design allows a central authority to oversee all activity. In the case of learning analytics, such oversight or surveillance is often available only to the institution, course designers, and faculty, and not to the student (Land &amp;amp; Bayne, 2005). (p. 1511)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sociocritical perspective entails being critically aware of the way our cultural, political, social, physical, and economic contexts and power relationships shape our responses to the ethical dilemmas and issues in learning analytics (see, e.g., Apple, 2004). Ethical issues for learning analytics fall into the following broad, often overlapping categories: 1. The location and interpretation of data 2. Informed consent, privacy, and the deidentification of data 3. The management, classification, and storage of data (p. 1511)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such ethical issues are not unique to education, and similar debates relating to the use of data to inform decisions and interventions are also found in the health sector (Cooper, 2009; Dolan, 2008; Snaedal, 2002), human resource management (Cokins, 2009), talent management (Davenport, Harris, &amp;amp; Shapiro, 2010), homeland security (Seifert, 2004), and biopolitics (Dillon &amp;amp; Loboguerrero, 2008). Of specific concern here are the implications of viewing learning analytics as moral practice (p. 1511)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perspectives on Ethical Issues in Learning Analytics (p. 1512)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oblinger (2012) differentiates between learning analytics and approaches including business intelligence and academic analytics, defining learning analytics as focusing on “students and their learning behaviors, gathering data from course management and student information systems in order to improve student success” (p. 11). (p. 1512)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Overview of the Purposes and Collection of Educational Data (p. 1512)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethical challenges and issues in the use of educational data can be usefully viewed in the context of the history of Internet research ethics (p. 1512)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, there are a growing number of ethical issues regarding the collection and analyses of educational data, issues that include greater understanding and transparency regarding the “purposes for which data is being collected and how sensitive data will be handled” (Oblinger, 2012, p. 12). Legal frameworks such as the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act focus largely on how information is used outside an institution rather than on its use within the institution, and Oblinger (2012) argues that it is crucial that institutions inform students “what information about them will be used for what purposes, by whom, and for what benefit” (p. 12). (p. 1513)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subotzky and Prinsloo (2011) suggest that there is a need for a reciprocal sharing of appropriate and actionable knowledge between students and the delivering institution. Such knowledge of students may facilitate the offering of just-in-time and customized support, allowing students to make more informed choices and act accordingly. (p. 1513)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Educational Purpose of Learning Analytics (p. 1513)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;higher education “has traditionally been inefficient in its data use, often operating with substantial delays in analyzing readily evident data and feedback” (Long &amp;amp; Siemens, 2011, p. 32). (p. 1513)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booth (2012) emphasizes that learning analytics also has the potential to serve learning. A learning analytics approach may make education both personal and relevant and allow students to retain their own identities within the bigger system. Optimal use of student-generated data may result in institutions having an improved comprehension of the lifeworlds and choices of students, allowing both institution and students to make better and informed choices and respond faster to actionable and identified needs (Oblinger, 2012). (p. 1513)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several authors (Bienkowski, Feng, &amp;amp; Means, 2012; Campbell, DeBlois, &amp;amp; Oblinger, 2007) refer to the obligation that institutions have to act on knowledge gained through analytics. (p. 1513)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the emphasis on the role of data and analyses for reporting on student success, retention, and throughput, it is crucial to remember that learning analytics has huge potential to primarily serve learning (Kruse &amp;amp; Pongsajapan, 2012). When institutions emphasize the analysis and use of data primarily for reporting purposes, there is a danger of seeing students as passive producers of data, resulting in learning analytics used as “intrusive advising” (Kruse &amp;amp; Pongsajapan, 2012, p. 2). (p. 1514)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power and Surveillance in Learning Analytics (p. 1514)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owing to the inherently unequal power relations in the use of data generated by students in their learning journey, we propose a sociocritical framework that allows us to address a range of ethical questions such as levels of visibility, aggregation, and surveillance. (p. 1514)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawson (2006), for example, found that students altered their online behaviors (e.g., range of topics discussed and writing style) when aware of institutional surveillance. Albrechtslund (2008, para. 46) explores the notion of participatory surveillance, focusing on surveillance as “mutual, horizontal practice” as well as the social and “playful aspects” of surveillance (also see Knox, 2010b; Lyon, 2007; Varvel, Montague, &amp;amp; Estabrook, 2007). Knox (2010b) provides a very useful typology of surveillance, highlighting, inter alia, the difference between surveillance (p. 1514)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and monitoring, automation and visibility, and various aspects of rhizomatic and predictive surveillance. Rhizomatic surveillance highlights the dynamic, multidirectional flow of the act of surveillance in a synopticon, where the many can watch the few. The synopticon and Panopticon function concurrently and interact (Knox, 2010b). (p. 1515)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections discuss a range of ethical issues grouped within three broad, overlapping categories: 1. The location and interpretation of data 2. Informed consent, privacy, and the deidentification of data 3. The management, classification, and storage of data (p. 1515)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Location and Interpretation of Data (p. 1515)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“significant amounts of learner activity take place externally [to the institution] &amp;hellip; records are distributed across a variety of different sites with different standards, owners and levels of access” (Ferguson, 2012, para. 6). (p. 1515)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only do we not have all the data, a lot of the data that we do have require “extensive filtering to transform the ‘data exhaust’ in the LMS log file into educationally relevant information” (Whitmer et al., 2012, para. 22). (p. 1515)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are implications, too, of ineffective and misdirected interventions resulting from faulty learning diagnoses that might result in “inefficiency, resentment, and demotivation” (Kruse &amp;amp; Pongsajapan, 2012, p. 3). (p. 1515)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the wide range of information that may be included in such models, there is a recognized danger of potential bias and oversimplification (Bienkowski et al., 2012; Campbell et al., 2007; May, 2011). In accepting the inevitability of this, should we also question the rights of the student to remain an individual and whether it is appropriate for students to have an awareness of the labels attached to them? Are there some labels that should be prohibited? (p. 1516)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informed Consent, Privacy, and the Deidentification of Data (p. 1516)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;el and Royakkers (2004) discuss the ethics of tracking and analyzing student data without their explicit knowledge. Of interest, Land and Bayne (2005) discuss the broad acceptance of student surveillance and cite studies in which they record that the concept of logging educational activities seems to be quite acceptable to students. The notion of online privacy as a social norm is increasingly questioned (Arrington, 2010; Coll, Glassey, &amp;amp; Balleys, 2011). (p. 1516)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petersen (2012) points to the importance of the deidentification of data before the data are made available for institutional use, including the option to “retain unique identifiers for individuals in the data set, without identifying the actual identity of the individuals” (p. 48). (p. 1516)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Classification and Management of Data (p. 1516)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petersen (2012) proposes a holistic approach to transparent data management, including a need for a “comprehensive data-governance structure to address all the types of (p. 1516)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;data used in various situations,” addressing the need to create “a data-classification system that sorts data into categories that identify the necessary level of protection” (pp. 46-47). (p. 1517)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to the importance of trust in monitoring and surveillance (e.g., Adams &amp;amp; Van Manen, 2006; Knox, 2010a; Livingstone, 2005), we agree that the classification of data, as proposed by Petersen (2012), is an essential element in ensuring that appropriate access to different types of data will be regulated. (p. 1517)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integral to contemplating the ethical challenges in learning analytics is a consideration of the impact of the tools used. (p. 1517)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as highlighted by Pariser (2011), that pattern recognition can result in keeping individuals prisoner to past choices. Pariser suggests that the use of personalized filters hints of “autopropaganda, indoctrinating us with our own ideas, amplifying our desire for things that are familiar,” and that “knowing what kinds of appeals specific people respond to gives you the power to manipulate them on an individual basis” (p. 121). (p. 1517)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of student identity necessitates that we take reasonable care to allow students to act outside of imposed algorithms and models. (p. 1517)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student Identity as Transient Construct (p. 1517)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is crucial that the analysis of data in learning analytics keeps in mind the temporality of harvested data and the fact that harvested data allow us only a view of a person at a particular time and place. (p. 1517)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions should also recognize the plurality of student identity. Sen (2006) suggests that we should recognize identities as “robustly plural, and that the importance of one identity need not obliterate the importance of others” (p. 19). Students, as agents, make choices—“explicitly or by implication—about what relative importance to attach, in a particular context, to the divergent loyalties and priorities that may compete for precedence” (p. 19; also see Brah, 1996). (p. 1517)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward an Ethical Framework (p. 1518)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review left us with this question: How do we address both the potential of learning analytics to serve learning and the associated ethical challenges? (p. 1518)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petersen (2012, p. 48) proposes adherence to the principles found in the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Fair Information Practice Principles, which cover the elements of informed consent, allowing different options regarding the use of data, individuals’ right to check the accuracy and completeness of information, preventing unauthorized access, use, and disclosure of data, and provisions for enforcement and redress. Buchanan (2011) proposes three ethical principles, namely “respect for persons, beneficence, and justice” (p. 84). Not only should individuals be regarded as autonomous agents, but vulnerable individuals with diminished or constrained autonomy (including students) should be protected from harm and risk. (p. 1518)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principles for an Ethical Framework for Learning Analytics (p. 1518)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach holds that an institution’s use of learning analytics is going to be based on its understanding of the scope, role, and boundaries of learning analytics and a set of moral beliefs founded on the respective regulatory and legal, cultural, geopolitical, and socioeconomic contexts. (p. 1518)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it would be almost impossible to develop a set of universally valid guidelines that could be equally applicable within any context. However, it should be possible to develop a set of general principles from which institutions can develop their own sets of guidelines depending on their contexts. (p. 1519)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principle 1: Learning Analytics as Moral Practice (p. 1519)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learning analytics should do much more than contribute to a “datadriven university” or lead to a world where we are “living under the sword of data.” We agree with Biesta (2007) that evidence-based education seems to favor a technocratic model in which it is assumed that the only relevant research questions are about the effectiveness of educational means and techniques, forgetting, among other things, that what counts as “effective” crucially depends on judgments about what is educationally desirable. (p. 5) (p. 1519)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education cannot and should not be understood as “as an intervention or treatment because of the noncausal and normative nature of educational practice and because of the fact that the means and ends in education are internally related” (Biesta, 2007, p. 20). Learning analytics should not only focus on what is effective, but also aim to provide relevant pointers to decide what is appropriate and morally necessary. Education is primarily a moral practice, not a causal one. Therefore, learning analytics should function primarily as a moral practice resulting in understanding rather than measuring (Reeves, 2011). (p. 1519)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principle 2: Students as Agents (p. 1519)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to seeing students as producers and sources of data, learning analytics should engage students as collaborators and not as mere recipients of interventions and services (Buchanan, 2011; Kruse &amp;amp; Pongsajapan, 2012). (p. 1519)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they should also voluntarily collaborate in providing data and access to data to allow learning analytics to serve their learning and development, and not just the efficiency of institutional profiling and interventions (also see Subotzky &amp;amp; Prinsloo, 2011). Kruse and Pongsajapan (2012) propose a “student-centric,” as opposed to an “intervention-centric,” approach to learning analytics. This suggests the student should be seen as a co-interpreter of his own data—and perhaps even as a participant in the identification and gathering of that data. In this scenario, the student becomes aware of his own actions in the system and uses that data to reflect on and potentially alter his behavior. (pp. 4-5) (p. 1519)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valuing students as agents, making choices and collaborating with the institution in constructing their identities (however transient), can furthermore be a useful (and powerful) antidote to the commercialization of higher education (see, e.g., Giroux, 2003) in the context of the impact of skewed power relations, monitoring, and surveillance (Albrechtslund, 2008; Knox, 2010a, 2010b). (p. 1520)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principle 3: Student Identity and Performance Are Temporal Dynamic Constructs (p. 1520)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to see student identity as a combination of permanent and dynamic attributes. (p. 1520)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayer-Schönberger (2009, p. 12) warns that forgetting is a “fundamental human capacity.” Students should be allowed to evolve and adjust and learn from past experiences without those experiences, because of their digital nature, becoming permanent blemishes on their development history. Student profiles should not become “etched like a tattoo into &amp;hellip; [their] digital skins” (Mayer-Schönberger, 2009, p. 14). (p. 1520)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principle 4: Student Success Is a Complex and Multidimensional Phenomenon (p. 1520)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is important to see student success is the result of “mostly non-linear, multidimensional, interdependent interactions at different phases in the nexus between student, institution and broader societal factors” (Prinsloo, 2012). Although learning analytics offer huge opportunities to gain a more comprehensive understanding of student learning, our data are incomplete (e.g., Booth, 2012; Mayer-Schönberger, 2009; Richardson, 2012a, 2012b) and “dirty” (Whitmer et al., 2012) and our analyses vulnerable to misinterpretation and bias (Bienkowski et al., 2012; Campbell et al., 2007; May, 2011). (p. 1520)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principle 5: Transparency (p. 1520)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important for learning analytics as moral practice is that higher education institutions should be transparent regarding the purposes for which data will be used and under which conditions, who will have access to data, and the measures through which individuals’ identity will be protected. (p. 1520)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principle 6: Higher Education Cannot Afford to Not Use Data (p. 1521)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sixth principle makes it clear that higher education institutions cannot afford to not use learning analytics. (p. 1521)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring information that might actively help to pursue an institution’s goals seems shortsighted to the extreme. Institutions are accountable, whether it is to shareholders, to governments, or to students themselves. Learning analytics allows higher education institutions to assist all stakeholders to penetrate “the fog that has settled over much of higher education” (Long &amp;amp; Siemens, 2011, p. 40). (p. 1521)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considerations for Learning Analytics as Moral Practice (p. 1521)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we propose a number of considerations rather than a code of practice to allow for flexibility and the range of contexts in which they might need to be applied. (p. 1521)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who Benefits and Under What Conditions? (p. 1521)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is the basis for considering the ethical dimensions of learning analytics. (p. 1521)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are not simply recipients of services or customers paying for an education. They are and should be active agents in determining the scope and purpose of data harvested from them and under what conditions (e.g., deidentification). (p. 1521)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditions for Consent, Deidentification, and Opting Out (p. 1522)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the scope and nature of available data have changed dramatically, we should revisit the notion of informed consent in the field of learning analytics. (p. 1522)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many examples in different fields (e.g., bioethics) where the principle of informed consent can be waived under predetermined circumstances or if existing legislation is sufficient (e.g., data protection legislation). In extreme cases, informed consent may be forgone if the benefit to the many exceeds the needs of the individual. (p. 1522)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of learning analytics, we might suggest that there are few, if any, reasons not to provide students with information regarding the uses to which their data might be put, as well as the models used (as far as they may be known at that time), and to establish a system of informed consent. (p. 1522)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this consent may need to be refreshed on a regular basis. (p. 1522)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She suggests the need to achieve a reasonable balance between allowing quality research to be conducted and protecting users from potential harm. (p. 1522)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buchanan (2011), referring to the work of Lawson (2004), suggests a nuanced approach to consent that offers students a range of options for withholding (partial) identification of individuals where they are part of a published study. In light of this, it seems reasonable to distinguish between analyzing and using anonymized data for reporting purposes to regulatory bodies or funding purposes and other work on specific aspects of student engagement. In the context of reporting purposes, we support the notion that the benefit for the majority supersedes the right of the individual to withhold permission for use of his or her data. Students may, however, choose to opt out of institutional initiatives to personalize learning—on the condition that students are informed and aware of the consequences of their decision. (p. 1522)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions should also provide guarantees that student data will be permanently deidentified after a certain number of years, depending on national legislation and regulatory frameworks. (p. 1522)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability and Harm (p. 1522)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We suggest that the potential for bias and stereotyping in predictive analysis should be foregrounded in institutional attempts to categorize students’ risk profiles. Institutions should provide additional opportunities for these students either to prove the initial predictive analyses wrong or incomplete or to redeem themselves despite any initial institutional doubt regarding their potential. (p. 1523)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Collection, Analyses, Access, and Storage (p. 1523)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is generally accepted that data on the institutional LMS provide an incomplete picture of learners’ learning journeys. As learners’ digital networks increasingly include sources outside of the LMS, institutions may utilize data from outside the LMS (e.g., Twitter and Facebook accounts, whether study related or personal) to get more comprehensive pictures of students’ learning trajectories. (p. 1524)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions should commit themselves to take due care to prevent bias and stereotyping, always acknowledging the incomplete and dynamic nature of individual identity and experiences. Algorithms used in learning analytics inherently may reflect and perpetuate the biases and prejudices in cultural, geopolitical, economic, and societal realities. (p. 1524)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Care should be taken to ensure that the contexts of data analyzed are carefully considered before tentative predictions and analyses are made. (p. 1524)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with Kruse and Pongsajapan’s (2012) proposal for “studentcentric” learning analytics, we propose that students have a right to be assured that their data will be protected against unauthorized access and that their informed consent (as discussed above) is guaranteed when their data are used. (p. 1524)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions should provide guarantees and guidelines with regard to the preservation and storage of data in line with national and international regulatory and legislative frameworks. Students should be informed that their data will be encrypted. (p. 1525)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governance and Resource Allocation (p. 1525)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petersen (2012, P. 46) states, “The most important step that any campus can take is to create a comprehensive data-governance structure to address all the types of data used in various situations.” (p. 1525)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions (p. 1525)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics is primarily a moral and educational practice, serving better and more successful learning. The inherent peril and promise of having access to and analyzing “big data” (Bollier, 2010) necessitate a careful consideration of the ethical dimensions and challenges of learning analytics. The proposed principles and considerations included within this article provide an ethical framework for higher education institutions to offer context-appropriate solutions and strategies to increase the quality and effectiveness of teaching and learning. (p. 1526)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a case study from a community college utilizing learning analytics and the development of predictive models to identify at-risk students based on dozens of key variables. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent demands for increased student success efforts, most notably from the American Graduation Initiative [1], have come as colleges are facing limited funding and resources. The Associated Press [2] and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities [3] have both recently highlighted the drastic budget cuts implemented by community colleges nationwide. Colleges are, therefore, charged with the task of developing new ways to respond to student needs with personalized, timely outreach efforts while simultaneously being mindful of resource limitations. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2011 Horizon Report produced by New Media Consortium and the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative indicated that learning analytics will have a significant impact and forecasts its wide-scale adoption within the next five years [5]. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rio Salado College (Rio) is located in Tempe, Arizona and is one of the ten colleges in the Maricopa County Community College District. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online courses are delivered to students using RioLearn, a proprietary learning management system (LMS) that was built to serve over 100,000 students in partnership with Microsoft and Dell Computers. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the previous section, this research aimed to answer three primary questions. 52 Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, Volume 16: Issue 3 1. 2. 3. Which factors are effective as early or point-in-time predictors of course outcome in online learning? How can community colleges utilize those factors in predictive models to forecast student outcomes? How can community colleges utilize predictive models to implement proactive, effective, and sustainable student interventions with the goal of improving student success rates within the online learning population? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data used for this study was collected from a freshman-level accounting course during the summer and fall 2009 semesters (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information pertaining to online student activity and assignment grades was obtained from RioLearn. Information pertaining to enrollments, including final grades, was obtained from PeopleSoft, the districtwide student information system used by the Maricopa County Community College District. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logged in to RioLearn system Logged in to course section homepage Viewed the course syllabus Opened an assessment Completed an assessment Viewed grade book comments from instructor Viewed assessment feedback from instructor Opened a lesson Requested due date change Selected a custom calendar option (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When analyzing LMS activity at multiple points in time throughout the duration of a course, we propose that recent behavior should be viewed with more significance than past behavior. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with this philosophy, we calculated the frequency of student activities as weighted sums based on when each activity occurred relative to the course start and end dates. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Naïve Bayes classification model (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the naïve Bayes classification model was chosen because it offered significant advantages in several key areas compared to other methods. For instance, the naïve Bayes algorithm is computationally inexpensive, which is an important parameter due to the large student population at Rio Salado College. Also, Naïve Bayes is very scalable, meaning that the addition of more students or input variables will not cause a dramatic reduction in performance. Finally, as mentioned previously, naïve Bayes has demonstrated a strong record of accuracy in a variety of domains over many years of academic research [15, 16]. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple three-level warning indicator was used to provide a user-friendly abstraction of the estimated probability of course success—meaning a grade of “C” or better. The warning levels were labeled as Low, Moderate, and High. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students with an estimated probability of success below 30% were determined to have a High warning level. Students above 70% had a Low warning level and students between 30% and 70% had a Moderate warning level. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. Investigation of Factors (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weak correlations&lt;br /&gt;
 these correlations are all pretty low, &amp;lt; .3. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D. Predictive Models (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, the highest success rate was found in the Low warning group and the lowest success rate was found in the High warning group. The mean success rate was approximately 70% in the Low warning group, 54% in the Moderate warning group, and 34% in the High warning group. Therefore, the models were successful in accurately assessing the likelihood of successful course completion. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accuracy questionable&lt;br /&gt;
 Worse than a guess for high warning group? Why? (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RioPACE, an acronym for Progress And Course Engagement. RioPACE was designed to determine appropriate warning levels on a weekly basis using updated activity and grade information. It was also intended to provide additional, more specific information to show student performance in the areas of log-in activity, site engagement, and pace. The system was again designed to run within the RioLearn LMS. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D. Interventions (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated the strong correlation that exists between LMS activity markers and course outcome, which has also recently been noted by other researchers [12]. We have shown that log-in frequency, site engagement, pace, assignment grades, and some non-LMS enrollment factors can serve as effective predictors of course outcome, even as early as the eighth day of class. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interventions were not successful, probably caused by the weakness of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we give a tutorial introduction to what we call here stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics, which are a type of models that have the purpose to represent net- work dynamics on the basis of observed longitudinal data, and evaluate these according to the paradigm of statistical inference. This means that the models should be able to represent network dynamics as being driven by many different tendencies, such as the micro-mechanisms alluded to above, which could have been theo- retically derived and/or empirically established in earlier research, and which may well operate simultaneously. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social networks are dynamic by nature. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of such tendencies are reciprocity, transitivity, homophily, and assor- tativematching,aswillbeelaboratedbelow.Inthisway,themodels shouldbeabletogiveagoodrepresentationofthestochasticdepen- dence between the creation, and possibly termination, of different network ties. These stochastic actor-based models allow to test hypotheses about these tendencies, and to estimate parameters expressing their strengths, while controlling for other tendencies (which in statistical terminology might be called ‘confounders’). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;butlackanexplicitesti- mation theory. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model assumptions (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A foundational assumption of the models discussed in this paper is that the network ties are not brief events, but can be regarded as states with a tendency to endure over time. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since such models do not allow to control for other influences on the network dynamics, and how to estimate and test parameters is not clear for them, they cannot be used for purposes of theory testing in a statistical model. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the network ties under study denote states, it is fur- ther assumed, as an approximation, that the changing network can be interpreted as the outcome of a Markov process, i.e., that for any point in time, the current state of the network determines proba- bilistically its further evolution, and there are no additional effects of the earlier past. All relevant information is therefore assumed to be included in the current state. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are not based on an explicit stochastic model for the network dynamics and therefore do not allow to control one tendency for other (‘confounding’) tendencies. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing characteristics of stochastic actor-based models are flexibility, allowing to incorporate a wide variety of actor-driven micro-mechanisms influencing tie formation (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;micro-mechanism is a key idea here. Does the current literature connect it to self-oraganization? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper gives a non-technical introduction into actor-based models for network dynamics. More precise explanations can be found in Snijders (2001, 2005) and (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assume here that the empirical data consist of two, but preferably more, repeated observations of a social net- work on a given set of actors; one could call this network panel data. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our examples social actors are individuals, but they could also be firms, countries, etc. The ties are supposed to be, in principle, under control of the sending actor (although this will be subject to constraints), which will exclude most types of relations where negotiations are required for a tie to come into existence. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;important assumptions discussed here (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1. Basic assumptions (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model is about directed relations, where each tie i → j has a sender i, who will be referred to as ego, and a receiver j, referred to as alter. The following assumptions are made. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heart of the model is the so-called objective function, which deter- mines probabilistically the tie changes made by the actors. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The underlying time parameter t is continuous, i.e., the process unfoldsintimestepsofvaryinglength,whichcouldbearbitrarily small. The parameter estimation procedure, however, assumes that the network is observed only at two or more discrete points in time. The observations can also be referred to as ‘network panelwaves’,analogoustopanelsurveysinnon-networkstudies. (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the poten- tial components of this function are structure-based (endogenous effects), such as the tendency to form reciprocal relations, others are attribute-based (exogenous effects), such as the preference for similar others. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuous-time assumption allows to represent dependencies between network tiesastheresultofprocesseswhereonetieisformedasareaction (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to the existence of other ties. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changing network is the outcome of a Markov process. This was explained above. Thus, the total network structure is the social context that influences the probabilities of its own change. (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actor-based network change process is decomposed into two sub-processes, both of which are stochastic. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption of a Markov process has been made in practi- callyallmodelsforsocialnetworkdynamics,startingby Katzand Proctor’s (1959) discrete Markov chain model. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The change opportunity process, modeling the frequency of tie changes by actors. The change rates may depend on the network positions of the actors (e.g., centrality) and on actor covariates (e.g., age and sex). (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could say that this assumption is a lens through which we look at the data—it should help but it also may distort. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The change determination process, modeling the precise tie changes made when an actor has the opportunity to make a change. The probabilities of tie changes may depend on the net- work positions, as well as covariates, of ego and the other actors (‘alters’) in the network. This is explained below. (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actor-based model can be regarded as an agent-based sim- ulation model (Macy and Willer, 2002). It does not deviate in principle from other agent-based models, only in ways deriving from the fact that the model is to be used for statistical infer- ence,whichleadstorequirementsofflexibility(enoughparameters that can be estimated from the data to achieve a good fit between model and data) and parsimony (not more fine detail in the model than what can be estimated from the data). The word ‘actor’ rather than ‘agent’ is used, in line with other sociological literature (e.g., Hedström, 2005), to underline that actors are not regarded as sub- servient to others’ interests in any way. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting.. distinctions between agent and actor. also good to know these two clusters share similar traits/interests. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actors control their outgoing ties. This means not that actors can change their outgoing ties at will, but that changes in ties are made by the actors who send the tie, on the basis of their and others’ attributes, their position in the network, and their perceptions about the rest of the network. This assumption is the reason for using the term ‘actor-based model’. T (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he methodological approach of structural individualism (Udehn, 2002; Hedström, 2005), where actors are assumed to be purposeful and to behave subject to structural constraints. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is assumed formally that actors have full infor- mation about the network and the other actors. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This procedure uses the basic principle that the first observed net- work is itself not modeled but used only as the starting point of the simulations. In statistical terminology: the estimation procedure conditions on the first observation. This implies that it is the change between two observed periods time points that is being modeled, and the analysis does not have the aim to make inferences about the determinants of the network structure at the first time point. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a given moment one probabilistically selected actor – ‘ego’ – may get the opportunity to change one outgoing tie. No more than one tie can change at any moment— (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;principledecom- poses the change process into its smallest possible components, thereby allowing for relatively simple modelling. This implies that tie changes are not coordinated, and depend on each other only sequentially, via the changing configuration of the whole network. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Change determination model (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in the model is the choice of the focal actor (ego) who gets the opportunity to make a change. This choice can be made with equal probabilities or with probabilities depending on attributes or network position (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This selected focal actor then may change one outgoing tie (i.e., either initiate or withdraw a tie), or do nothing (i.e., keep the present sta- tus quo). This means that the set of admissible actions contains n elements: n − 1 changes and one non-change. The probabilities for a choice depend on the so-called objective function. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assumption excludes relational dynamics where some kind of coordination or negotiation is essential for the cre- ation of a tie (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the model selection, an essential part is the theory-guided choice of effects included in the objective function in order to test the formulated hypotheses. A good approach may be to progres- sively build up the model according to the method of decreasing abstraction (Lindenberg, 1992). An additional consideration here is, however, that the complexity of network processes, and the lim- itations of our current knowledge concerning network dynamics, imply that model construction may require data-driven elements to select the most appropriate precise specification of the endoge- nousnetworkeffects. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the proba- bilities of changes are assumed to depend on the personal networks thatwouldresultfromthechangesthatpossiblycouldbemade,and their composition in terms of covariates, via the objective function values of those networks. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise interpretation is given by Eq. (4) in Appendix A. This is the core of model and it must represent the research questions and relevant theoretical and field-related knowledge. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name ‘objective function’ was chosen because one possible interpretation is that it represents the short-term objectives (net result of preferences and structural as well as cognitive constraints) of the actor. Which action to choose out of the set of admissible actions, given that ego has the opportunity to act (i.e., change a networktie),followsthelogicofdiscretechoicemodels (McFadden, 1973; Maddala, 1983) which have been developed for modeling sit- uations where the dependent variable is a choice made from a finite set of actions. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i am thinking a lot about a student&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;objectives&amp;rsquo; when choosing to read, write, and respond to something in KF. The fundamental theoretical alignment is there but needs to be carefully unpacked. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effects depending only on the network are called structural or endogenous effects, while effects depending only on externally given attributes are called covariate or exogenous effects. The complexity of networks is such that an exhaustive list cannot meaningfully be given. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Specification of the objective function (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective function determines the probabilities of change in the network, given that an actor has the opportunity to make a change. One could say it represents the ‘rules for network behavior’ of the actor. This function is defined on the set of possible states of the network, as perceived from the point of view of the focal actor, where ‘state of the network’ refers not only to the ties but also to the covariates. When the actor has the possibility of moving to one out of a set of network states, the probability of any given move is higher accordingly as the objective function for that state is higher. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3.1. Basic effects (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most basic effect is defined by the outdegree of actor i, and this will be included in all models. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in generalized linear statistical models, the objective func- tion is assumed to be a linear combination of a set of components called effects, (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another quite basic effect is the tendency toward reciprocity, represented by the number of reciprocated ties of actor i. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the functions s ki(x) are the effects, functions of the network thatarechosenbasedontheoryandsubject-matterknowledge,and correspond to the ‘tendencies’ mentioned in the introductory sec- tion (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the weights ˇ k are the statistical parameters. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3.2. Transitivity and other triadic effects (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to reciprocity, an essential feature in most social networks isthetendencytowardtransitivity,ortransitiveclosure(sometimes called clustering): friends of friends become friends, or in graph- theoretic terminology: two-paths tend to be, or to become, closed (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transitive triplets effect measures transitivity for an actor i by counting the number of pairs j, h such that there is the transitive (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outdegree-related activity effect again is a self-reinforcing effect: when it has a positive parameter, the dispersion of outdegrees will tend to increase over time, or to be sustained if it already is high. The indegree-related activity effect has the same consequence as the outdegree-related popularity effect: positive parameters lead to a relatively high association between indegrees and outdegrees. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four degree-related effects can be regarded as the analogues in the case of directed relations of what was called cumulative advantage by Price (1976) and prefer- ential attachment by Barabási and Albert (1999) in their models for dynamics of non-directed networks: a self-reinforcing process of degree differentiation. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one is the transitive ties effect, which measures transitivity for actor i by counting the number of other actors h for which there is at least one intermediary j forming a transitive triplet of this kind. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These degree-related effects can represent hierarchy between nodes in the network, but in a different way than the triadic effects of transitivity and 3-cycles. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect hierarchy, ties go from the bottom to the top, so that the bottom nodes have high outdegrees and low indegrees and the top nodes have low outdegrees and high indegrees. This will be reflected by positive indegree popularity and negative outdegree popularity, and by positive outdegree activity and negative inde- gree activity. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effect closely related to transitivity is balance (cf. Newcomb, 1962), which in our implementation is the same as s tructural equivalence with respect to out-ties (cf. Burt, 1982), which is the tendency to have and create ties to other actors who make the same choices as ego. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other degree-related effects are assortativity-related: actors might have preferences for other actors based on their own and the other’s degrees (Morris and Kretzschmar, 1995; Newman, 2002).In (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different triadic effect is the number of three-cycles that actor i is involved in (Fig. 1b). Davis (1970) found that in many social network data sets, there is a tendency to have relatively few three- cycles, which can be represented here by a negative parameter ˇ k for the three-cycle effect. The transitive triplets and the three-cycle effects both represent closed structures, but whereas the former is in line with a hierarchical ordering, the latter goes against such an ordering. If the network has a strong hierarchical tendency, one expects a positive parameter for transitivity and a negative for three-cycles. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he four effects described as degree-related popularity and activity are more basic than the assortativityeffects(cf.therelationbetweenmaineffectsandinter- actions in linear regression). Because of this, when testing any assortativity effects, one usually should control for three of the degree-related popularity and activity effects. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3.3. Degree-related effects (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One pair of effects is degree-related popularity based on indegree or outdegree. If these effects are positive, nodes with higher indegree, or higher outdegree, are more attractive for others to send a tie to. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3.4. Covariates: exogenous effects (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an actor variable V, there are three basic effects: the ego effect, measuring whether actors with higher Vvalues tend to nom- inate more friends and hence have a higher outdegree (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A positive indegree-related popularity effect implies that high indegrees reinforce themselves, which will lead to a relatively high dispersion of the indegrees (a Matthew effect in popularity as measured by indegrees, cf. Merton, 1968; Price, 1976). A positive outdegree-related popularity effect will increase the association between indegrees and outdegrees, or keep this association relatively high if it is high already. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the alter effect, measuring whether actors with higher V values will tend to be nominated by more others and hence have higher indegrees (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the similarity effect, measuring whether ties tend to occur more often between actors with similar values on V (homophily effect). Tendencies to homophily constitute a fundamental characteristic (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another pair of effects is degree-related activity for i ndegree or outdegree: when these effects are positive, nodes with higher inde- gree,orhigheroutdegreerespectively,willhaveanextrapropensity to form ties to others. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of information depends on the number of actors, the number of observation moments (‘panel waves’), and the total number of changes between consecutive observations. The num- ber of observation moments should be at least 2, and is usually much less than 10. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of the similarity effect one could use the ego–alter interaction effect (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no objections in principle against ana- lyzing a larger number of time points, but then one should check the assumption that the parameters in the objective function are constant over time, or that the trends in these parameters are well represented by their interactions with time variables (see point 10 below). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3.5. Interactions (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in other statistical models, interactions can be important to express theoretically interesting hypotheses. The diversity of func- tions that could be used as effects makes it difficult to give general expressions for interactions. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AnotherexampleisgivenbydeFederico(2004) asaninteraction of a covariate with reciprocity. In her analysis of a friendship net- work between exchange students, she found a negative interaction between reciprocity and having the same nationality. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of actors will usually be larger than 20—but if the data contain many waves, a smaller number of actors could be acceptable. The number of actors will usually not be more than a few hundred, because the implicit assumption that each actor is a potential network partner for any other actor might be implausible for networks with so many actors that not all actors are aware of each others’ existence. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total number of changes between consecutive observa- tions should be large enough, because these changes provide the information for estimating the parameters. A total of 40 changes (cumulatedoverallsuccessivepanelwaves)isonthelowside.More changes will give more information and, thereby, allow more com- plicatedmodelstobefitted.Betweenanypairofconsecutivewaves, the number of changes should not be too high, because this would call into question the assumption that the waves are consecutive observations of a gradually changing network; or, if they were, the consecutive observations would be too far apart. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implies that, when designing the study, the researcher has to have a reasonable estimate of how much change to expect. For instance, if one is interested in the development of the friendship network of a group of initially mutual strangers (e.g., university freshmen), it may be good to plan the observation moments to be separated by only a few weeks (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a further class of examples, note that in the actor-based framework it may be natural to hypothesize that the strength of certain effects depends on attributes of the focal actor. For exam- ple, girls might have a greater tendency toward transitive closure than boys. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting. gender could also be considered in CSCL data. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To express quantitatively whether the data collection points are not too far apart, one may use the Jaccard (1900) index (also see Batagelj and Bren, 1995), applied to tie variables. This measures the amount of change between two waves by (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues arising in statistical modeling (p. 6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When employing these models, important practical issues are the question how to specify the model – boiling down mainly to the choice of the terms in the objective function – and how to interpret the results. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience has shown that Jaccard values between consecutive waves should preferably be higher than 0.3, and – unless the first wave has a much lower density than the second – values less than 0.2 would lead to doubts about the assumption that the change process is gradual, compared to the observation frequency. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;important to note (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. Data requirements (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the data should contain enough informa- tion. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one may look instead at the proportion, among the ties present at a given observation, of ties that have remained in existence at the next observation (N 11/ (N 10 + N 11) in the preceding notation). Proportions higher (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;than 0.6 are preferable, between 0.3 and 0.6 would be low but may still be acceptable. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network statistics can be highly correlated just because of their definition. This also implies that parameter estimates can be rather strongly correlated, and high parameter correlations do not necessarily imply that some of the effects should be dropped. (p. 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methods require in principle that network data are com- plete. However, it is allowed that some of the actors enter the network after the start, or leave before the end of the panel waves (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another optiontorepresentthatsomeactorsarenotyet,ornomore,present in the network, is to specify that certain ties cannot exist (‘struc- tural zeros’) or that some ties are prescribed (‘structural ones’), see Snijders et al. (2008). The use of structural zeros allows, e.g., to combine several small networks into one structure (with struc- tural zeros forbidding ties between different networks), allowing to analyze multiple independent networks that on themselves would not yield enough information for estimating parameters, under the extra assumption that all network follow dynamics with the same parameter values in the objective function. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will this allow multidimensional network as well? (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. Testing and model selection (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out (supported by computer simulations) that the dis- tributions of the estimates of the parameters ˇ k in the objective function (1), representing the importance of the various terms mentioned in Section 2.3, are approximately normally distributed. Therefore these parameters can be tested by referring the t-ratio (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;estimation round. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to let the model selection be guided by theory, subject-matter knowledge, and common sense. Often, however, theory and prior knowledge are stronger with respect to effects of covariates – e.g., homophily effects – than with respect to structure. (p. 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For actor-based models for network dynamics, information- theoretic model selection criteria have not yet generally been developed, although Koskinen (2004) presents some first steps for such an approach. Currently the best possibility is to use ad hoc stepwise procedures, combining forward steps (where effects are added to the model) with backward steps (where effects are deleted). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among the structural effects, the outdegree and reciprocity effect should be included by default. In almost all longitudinal social network data sets, there also is an important tendency toward transitivity (Davis, 1970). This should be modeled by one, or several, of the transitivity-related effects described above. (p. 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We prefer not to give a recipe, but rather a list of considerations that a researcher might have in mind when constructing a strategy for model selection. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, there are some covariate effects which are predicted by theory; these may be control effects or effects occurring in hypotheses. It is good practice to include control effects from the start. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitting complicated models may be time-consuming and lead to instabilityofthealgorithm,andaresultingfailuretoobtaingood estimates.Therefore,forwardselectionistechnicallyeasierthan backward selection, which is unfortunately at variance with the preceding remark. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The degree-based effects (popularity, activity, assortativity) can be important structural alternatives for actor covariate effects, and can be important network-level alternatives for the triad- level effects. It is advisable, at some moment during the model selection process, to check these effects; note that the square- root specification usually works best. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimation algorithm (Snijders, 2001) is iterative, and the initial value can determine whether or not the algorithm con- verges. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For complicated models, however, the algorithm may converge more easily if started from an initial value obtained as the estimate for a somewhat simpler model. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the data have three or more waves and the model does not include time-changing variables, then the assumption is made that the time dynamics is homogeneous, which will lead to smooth trajectories of the main statistics from wave to wave. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model assumes that the ‘rules for network change’ are the same for all actors, except for differences implied by covari- ates or network position. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As exogenous control variables, we include sender and receiver effects of sex, and a dyadic covariate indicating friendship in pri- mary school reflecting relationship history. In addition, several degree-related endogenous effects are included as control effects: in- and outdegree-related popularity, and outdegree-related activ- ity, explained above. Estimates for this model are given in Table 1 as Model0.AllcalculationsweredoneusingSienaversion3.2 (Snijders et al., 2008). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis confirms, for this data set, several of the known properties of friendship networks: there is a high degree of reci- procity, as seen in the significant reciprocity parameter; there is segregation according to the sexes, as seen in the significant same sex parameter; there is an almost equally strong effect of hav- ing been friends at primary school already, and there is evidence for transitive closure, as seen in the significant effects of transi- tive triplets and transitive ties. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3. Example: friendship dynamics (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of example, we analyze the evolution of a friendship network in a Dutch school class. The data were collected between September 2003 and June 2004 as part of a study reported in Knecht (2008). The 26 students (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other significant effectsarethenegative 3-cyclesparameter,whichindicatesthatthe tendencies toward closure are not completely egalitarian (as one might have thought based on the reciprocity parameter), but do show some evidence for local hierarchization in the network. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the marginally significant negative effect of the outdegree-relatedpopularitywhichindicatesthatactivepupils,i.e., those who nominate particularly many friends, are less likely to be chosen as friends – this could be a status effect negatively associ- ated with nomination activity. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaccard coefficients for similarity of ties between waves are between 0.4 and 0.5, which is somewhat low (reflecting fairly high turnover) but not too low. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also significant is the sender effect of sex (sex (M) ego), which in our coding of the variable means that theboystendtobemoreactiveintheclassroomfriendshipnetwork than the girls. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some data were missing due to absence of pupils at the moment of data collection. This was treated by ad-hoc model-based imputa- tion using the procedure explained in Huisman and Steglich (2008). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent model (Model 1 in Table 1), more parsimony is obtained by eliminating the non-significant effects in a backward selection procedure. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering point 1 above, effects known to play a role in friendship dynamics, such as basic structural effects and effects of basic covariates, are included in the baseline model. From earlier research, it is known that friendship formation tends to be recip- rocal, shows tendencies towards network closure, and in this age group is strongly segregated according to the sexes. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.4. Parameter interpretation (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameters in the objective function can be interpreted in two ways. In the first place, by interpreting this function as the “attractiveness” of the network for a given actor. For getting a feel- ing of what are small and large values, it may be noted (see the interpretation in terms of myopic optimization in Snijders, 2001) that the objective functions are used to compare how attractive various different tie changes are, and for this purpose random dis- turbances are added to the values of the objective function with standard deviations equal2 to 1.28. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thistableshowsthatgirlsaswellasboyspreferfriendshipswith same-sex alters, but for boys the difference is more pronounced than for girls. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More complicated models (p. 9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1. Differential rates of change: the rate function (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average frequency at which actors get the opportunity to change their outgoing ties then is called the rate function, depending on attributes and network position of the actors. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model 2 in Table 1 gives an example of such an analysis. It extends Model 1 by adding an effect of sex on the rate function. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To interpret the parameter values, one should know that a so- called exponential link function is used (Snijders, 2001; Snijders et al., 2008), which means that the variables have an effect on the rate function after an exponential transformation, with a multiplicative effect. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2. Differences between creating and terminating ties: the endowment function (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be modeled by having two components of the objective function: the evaluation function, which considers only the network that will be the case as a result of the change to be made; and the endowment function, which is a component that operates only for the termina- tion of ties and not for their creation. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model 3 in Table 1 gives the results of an analysis that includes, in addition to the effects of Model 1, also an endowment effect related to reciprocity. It was estimated as significant and positive, while the corresponding evaluation function effect of reciprocity droppedinsizeandsignificance.Tointerpretthisresult,jointlycon- sider the reciprocity evaluation effect with parameter 0.71 and the reciprocity endowment effect with parameter 1.42. The contribu- tion of a tie being reciprocated then is 0.71 for the creation of the tie and 0. 71 + 1. 42 = 2. 13 against the termination of the tie. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamics of networks and behavior (p. 11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I plan to revisit this section later when getting more familiar with SIENA.&lt;/em&gt; (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social networks are so important also because they are rele- vant for behavior and other actor-level outcomes: related actors may influence one another (e.g., Friedkin, 1998), and ties will be selected in part based on the similarity between ego and potential relational partners (homophily, see McPherson et al., 2001). This means that not only is the network changing as a function of itself andoftheactorvariables,butlikewisetheactorvariablesarechang- ing as a function of themselves and of the network. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes in behavior depend on an objective function similar to the objective function for network changes. However, this func- tion will be different because it needs to represent primarily the actor’s behavior rather than his/her network position, and because choicesofbehaviorchangesmaybeframeddifferentlyfromchoices of tie changes, depending on different goals and restrictions. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the term behavior as shorthand for endogenously changing actor vari- ables, although these could also refer to attitudes, performance, etc.; there could be one or more of such variables. It is assumed here that the behavior variables are ordinal discrete variables, with values 1, 2, etc., up to some maximum value, for instance, several levels of delinquency, several levels of smoking, etc. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The depen- dence of the network dynamics on the total network-behavior configuration will be also called the social selection process, while the dependence of the behavior dynamics on the total network- behavior configuration will be called the social influence process. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;terms: social selection, social influence. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This combination of selection and influence can be modeled by an extension of the actor-based model to a structure where the dependent variables consist not only of the tie variables but also of the actors’ behavior variables (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumptions for the actor-based model for the dynamics of networks and behavior are extensions of the assumptions for network dynamics. The extended formulations are as follows (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal actor-based model is more general than the ERGM in that it does not require that the observed process be in equilibrium. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-sectional and longitudinal modeling (p. 14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equilibrium is understood here not as a fixed state but as dynamic equilibrium, where changes continue but may be regarded as stochastic fluctuations without a systematic trend. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion (p. 14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cross-sectional modeling the exponential random graph model (‘ERGM’), or p∗ model, is similar to the model of this paper in its statistical approach to network structure (cf. Wasserman and Pattison, 1996; Robins et al., 2007, and the references cited there). A telling characteristic of the ERGM is that the only feasible way to obtain random draws from such a probability distribution is to simulate a process longitudinally until it may be assumed to have reached dynamic equilibrium, and then take samples from the pro- cess (Snijders, 2002). Thus, the ERGM can be best understood as a model of a process in equilibrium. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of these models is to be used to test hypotheses con- cerning network dynamics and represent the strength of various tendencies driving the dynamics by estimated parameters. To be useful in this way for statistical inference, the models must be able togiveagoodrepresentationofthedependenciesbetweennetwork ties, and between network positions and behavior of the actors. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These goals are accomplished by the stochastic actor-driven model in which the central object of modeling is the objective function (1), (3), analogous to the linear predictor in generalized linear modeling (e.g. Long, 1997). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further applications of these models are presented in some of the papers in this special issue. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;check out the special issue (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These models are relatively new, and more complicated than many other statistical models to which social scientists are used. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @Snyder2011-ss&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snyder, P. (2011). Implementing Randomized Controlled Trials in Preschool Settings That Include Young Children With Disabilities: Considering the Context of Strain and Bovey. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 31(3), 162–165.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commentary on @Strain2011-sn, highlighting its contribution to finding the &amp;ldquo;best-available&amp;rdquo; evidence by running a randomized controlled trial. History of IES&amp;rsquo; emphasis on RCT is also explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent of this federal support is to increase the number of scientifically valid efficacy or effec- tiveness evaluations conducted on “early” interventions with the goal of identifying “what works.” It is expected that these studies will help inform and advance practices in the field and contribute to activities related to evidence-based practice, particularly activities focused on identification of the “best-available” evidence (Snyder, 2006). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several developments have shaped not only how this RCT was designed and implemented, but also how other RCTs are being conducted to evaluate promising interven- tions for young children with disabilities or the practitio- ners who support them. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this commentary is to describe these developments and to identify issues likely to be encountered when conducting these studies or review- ing findings. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings from a review of 450 studies published between 1990 and 1998 that used quantitative group designs revealed a paucity of RCTs conducted during this period (10% of the reviewed studies). In addition, data suggested that the best-available evidence was not uniformly convincing and compelling given issues related to the methodological integrity of the reviewed studies (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the seminal text Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research, Campbell and Stanley (1966) pro- vided an historical account of the enthusiasm and disillu- sionment with rigorous experimentation in education—dating back to Thorndike. Over the years, our field also has debated the value and feasibility of conducting rigorous experiments, such as RCTs, in applied field settings (e.g., Bricker, Bailey, &amp;amp; Bruder, 1984; Snyder, 2006; White &amp;amp; Pezzino, 1986). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is relatively new, however, is the availability of fed- eral support from the U.S. Department of Education to con- duct scientifically valid efficacy or effectiveness evaluations of interventions relevant for early intervention and early learning in special education. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) was established within IES as part of the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA, P.L. 108-446). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rom a best-available evidence per - spective, these designs generally produce evidence at an individual study level that is less convincing and compel- ling than experimental designs, particularly randomized controlled trials. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act specified, in Section 201, that research conducted under the auspices of NCSER should “conform to high standards of quality integrity, accuracy, validity, and reliability” and be “carried out in accordance with the stan- dards for the conduct and evaluation of all research and development established by the National Center for Education Research.” (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team acknowledged that the general lack of methodological rigor across the group quantitative studies might not reflect poor science or scien- tists but realities and resource constraints associated with conducting applied group experimental intervention research in authentic settings. In addition, at this time, emphasis was shifting from using group experimental designs to address “first-generation” questions about the effectiveness of early intervention to using these designs to address second- generation research questions (Guralnick, 1997). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;help advance understandings about “what works” (on average) for particular groups under certain (controlled) circumstances. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strain and Bovey (2011) study was among the first of the efficacy studies funded by the IES. The authors acknowl- edge that although 28 peer-reviewed component analysis stud- ies have been conducted to evaluate the Learning Experiences Alternative Program (LEAP) intervention, the “overall effi- cacy of enrollment in LEAP could not be argued without a randomized trial” (Strain &amp;amp; Bovey, 2011, p. 3). In IES par- lance, the Strain and Bovey study was a “Goal 3” study. Goal 3 studies focus on examining intervention efficacy or the rep- lication of intervention findings (IES, 2011). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major development that has influenced the wider use of RCTs to address second-generation research ques- tions was associated with the passage of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (PL 107-279), which estab- lished the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). IES was charged with supporting rigorous research relevant for edu- cation practice and policy. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;projects of explo- ration (Goal 1), development and innovation (Goal 2), scale-up (Goal 4), and measurement (Goal 5). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Act specified that scientifically valid efficacy or effectiveness evaluations of educational interventions should “employ experimental designs using random assignment, when feasible, and other research methodologies that allow for the strongest possible causal inferences when random assignment is not feasible” (Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the require - ments are consistent with recommended practices related to the implementation of rigorous experimental designs, (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;including RCTs (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, rather than compare the LEAP intervention to a “business-as-usual” condition, teachers in comparison classrooms received LEAP intervention manuals, videos, and training presentation materials. Obtained effects that favored the intervention condition occurred under circum- stances where the two levels of intervention shared compa- rable components, which often results in smaller obtained effect sizes. By carefully selecting the counterfactual condi- tion (and measuring what occurred in this condition), Strain and Bovey (2011) have information that is useful for informing post hoc interpretations of treatment effects rela- tive to the counterfactual. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the social validity of the LEAP intervention was systematically examined and evidence presented by Strain and Bovey (2011) suggest noteworthy and positive associa- tions between the implementation fidelity scores for the subgroup of teachers in the intervention cohorts at the end of coaching and their social validity ratings. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducting these evaluations in authentic pre- school settings with specific populations of teachers or chil- dren, however, presents opportunities and challenges. Strain and Bovey (2011) described how they addressed several of these opportunities and challenges. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, “typical” intervention agents were supported through training workshops, provision of materials, and on- site support to implement the LEAP intervention in authen- tic preschool settings. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strain and Bovey (2011) also encountered challenges not unfamiliar to others who conduct RCTs in authentic settings: (a) missing data, (b) participant attrition, &amp;copy; variations in treatment implementation, (d) variations in treatment effects across individual and sites, and (e) design “trade-offs” related to available resources and costs. Their acknowledg- ments of these (and other) limitations help remind us that no single study should or would be expected to offer definitive evidence of what works for whom and under what circum- stances in relation to promising interventions. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers’ implementation of LEAP practices likely resulted in shifts in children’s classroom experiences that, in turn, were associated with differential developmen- tal and learning outcomes (Wolery, 2011). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much remains to be learned about the type, quality, and dosage of implemen- tation supports that might be needed to achieve and sustain implementation fidelity, particularly for multicomponent interventions like LEAP. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;watch for these words (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, fidelity of implementation was evaluated in both experimental conditions using the Quality Program Indicators (QPI) measure. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite identified challenges, I believe we should remain optimistic about our ability to conduct suffi- cient rigorous experimental evaluations to answer important second-generation research questions. Strain and Bovey have made a noteworthy contribution to the “best-available” research evidence, particularly in relation to interventions for young children with autism spectrum disorders. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;contribute to the bigger picture of scientific knowledge and theory on learning, instruction, and education systems. (IES, 2013b, p. 11) (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Educational Research Association (AERA) formally addressed some of these issues in issuing “Standards for Reporting on Empirical Social Sciences Research in AERA Publications” in 2006, followed by issuing a second set of standards in 2009 focused on humanities-oriented research. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this special section, we have invited five scholars to offer their views on this call for “scientific knowledge” in education and how scientific knowledge is understood and perhaps misun- derstood. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phillips, a philosopher of education and social sci- ence, argues that all “competent inquiries” share basic features. He also draws our attention to the problematic nature of the term scientific and argues for a greater need for “ecological valid- ity” in our work. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also point to the importance of understanding how policy decisions shape research that is conducted in education. Assessments of what constitutes rigor- ous research shape what policymakers choose to support, what educational researchers hold as valuable, and what educational practitioners choose to implement. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“the nature of research in the two areas is far more similar than researchers in either community recognize” (p. 12). Wieman, a physicist, suggests that cutting-edge science is often “much messier, complicated, and less precise” (p. 12) than is commonly acknowl- edged—and in this way, it bears remarkable similarities to edu- cation research. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;report titled “Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development,” jointly released by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES; 2013a) and the National Science Foundation. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education has always produced new ideas, new innovations, and new approaches, but only appropriate empirical evaluation can identify those that are in fact improvements. Taken together, work across the various goals [of the call for proposals] should not only yield information about the practical benefits and the effects of specific interventions on education outcomes but also (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;describes the problematic nature of what is often termed the “experimental model of science.” He suggests that this standard risks casting other research tradi- tions as deficit. Rudolph also notes that “methods of inquiry are highly contextual, contingent, and emergent over time” and that many may “fall outside the narrow band of those recognized as experimental. This fact, however, makes them no less scientific” (p. 16). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Relevance to Practice as a Criterion of Rigor.” Drawing on their expertise from literacy education, learning sciences, and educational psy- chology, Gutiérrez and Penuel argue that if education research is to be meaningful—that is, if it is to allow us to understand sub- stantive and equitable change in education so that we can better organize conditions for learning—relevance to practice must be an explicit criterion of quality research. In their contribution to the conversation, these authors consider what this new criterion, “relevance to practice,” means for the conceptualization, design, and conduct of programs of education research. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strain, P. S., &amp;amp; Bovey, E. H. (2011). Randomized, Controlled Trial of the LEAP Model of Early Intervention for Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders. Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 31(3), 133–154.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;28 inclusive preschool classrooms were randomly assigned to receive 2 years of training and coaching to fidelity in the LEAP (Learning Experiences and Alternative Program for Preschoolers and Their Parents) preschool model, and 28 inclusive classes were assigned to receive intervention manuals only. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2 years, experimental class children were found to have made significantly greater improvement than their comparison cohorts on measures of cognitive, language, social, and problem behavior, and autism symptoms. Behavior at entry did not predict outcome nor did family socioeconomic status. The fidelity with which teachers implemented LEAP strategies did predict outcomes. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These one-to-one models of service delivery occasion the question as to whether educational resources are being used most effectively with young children with ASD. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, of the 12 comprehensive programs identified by the National Research Council (2001), only LEAP and two other pro- grams rely on naturally occurring, incidental teaching arrangements. All other models rely on one-to-one, dis- crete-trial, or other adult-driven instructional approaches. Significantly, research evaluating the effects of one-to-one versus incidental tactics shows uniformly that the latter approach is either equal to or superior to one-to-one arrange- ments when generalized child gains are considered (Elliott, Hall, &amp;amp; Soper, 1991; McGee, Krantz, &amp;amp; McClannahan, 1985; Miranda-Linne &amp;amp; Melin, 1992). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after fundamental, nonoverlapping differences between groups were evident after 2 years, a NIMH site visit panel recommended suspension of random assignment for ethical reasons. We fully concurred with this recommendation not- withstanding the obvious compromise in the study design. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethics.  (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we have considered it to be ethically and scien- tifically necessary to conduct various substudies to demon- strate the efficacy of key model components that are considered to be unique LEAP features. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall study had five primary research questions: Research Question 1: Do differential child outcomes occur across study groups after 2 years of LEAP implementation? Research Question 2: What is the relationship between implementation fidelity and child outcomes? Research Question 3: Are teacher’s characteristics correlated with child outcomes? Research Question 4: Does child performance at the beginning of intervention predict ultimate out- comes at 2 years? Research Question 5: How do teachers rate the social validity of their experience implementing LEAP? (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, in spite of these prior data, we determined that the overall efficacy of enrollment in LEAP could not be argued without a randomized trial. This RCT was funded by the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) under the “efficacy and replication” goal. To qualify for support under this com- petition, several requirements must be met, including (a) the intervention must be fully developed and to the extent pos- sible, manualized; (b) prior data must provide a convincing case about potential efficacy; and &amp;copy; the intervention must be implemented in authentic educational settings by typical intervention agents. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall LEAP Description (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEAP model has a number of unique features that contribute to its effectiveness and relatively lower costs. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although single-case designs on children with ASD have long utilized fidelity of treatment measures, such has not occurred in RCTs of com- prehensive treatments. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;occurred at the classroom level, it followed logically to randomly assign classrooms. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, using our treatment manuals without follow-along training was a logical standard for comparison purposes. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randomization in study group status along with equating preschools on dimensions of adult–child ratio (1:5), full inclusion (all ser- vices received in classrooms), and intensity of services (17 hr/ week on average) offered the best available analytic model. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participant Selection (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall Study Design (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we “overre- cruited” classrooms from school district settings that were willing and able to be LEAP replication sites (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We instituted a clustered randomized comparison design in which preschool classrooms matched on program dimen- sions such as number of program days per week (5) and length of program day (2.75–3 hr) and were assigned, via a table of random numbers, to either the full-scale LEAP replication training or to a comparison condition in which preschool staff were provided intervention manuals and related written materials only. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1. Key Input Differences Between LEAP Replication Classes and Manuals-Only Classes (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental Conditions (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preschools assigned to the comparison condition were provided LEAP’s intervention manuals, videos, and train- ing presentation materials (Power Point presentations) for (a) family skill training, (b) social skills training, and &amp;copy; design and operation of the inclusive classroom. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity of Intervention Concerns For 14 years, we have used an implementation protocol in the form of a procedural rating scale (QPI). The QPI con- sists of eight content areas (Classroom Organization and Planning, Teaching Strategies, Teaching Communication Skills, Promoting Social Interactions, Providing Positive Behavioral Guidance, IEPs and Measuring Progress/Data Collection, and Interactions With Children and Interactions With Families) with each content area having four to six unique indicators. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mullen Scales of Early Learning. This developmental scale provides an assessment of child performance in visual reception, fine motor, receptive language, expressive lan- guage, and a composite representing general intelligence. The Mullen (Mullen, 1995) has excellent internal reliabil- ity (.91) and short-term test–retest reliability (.95). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preschool Language Scale (4th ed.; PLS-4). The PLS-4 (Zimmerman, Steiner, &amp;amp; Pond, 2002) provides a compre- hensive assessment of children’s receptive and expressive communication competence. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Child Measures and Measurement Methods (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed the measurement protocol with the following considerations in mind: (a) We wanted to compare child outcomes at replication sites with our initial comparison intervention study of LEAP, (b) we wanted to address the defining characteristics of autism (i.e., language devia- tions, social isolation, overall developmental delay, and various forms of aberrant behavior), &amp;copy; we wanted to select measures that have demonstrated sensitivity to simi- lar interventions, and (d) we wanted to use measures that provide reliable and valid data. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Skills Rating System (SSRS). The teacher form of the SSRS (Gresham &amp;amp; Elliott, 1990) was used to assess changes in child participants’ social skill development and problem behavior. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social validity measure. At the end of our 2-year consul- tation process, the lead teacher in each intervention class was asked to complete a 5-point rating scale (see Appen- dix C) that was designed to assess consumers’ judgments on key dimensions of their consultation relationship with LEAP coaches. The 14 dimensions of social validity were based on Kohler and Strain’s (1992) review of practice dimensions shown to influence long-term use of evidence- based practices. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;t is also true that the data set would permit growth curve analyses; how- ever, our theory of change ran counter to this analytic method. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multivariate repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on clusters of classrooms, not individual child data. All differences between groups were significant at the .05 level and beyond. This analytic method was cho- sen because we had (a) no “missing data”, (b) the assess- ment schedule was consistent across all participants, &amp;copy; this analytic method was appropriate to the basic study design, and (d) multivariate repeated-measures analysis of variance has been used in all prior early childhood autism RCTs. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Validity Ratings (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although hierarchical linear modeling was a theo- retically plausible analytic method, power was not found (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 5. Correlation Between QPI Scores at End of Year 2 and Each Outcome Index Gain Score for Full Replication and Manuals-Only Classes (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods used to mitigate bias in the data gathering and analytic processes included (a) keeping assessors naïve to study hypotheses; (b) having a personnel “firewall” separat- ing staff who were working with sites to reach fidelity and those collecting outcome data; &amp;copy; having data collection, scoring, and storage subject to multiple reliability/accuracy checks; and (d) having outcome data processed independent of the principal investigator. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good practice to explain this (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this RCT on young children with ASD revealed the following results: (a) Fidelity of implemen- tation data showed that intervention classes reached high levels of fidelity (nearly 90% of practices in place) after 2 years of coaching, whereas comparison classes using the same manualized materials independent of coaching were implementing 38% of LEAP practices after 2 years; (b) children in intervention classes made significantly more progress than comparison children at the end of 2 years on measures of cognitive, language, autism symptoms, prob- lem behavior, and social skills; &amp;copy; differential child out- comes were not correlated with initial baseline performance, lead teachers’ level of experience or prior training, or with family socioeconomic status; (d) significant correlations were found between fidelity scores in intervention and comparison classes and all child outcomes; and (e) the pri- mary teachers in intervention classes rated their experience implementing LEAP practices very high, and they judged child behavior change to be attributable to these practices. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Table 6, teacher consumers had very favor- able ratings of their experience with the LEAP replication process. For the subgroup of teachers in the intervention cohorts, we examined the relationship between social validity ratings and fidelity scores at the end of coaching. The correlation between these measures was highly signifi- cant (r = .89). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is one of my favorite piece about MOOC research. It was also one of the earliest to look more deeply into MOOC learner activities. The questions got answered are important, and preliminary at the same time. But these many questions the authors ask are even more important to further explore. Obviously the team has a lot to offer in the coming year or so to help us better understand MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Circuits and Electronics” (6.002x), which began in March 2012, was the first MOOC developed by edX (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article describes both the first stage of this research, which examined the students’ use of resources by time spent on each, and a second stage that is producing an in-depth picture of who the 6.002x students were, how their own background and capabilities related to their achievement and persistence, and how their interactions with 6.002x’s curricular and pedagogical components contributed to their level of success in the course. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper describes an initial study of the data generated by MIT’s first MOOC, “Circuits and Electronics” (6.002x)1 by a team of multidisciplinary researchers from MIT and Harvard. These data include the IP addresses of all enrolled students; clickstream data that recorded each of the 230 million interactions the students had with the platform (Seaton, Bergner, Chuang, Mitros, &amp;amp; Pritchard, 2013); scores on homework assignments, labs, and exams; student and teaching staff posts on a discussion forum; and the results of a survey sent to the 6.002x students at the end of the course. We are trying to understand who the students were in 6.002x, how they utilized course resources, what contributed to their persistence, and what advanced or hindered their achievement. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If educational researchers studying conventional brick and mortar classrooms struggle to operationalize variables like attrition and achievement, it is doubly difficult to do so for MOOCs. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participation and performance do not follow the rules by which universities have traditionally organized the teaching enterprise: MOOCs allow free and easy registration, do not require formal withdrawals, and include a large number of students who may not have any interest in completing assignments and assessments. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Study Explores Resource Usage (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plot A highlights the weekly periodicity; peaks on weekends presumably reflect both the days when spare time is available and the deadline for homework submission. In plots B and C activity is shown in hits per user each day. The three instructional resources—textbook, video lectures, and lecture questions—display little end-of-week peaking, whereas for–credit assessments (homework and labs) show marked peaks suggesting these activities were done just ahead of the deadline. The discussion forum shows similar periodicity because it is accessed while doing the homework problems (for more on the use of the discussion forum, please see below). The drop in e-text activity after the first exam is typical of textbook use that has been observed in blended on-campus courses where the textbook was a supplementary resource (that is, not part of the sequence of activities presented to students by the interface). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time represents the principal cost function for students, and it is therefore important to study how students allocated their time throughout the course. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the most time was spent on lecture videos (see Figure 3). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anotherinterestingfeaturerevealedbythesedataisstudentstrategyinsolvingproblems. By strategy, we mean which resources were most frequently consulted by the students while doing problems, and which ones were viewed for the longest time? Student strategy differs very markedly when solving homework problems versus when solving exam problems. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second Stage of Research Examines Demographics, Achievement, and Persistence (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who were the students who enrolled in 6.002x, and what factors related to their level of success in the course?” (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;attempting to construct a detailed picture of the 6.002x students, using multiple sampling frames: all registrants, all students who clicked on the course website, students who demonstrated different levels of engagement of the course, and certificate earners. Next, we hope to be able to identify relationships between the characteristics and capabilities of the students themselves and their success. Finally, we want to understand how the curricular and pedagogical components of 6.002x contributed to the students’ ability to master the material. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity in Location and Demographics (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students came from 194 countries, virtually all in the world. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know, too, from an open-ended profile edX posted at the start of the course, 67% of registrants spoke English, and 16% , the next largest group, spoke Spanish. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey questions, which were grounded in research in large-scale studies in international education, included not only demographics such as age and gender, but asked students, for example, about their home environment and their educational and professional background. This is in line with educational research (Coleman et al., 1966; Gamoran &amp;amp; Long, 2008) that indicates these latter variables serve as important controls in predictions of educational outcomes. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;most reported they were in their 20s and 30s (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As might also be predicted, 88% of those who reported their gender were male. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not surprised to learn that over half the survey respondents reported the primary reason they enrolled in 6.002x was for the knowledge and skills they would gain. Although, interestingly, only 8.8% stated they registered for the course for “employment or job advancement opportunities.” Over a quarter of the students took the course for the “personal challenge.” (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no correlations between motivation for enrollment and success in the course. Whether students were taking 6.002x to advance their knowledge or because they wanted the challenge (we realize, of course, the two could be interrelated), it did not seem to affect their performance in the class. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same results&lt;br /&gt;
 We found the same in the MRI project (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Contributed to Student “Success”? Predictive Modeling as the Next Step in the Analysis (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage in this work is to define more precisely what we mean by “success” in a MOOC. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success as Achievement (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we argue, that “success” in 6.002x can be defined as it is labs, and a midterm and final. Thus, we argue, that “success” in 6.002x can be defined as it is in the traditional college classroom, namely, by the grades students earned. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this definition, we found no relationship between age and achievement or Using this definition, we found no relationship between age and achievement or “success” in 6.002x can “success” in 6.002x can between gender and achievement, and we found only a marginal relationship between between gender and achievement, and we found only a marginal relationship between be defined as it is in the be defined as it is in the highest degree earned and achievement. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strongest correlation we found between what we are calling “student background” The strongest correlation we found between what we are calling “student background” and achievement was in whether or not the survey respondent “worked offline with anyone and achievement was in whether or not the survey respondent “worked offline with anyone on the MITx material.” (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, with area,” as 2.5% did, that interaction seemed to have had a beneficial effect. On average, with all other predictors being equal, a student who worked offline with someone else in the class all other predictors being equal, a student who worked offline with someone else in the class or someone who had expertise in the subject would have a predicted score almost three or someone who had expertise in the subject would have a predicted score almost three points higher than someone working by him or herself. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of these analyses, we have experimented with operationalizing “achievement” in two different ways: as scores on homework assignments or performance on the final. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success as Persistence (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more troubling aspects of MOOCs to date is their low completion rate, which averages no more than 10%. This was true of 6.002x as well, with less than 5% of the students who signed up at any one time completing the course. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to understand more about stop out, so we are also operationalizing “success” as “persistence throughout the duration of the course.” Here, too, we are working with multiple possible definitions: persistence can be “interaction with any part of the course in any subsequent week” or “interaction with a specific course component in any subsequent week.” (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are then estimating a survival function based on student use of resources. While the use of some resources seems to predict an increased likelihood of stopping out of the class in the next week, interactions with other resources seem to predict a decrease in likelihood of stop out. We are extending this model to look at time-varying risk functions—factors that might increase the likelihood of stopping out at the beginning of the course but have the opposite effect at the end of the course. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on the Discussion Forum and On-Campus Use of 6.002x (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 12,000 discussion threads were initiated during 6.002x, including almost 100,000 individual posts, providing a rich sample for this analysis. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we know that, on average, only 3% of all students participated in the discussion forum. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, 52% of the certificate earners were active on the forum. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our initial approach in exploring the discussion forum has been to categorize these interactions very broadly along two dimensions: (a) topic (i.e., course content, course structure or policies, course website or technology, social/affective), and (b) role of the student posting (i.e., help-seeker/ information-seeker or help-giver/information-giver). (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we will be able to describe the general purposes for which the forum was used (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what is the nature of the interactions that create a productive collaboration? (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to understand how “discussion” might have helped 6.002x students to unravel a misconception, understand a difficult topic, or employ an algorithmic procedure. To do this, we are looking more specifically at threads in which students sought and received help on complex homework problems. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are examining the quantity of interactivity between question askers and responders, as well as inferences made by both parties. As yet another means of exploring these data, we are experimenting with social network analysis to see if it yields findings about the nature and longevity of group formation in 6.002x. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appearance of MOOCs in higher education has been swift—so swift, in fact, that it could be called unprecedented. Since their introduction only a scant 18 months ago, there has been no shortage of prophecies about their potential impact. Those predictions have run the gamut from the wildly hopeful to the bleakly dire. The optimists see MOOCs expanding access to previously disenfranchised groups of students, developing new methods of pedagogy for deeper, more sustained learning, and building global communities focused not on the latest fad or celebrity, but on education. Doomsayers predict the end of liberal learning, a generation unable to communicate in face-to-face classrooms, and even the eventual demise of the university. What the two camps agree on—and what history and current events indicate— is that it is unlikely that higher educational will not be affected by MOOCs. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An independent implementation of an interesting web annotation system. This paper focuses on evaluating students&amp;rsquo; acceptance of the system and how the use of web annotations have helped students learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of annotations in this study, and in many others, has been focused on knowledge sharing, especially in the process of consuming or making sense of shared readings. How could annotations be pulled together to advance group knowledge building with creation as a goal, and across a variety of documents, could be a next-step challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limitation of current Web-based collaborative learning is the restricted ability of students to create and share individual annotations with annotated documents. (p. 752)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study designed a personalized annotation management system 2.0 (PAMS 2.0) for managing, sharing, and reusing individual and collaborative annotations as well as providing a shared mechanism for discussion about shared annotations among multiple users. (p. 752)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purposes of this study are three-fold: (1) to understand students’ perceived attitudes toward the use of PAMS 2.0; (2) to investigate the effects of different annotation sharing scenarios on quantity of annotation and its influence on learning achievements; and (3) to examine the relationship between learning achievements and quantity of annotation. (p. 752)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Web 2.0 technology has provided more opportunities to develop Web-based collaborative learning systems attracted learners to participate in collaborative learning context to learn from their collaborators (Barak, Herscoviz, Kaberman, &amp;amp; Dori, 2009; Jones, Blackey, Fitzgibbon, &amp;amp; Chew, 2010). (p. 752)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the socialecultural activity theory, the latest Web 2.0 technology can play a role as mediator for enriching technical courses with learning teams (Nardi, 1996). In fact, in Web 2.0-based systems, cross-platform environments and synchronous or/and asynchronous are all proper functions that provide learners with more equal opportunities for sharing information, retrieving information, and active interaction with other learners and instructors (Barak et al., 2009). (p. 752)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional teaching and learning context, learners used to make marks on paper-based textbooks or handouts. Taking notes on textbooks or handouts is a common learning behavior. Furthermore, annotation offers a useful tool to increase deep reading of textual resource (Marshall, 1997, 1998), this is, the annotation causes a learner to think about the content that they are about to annotate (p. 752)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert (2009) mentioned that annotation made based on the profile of learners can be very useful in knowledge sharing and knowledge sharing in a collaborative environment can be drawn. (p. 753)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learners catch the attention of group members using annotations to help them focus on specific document content. Learners can also organize the document content with annotations, and use indexes or reminders for later reference. By reviewing others’ thoughts in the form of annotations, learners can collaboratively explore and exploit valuable knowledge. (p. 753)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Annotation and annotation systems (p. 753)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid duplication and reinvention wherever possible, the proposed annotation model is derived from the Dublin Core. (p. 753)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much annotation systems have been proposed during the last decade. The Word Wide Web Consortium has proposed a Web-based annotation system called Annotea (2001). Annotea improves collaboration by sharing annotations, bookmarks, and their combinations. (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LeeTiernan and Grudin (2001) proposed a prototype that allows viewers of audio and video to create and share textual annotations that are synchronized with the multimedia. Researchers found that group practices can increase engagement and system use, and also suggest possible further improvement to the annotation system. Nokelainen, Kurhila, Miettinen, Floreen, and Tirri (2003) proposed a document-based annotation system for shared their own annotations. The usefulness of the annotation system was evaluated in a real-life collaborative learning context. Yang et al. (2004) proposed a personalized annotation management system. Researchers also demonstrated that personalized annotation enhances knowledge sharing and learning in students’ online learning activity. The overall results indicated that learners who are willing to do real task with the tools provided by the annotation system, and are able to elaborate what they are doing, produce both highest quality annotations and learning achievements. (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent studies pointed out the usefulness of annotation systems on facilitating learning. Nokelainen et al. (2003) indicated that annotation systems can bring about students’ learning motivation, and they want to use the systems elaborated more about their tasks. Hwang et al. (2007) designed several sharing activities in which annotation increase students’ learning efficiency. Researchers believe that it is not easy to underhand annotation systems for learning without considering their interaction with annotation sharing strategies. Marshall and Brush (2004) also suggested that knowledge sharing strategies provide an opportunity to facilitate making individual knowledge to public ones. Thus, knowledge accumulated its value when it is shared. (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Technology acceptance model: TAM (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) was developed by Davis (1989) to evaluate how users come to accept and use a technology. Based on user acceptance of the technology, TAM theory proposes perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use to explain a user’s attitude toward a system. (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and development of the PAMS 2.0 system (p. 754)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. The system architecture (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAMS 2.0 adopts a client/server architecture, where the system architecture comprises two separate parts: an annotator side and a server side. (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the server side, four managers provide four system-level supporting services: an anchoring position mechanism, a document manager, an association manager, and a user manager. (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the annotator side, four handlers collaborate to process annotation creation, retrieval, discussion, and management. Annotators can create, edit, and retrieve their own annotations. (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. Annotation modeling (p. 754)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research objective and methodology (p. 757)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study aims at exploring students’ annotation behavior and uncovers the relationship between relevant variables (including learning scenarios, learning achievements, and quantity of annotation). Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of different annotation sharing scenarios on quantity of annotation and its influence on learning achievements. (p. 757)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) What are students’ attitudes toward the use of PAMS 2.0? (2) What are the effects of different annotation sharing scenarios on quantity of annotation and its influence on learning achievements? (3) What is the relationship between learning achievements and quantity of annotation? (p. 757)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course involved face-to-face lectures, and used digital supplemental materials as articles. All participants were asked to study assigned articles and take course tests in different learning scenarios. (p. 757)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fig. 4. Students discuss a science article with group members in group reading exercises. (p. 758)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.3. Procedures (p. 759)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students in two classes were divided into small groups with each group containing two to four students, and each group participated in the arrangement of learning scenarios as shown in Table 1. Five learning scenarios were arranged for five learning topics as well as each topic containing articles and different sharing scenarios. The three and five scenarios were used to explore the influence of the midterm and final exams on learning behavior with the annotation. (p. 759)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;students in the experiment class were encouraged to make annotations directly on reading articles and to look up other collaborators’ annotations. (p. 759)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.3. Analysis of learning achievements (p. 761)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result showed that there was no significant difference between the post-test scores of the two classes. (p. 762)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.3.1.2. Correlation between learning achievements and quantity of annotation. A Pearson correlation was employed to analyze the correlation between learning achievements and quantity of annotation in the experiment class. There was also no significant positive correlation (the correlation1⁄40.26, p1⁄40.81&amp;gt;0.05) between learning achievements and quantity of annotation (p. 762)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.3.2.2. Correlation between learning achievements and quantity of annotation. According to the result of the Pearson correlation, there was a significant positive correlation (the correlation &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 0.337, p &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 0.022 &amp;lt; 0.05) between learning achievements and quantity of annotation (the quantity of annotation &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 608, mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 13.22, SD &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 3.04). The correlation of the second scenario is stronger than that of the first scenario. This is because students in the experiment class become familiar with PAMS 2.0, easily create individual annotation, and read the annotations of the other collaborators in collaborative learning environments. (p. 763)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.3.3.2. Correlation between learning achievements and quantity of annotation. According to the result of the Pearson correlation, there was a significant positive correlation (the correlation &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 0.390, p &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 0.007 &amp;lt; 0.05) between learning achievements and quantity of annotation (the quantity of annotation &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 672, mean &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 14.61, SD &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 2.94) in the experiment class. (p. 763)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusions (p. 765)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study developed a Personalized Annotation Management System 2.0 (PAMS 2.0), as a Web 2.0 collaborative annotation system, for managing, sharing, and reusing individual/collaborative annotations as well as providing a shared mechanism for discussion about shared annotations among multiple users. From the experiment results of the practical computer science course, several interesting and important findings were derived. (p. 765)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students would like to use PAMS 2.0 in group learning scenarios because of they believe PAMS 2.0 easy to use and stable. Thus, most of students thought that PAMS 2.0 helped them think carefully about understanding collaborators’ annotations with annotated documents in collaborative learning context. (p. 765)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytical results of learning achievements show that the use of the PAMS 2.0 system is able to increase students’ achievements in the second and fourth scenarios, and this finding is similar to that obtained by Hwang et al. (2007). (p. 765)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, according to the results of the third scenario and the fifth scenario, there is no significant difference between learning achievements of the experiment class and the control class. (p. 765)&lt;/p&gt;

An empirical investigation of the critical factors influencing learner satisfaction. Computers &amp;amp; Education, 50(4), 1183–1202. &lt;a href=&#34;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.007&#34;&gt;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on earlier research on e-learning, this study aims to build a model of learner satisfaction involving multiple dimensions including course, instructor, learner, tech, design, and environmental dimensions. The presentation of the study is succinct (as one could normally expect from the journal), in some cases too succinct to clarify doubts about the dataset (e.g., potential sampling bias) and meaningfulness of results (correlations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey was conducted to investigate the critical factors affecting learners’ satisfaction in e-Learning. The results revealed that learner computer anxiety, instructor attitude toward e-Learning, e-Learning course flexibility, e-Learning course quality, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and diversity in assessments are the critical factors affecting learners’ perceived satisfaction. (p. 1183)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction (p. 1183)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-Learning is the use of telecommunication technology to deliver information for education and training. (p. 1183)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior studies of e-Learning (p. 1184)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-Learning is basically a web-based system that makes information or knowledge available to users or learners and disregards time restrictions or geographic proximity. Although online learning has advantages over traditional face-to-face education (Piccoli et al., 2001), concerns include time, labor intensiveness, and material resources involved in running e-Learning environments. (p. 1184)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many researchers from psychology and information system fields have identified important variables dealing with e-Learning. Among them, the technology acceptance model (Ajzen &amp;amp; Fishbein, 1977; Davis, Bagozzi, &amp;amp; Warshaw, 1989; Oliver, 1980), and the expectation and confirmation model (Bhattacherjee, 2001; Lin, Wu, &amp;amp; Tsai, 2005; Wu et al., 2006) have partially contributed to understanding e-Learning success. These models tended to focus on technology. (p. 1184)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in Table 1. Six dimensions are used to assess the factors, including student dimension, instructor dimension, course dimension, technology dimension, design dimension, and environment dimension. (p. 1184)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the six dimensions previously identified, thirteen factors were involved. In the learner dimension those factors are learner attitude toward computers, learner computer anxiety, and learner Internet self-efficacy. The factors of instructor response timeliness and instructor attitude toward e-Learning were identified in the instructor dimension, and e-Learning course flexibility, e-Learning course quality in the course dimension. The technology dimension factors were technology quality and Internet quality. Finally, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were identified in design dimension and diversity in assessment and learner perceived interaction with others in the environmental dimension. These factors discussed by previous researchers cover nearly every aspect of e-Learning environments; however, they have never been integrated into one framework subject to examination for validation and relationship. This research develops such a framework including those factors shown in Fig. 1. (p. 1184)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2. The subjects and the procedure (p. 1189)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;limitations?&lt;br /&gt;
 Unclear whether the participants would naturally bias responses to some of the variables. For example, if there were no peer interactions designed in those 16 courses, e-learners may have no clue about how to respond to related survey questions. (p. 1189)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-Learner volunteers enrolled in 16 different e-Learning courses at two public universities in Taiwan participated in the study. A total of 645 surveys were distributed by email. The initial and follow-up mailing generated 295 usable responses, resulting in a response rate of 45.7%. (p. 1189)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more discussion needed here&lt;br /&gt;
 The authors should have briefly discussed the correlations here. What do they imply? How do correlations inform the regression analysis? etc. (p. 1192)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.3. Hypothesis testing (p. 1192)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion (p. 1193)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From stepwise multiple regression analysis, seven variables are proven to have critical relationships with e-Learner satisfaction, namely learner computer anxiety, instructor attitude toward e-Learning, e-Learning course flexibility, course quality, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and diversity in assessment. The results suggested that 66.1% (adjusted R2 = 66.1%, F-value = 82.96, p &amp;lt; .001) of the perceived e-Learner satisfaction’s variance can be explained by those seven critical variables. (p. 1193)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.1. Learner dimension (p. 1193)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the mentality of treating computers as a necessary tool has matured, users’ attitude, efficacy or skills should no longer be considered an issue in the e-Learning environment. (p. 1194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anxiety might still exist with certain users. (p. 1194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.2. Instructor dimension (p. 1194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since not every instructor is interested in teaching online, institutions should select instructors carefully. Teaching online differs from face-to-face education. Professional expertise should not be the sole criterion in selecting online instructors. (p. 1194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.3. Course dimension (p. 1194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course flexibility and quality are both proven to be significant in this research. Flexibility of an e-Learning course is a strong indication of student satisfaction. (p. 1194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all independent variables, course quality has the strongest association with satisfaction. It includes overall course design, teaching materials, interactive discussion arrangements, etc. (p. 1194)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.4. Technology dimension (p. 1195)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is reasonable to claim that the technologies used in e-Learning environments are fairly mature. (p. 1195)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.5. Design dimension (p. 1195)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;perceived usefulness by learners significantly influences their satisfactio (p. 1195)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceived ease of use also has a significant impact on e-Learner satisfaction. Users’ notion of ease of use is an important antecedent to perceptions of satisfaction. (p. 1195)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.6. Environment dimension (p. 1195)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the two factors involved in environmental dimension, diversity in assessment has a significant impact on perceived e-Learner satisfaction. (p. 1195)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study provides insights for institutions to strengthen their e-Learning implementations and further improve learner satisfaction. (p. 1196)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the research proposes an integrated model covering a variety of factors influencing e-Learners’ satisfaction; it might not be comprehensive due to the limitations of time and resources. Second, this work focuses on metrics from a specific digital learning system. The variance in different systems is not further investigated. Third, the dependent variable of this study is a single indicator, perceived e-Learner satisfaction. (p. 1196)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the statistical methods used in this study are based on traditional assumptions; thus our results are established with these assumptions as a base. Finally, this research used stepwise multiple regression analysis to test the significance of variables. In the future, other statistical methods such as SEM (e.g., LISREL, EQS, PLS), or neural network may be employed to explore cause/effect relationship among variables. (p. 1196)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The units of interaction for our analyses are documents called “notes”. Patterns of interaction amongst participants are mediated by these documents. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Representations and Analytic Manipulations (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content of the notes is used to create high-dimensional vector representations via LSA. Relationships between these vectors, as well as relationships amongst participants, are represented using network graphs and highlighted adjacency matrices. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of time-based analyses has also been noted (Haythornthwaite, 2001 ; Martínez, Dimitriadis, Rubia, Gomez, &amp;amp; de la Fuente, 2003 ). The study by de Laat et al. ( 2007 ) was the fi rst application of using SNA to illustrate how patterns change over time and the relationship of those patterns to teaching and learning. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we describe software designed to support the visualisation of learner models based on social and semantic networks. We present a description of the KSV, a prototypic software system on which our new software, KISSME, is based. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some of the most interesting diagrams that can be produced using the KSV are based on the superposition of different link types on the same layout. An example of a representation that combines chronology, authorship, structural links and recently opened documents is shown in Fig. 21.2 (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key innovations of the KSV was the use of fl exible thresholds in the creation of network representations. This is what allowed us to create visualisations of LSA-based representations of texts. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualising Student Models: The Knowledge, Interaction and Semantic Student Model Explorer (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, all that we are using LSA for is to generate mathematical representations of the participants’ contributions to the discourse space. We can then use those mathematical representations in a variety of ways. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach is somewhat different: we are interested in combining information about patterns of interaction among participants with information about the content of those contributions. We too take a Vygotskian approach: that optimal learning will take place when interactions occur between individuals who are neither too similar nor too dissimilar from each other, based on the semantics of what they have written. This approach of combining SNA and latent semantic network analy- sis is an example of the sort of “multidimensional” network championed by Contractor ( 2009 ). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are interested in testing the Vygotskian hypothesis that uptake (Suthers, Dwyer, Medina &amp;amp; Vatrapu, 2010 ) is most likely to occur when the semantic relatedness of the corresponding contributor models is neither too high nor too low. We refer to this intermediate similarity of latent seman- tic learner models (LSLM) as “compatibility” in the next section where we apply this framework to a case study. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case Study (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were interested in examining the relationship between the intensity of social interaction (reading each others’ notes) and the semantic similarity of what each participant had written. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there were abundant reading events shared between two learners and their LSLM suggested they were compatible then we would predict that there might have been “pivotal moments” or a point in time at which the semantic structure of the com- munity changed in an important way. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective analysis, and therefore we cannot intervene in an attempt to engineer change. However, there is some preliminary evidence that there is a relationship between the intensity of interactions and learners who are semantically similar, but not too similar, to each other based on what they have written in the online discourse space. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-1&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlene recommended this article when discussing my thesis work on (personal) epistemology. This article&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on World 3 and collective epistemology prompts me to rethink my research design. Combining with my thoughts from reading [[ref:forrester2006|Forrester&amp;rsquo;s thesis]] about epistemology, I am thinking about research of epistemology related to promisingness in two important directions. I am putting them as two independent dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;design mode vs. belief mode epistemology
  individual vs. collective epistemology&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If epistemology is framed this way, our thinking about knowledge building and other instructional approaches can be framed this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;individual + belief &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; knowledge acquisition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;individual + design &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;lonely invention&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social + belief &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; inquiry learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social + design &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; knowledge building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this article is not really about epistemology. Its discussions about theoretical background of CSILE, cases, empirical evidence showing its effectiveness, and ineffectivenss of applying &amp;lsquo;current&amp;rsquo; cognitive science on thinking of World 3 are all very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clippings&#34;&gt;Clippings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clips&#34;&gt;Clips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Intentional learning&amp;rdquo; is not just a synonym for &amp;ldquo;motivation.&amp;rdquo; There are students who are motivated to do well in school
and who apply themselves seriously to school tasks, but who are not in fact pursuing cognitive goals. Instead, their goals are formed around
doing well on the tasks themselves or on looking good in comparison to others (Ng and Bereiter 1991; Nicholis 1984).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring
knowledge to the forefront , we wanted a medium in which knowledge would be objectified, represented in an overt form so that it could be
evaluated, examined for gaps and inadequacies, added to, revised, and reformulated .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
subsequent history of the CSILE project has been a history of increasing emphasis on this social dimension of knowledge construction.
Cooperative learning is, of course, a popular notion ; but typically, it refers to students either cooperating in a group
task or else helping one another achieve individually realized cognitive objectives. Can a school class, as a collective, have the goal of
understanding gravity or electricity? Can it sustain progress toward this goal even though individual members of the class may flag in their efforts or go off on tangents? Can one speak of the classagain, considered as a community, not as a mere collection of individuals -
achieving an understanding that is not merely a tabulation of what the individual students understand? These questions have on the one hand led us into issues of educational epistemology, but on the other hand have led into what we believe are promising new avenues of educational design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;theoretical-and-research-background&#34;&gt;Theoretical and Research Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these efforts have been moderately successful, it is noteworthy that some cognitive researchers originally involved in cognitive strategy instruction have since moved to a more broadly social orientation , in which the emphasis is on building a classroom culture supportive of active knowledge construction rather than relying on strategy instruction aimed at the individual student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The version of Vygotsky&amp;rsquo; s sociocognitive theory that is gaining popularity
among educators takes us halfway to another view of knowledge, with its proposal that cognitive structures are first formed socially and then reconstructed internally. However, as this idea has been taken up by North American educators, the emphasis is on the internal part, with social activity treated as a means of advancing the child &amp;rsquo;s personal knowledge . That emphasis is problematic insofar as it has dictated a
corresponding neglect of how cognitive structures are supported by social structures and hence fails to account for the internalization
process itself .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of knowledge having a primarily social existence thus does not enjoy a natural fit with educational thought . This idea has
proved significant in the philosophy and sociology of science, however (Harre 1984; Latour 1987; Popper 1972).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is always to what extent do children think and act like scientists, not to what extent does a
school class function like a scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individualistic focus has tended to distort the knowledge-building process.
the scientific enterprise is reduced to the exercise of a variety of skills, such as observation, measurement, and experimentation .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to get students involved in improving the knowledge itself rather than with
but it represents the normal arrangement of priorities in the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; improving their own minds. This is a radical turnabout for schooling, world of knowledge building .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;csile-as-a-medium-for-working-in-world-3&#34;&gt;CSILE as a Medium for Working in World 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, it cannot do much by itself, but it has turned out that CSILE is not nearly so neutral a medium as one might suppose. It introduces certain blases and enables cetain kinds of information
flow that are at least conducive to educational change. First, the physical conditions especially the fact that not all children can be working
on CSILE at the same time militate against the traditional schoolwork model, where all the students are doing the same thing at the same time. Second, CSILE opens up a significant channel for communication in the classroom that is not mediated through the teacher&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made this one memorable was a one-line note which stated simply, &amp;ldquo;Mendel worked on Karen&amp;rsquo;s question.&amp;rdquo; it was a problem that had a history , a problem that had mattered to other people , and that by working on it they became a part of something larger . All we really want to claim , however , is that the remark is suggestive of how working in World 3 might come to have a much
deeper and richer significance for students than working in World 2, the world of their personal interests and puzzlements .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;evidence-of-effects&#34;&gt;Evidence of Effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our objectives for CSILE have moved from promoting intentional
learning in individual students to supporting the collective construction of public ( World 3) knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two sources of data then are
relevant for testing the idea that construction of knowledge is a social and not just an individual activity : World 3 effects (e.g., improved
knowledge quality and evidence of constructive activity in students&amp;rsquo; collective work ) and World 2 effects (e.g., a shift toward mastery goals and away from performance goals, and evidence of deeper understanding ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardized Achievement Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depth of Explanation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphical Knowledge Representation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio Ratings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constructive Process es in Reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beliefs about Learning. A nine-item three-alternative forced-choice instrument. mastery-oriented. (1) you could tell you learn if &amp;hellip; (2) &amp;hellip; was most important for learning from text?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-s-the-cognitive-science&#34;&gt;Where&amp;rsquo;s the Cognitive Science&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the focus of our work has shifted from World 2 to World 3 from
goings on within the individual mind to knowledge as a public construction we of course have moved farther away from cognitive science as it has generally been conceived. But cognitive science itself is
in a considerable state of flux , and many of its changes are in the same direction as our research and have had an important influence on how we think about what we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective teacher or instructional designer, according to this
which the class&amp;rsquo;s knowledge is regarded as a public , objective entity conception, must be able to move flexibly between a World 3 view, in that the teacher must help develop optimally, and a World 2 view, in which the teacher works with hypothetical mental structures attributed to individual students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard -brand cognitive science is helpful in working at the World 2 level , but it is essentially mute with respect to World 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article evaluates the Educational Participation Scale–Modified (EPS-M) developed by O’Connor (1979, 1982) in the context of social work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a nice literature review of subversions of EPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to evaluate the measurement model and theory underlying the Educational Participation Scale–Modified (EPS-M) using confirmatory factor analysis. A probability sample of 225 licensed social workers in Maryland completed the mailed survey. The findings support a six independent factor model. Results also support the EPS-M as a valid and reliable measure for identifying motivational orientations of social workers who pursue continuing professional education. Professional knowledge was the most frequently reported motivational orientation. Implications regarding social workers’ motivational orientations and the design of continuing professional education activities are discussed. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been multiple versions of the EPS:
1. The original version was published in 1971 by Boshier with 48 items and a 9-point scale.
2. In 1976, a modified version of the EPS was developed, which had 40 items and a 4-point scale (Boshier, 1976).
3. O’Connor (1979, 1982) modified the original EPS scale by adding a 0 end point denoting no change, creating a 10-point scale. O’Connor also added 8 additional questions to bring the total number to 56 questions.
4. Boshier (1991) developed a new scale (Form A) with 42 items. The EPS-Form A was correlated with the original EPS scale (Boshier, 1991).
5. Garst and Ried (1999) used the original EPS scale and created another modified version EPS with 43 items and a 5-point scale citing Mergener’s doctoral dissertation. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPS-M (O’Connor, 1979) scoring criteria were selected for several reasons, which were primarily empirically based. The subscales’ internal consistency reliabilities were better, and there were no alpha if item deleted problems in this sample compared with alternative scoring methods (Boshier &amp;amp; Collins, 1983). Additionally, the scale has been used with a professional population participating in continuing professional education, which is similar to the population and educational activities in this study (O’Connor, 1979, 1982; Thomas, 1986). A more recent study by Garst and Ried (1999) also chose a modified version of the original EPS over the EPS-Form A. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend recommended this book to me as a useful guide for English writing. (Some of the advice might be dated though, since it was written a century ago.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-ii-elementary-rules-of-usage-p-9&#34;&gt;Chapter II ELEMENTARY RULES OF USAGE (p. 9)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Form the possessive singular of nouns with ’s (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles’s friend (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names in -es and -is, the possessive Jesus’, and such forms as for conscience’ sake, for righteousness’ sake. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;red, white, and blue (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why comma is omitted in this case?? (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He opened the letter, read it and made a note of its contents. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the names of business firms the last comma is omitted (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abbreviations etc. and jr. are always preceded by a comma, and except at the end of a sentence, followed by one. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a parenthetic expression is preceded by a conjunction, place the first comma before the conjunction, not after it. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He saw us coming, and unaware that we had learned of his treachery, greeted us with a smile. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Place a comma before and or but introducing an independent clause (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentences of this type, isolated from their context, may seem to be in need of rewriting. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, and, is the least specific of connectives. Used between independent clauses, it indicates only that a relation exists between them without defining that relation. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Do not join independent clauses by a comma (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb, such as accordingly, besides, so, then, therefore, or thus, and not by a conjunction, the semicolon is still required. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never been in the place before; so I had difficulty in finding my way about. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, however, it is best, in writing, to avoid using so in this manner; there is danger that the writer who uses it at all may use it too often. A simple correction, usually serviceable, is to omit the word so, and begin the first clause with as: (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I had never been in the place before, I had difficulty in finding my way about. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) Do not break sentences in two (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(7) A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentences violating this rule are often ludicrous. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-iii-elementary-principles-of-composition-p-19&#34;&gt;Chapter III ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF COMPOSITION (p. 19)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(9) Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the paragraph has been written, it should be examined to see whether subdivision will not improve it. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of each paragraph is a signal to him that a new step in the development of the subject has been reached. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule, single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exception may be made of sentences of transition, indicating the relation between the parts of an exposition or argument. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(10) As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the most generally useful kind of paragraph, particularly in exposition and argument, is that in which A. the topic sentence comes at or near the beginning; B. the succeeding sentences explain or establish or develop the statement made in the topic sentence; and C. the final sentence either emphasizes the thought of the topic sentence or states some important consequence. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending with a digression, or with an unimportant detail, is particularly to be avoided. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the paragraph forms part of a larger composition, its relation to what precedes, or its function as a part of the whole, may need to be expressed. This can sometimes be done by a mere word or phrase (again; therefore; for the same reason) in the topic sentence. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, however, it is expedient to precede the topic sentence by one or more sentences of introduction or transition. If more than one such sentence is required, it is generally better to set apart the transitional sentences as a separate paragraph. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(11) Use the active voice (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely discard the passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need of making a particular word the subject of the sentence will often, as in these examples, determine which voice is to be used. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule, avoid making one passive depend directly upon another. (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold was not allowed to be exported. It was forbidden to export gold (The export of gold was prohibited). (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common fault is to use as the subject of a passive construction a noun which expresses the entire action, leaving to the verb no function beyond that of completing the sentence. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey of this region was made in 1900. This region was surveyed in 1900. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(12) Put statements in positive form (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, non-committal language. (p. 26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as a rule, it is better to express a negative in positive form. (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not honest dishonest (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(13) Omit needless words (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the question as to whether whether (the question whether) there is no doubt but that no doubt (doubtless) used for fuel purposes used for fuel (p. 27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he is a man who he in a hasty manner hastily this is a subject which this subject His story is a strange one. His story is strange. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In especial the expression the fact that should be revised out of every sentence in which it occurs. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is, which was, and the like are often superfluous. (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As positive statement is more concise than negative, and the active voice more concise than the passive (p. 28)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(14) Avoid a succession of loose sentences (p. 29)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(15) Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This principle, that of parallel construction, requires that expressions of similar content and function should be outwardly similar. The likeness of form enables the reader to recognize more readily the likeness of content and function. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unskilful writer often violates this principle, from a mistaken belief that he should constantly vary the form of his expressions. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correlative expressions (both, and; not, but; not only, but also; either, or; first, second, third; and the like) should be followed by the same grammatical construction. (p. 30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(16) Keep related words together (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as a rule, be separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred to the beginning. (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This objection, however, does not usually hold when the order (p. 31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is interrupted only by a relative clause or by an expression in apposition. Nor does it hold in periodic sentences in which the interruption is a deliberately used means of creating suspense (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative pronoun should come, as a rule, immediately after its antecedent. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrote three articles about his adventures in Spain, which were published in Harper’ s Magazine. He published in Harper’s Magazine three articles about his adventures in Spain. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the antecedent consists of a group of words, the relative comes at the end of the group, unless this would cause ambiguity. (p. 32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(17) In summaries, keep to one tense (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summarizing the action of a drama, the writer should always use the present tense. (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the exceptions noted, whichever tense the writer chooses, he should use throughout. Shifting from one tense to the other gives the appearance of uncertainty and irresolution (p. 33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(18) Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways. Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude. (p. 34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other prominent position in the sentence is the beginning. Any element in the sentence, other than the subject, becomes emphatic when placed first. (p. 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-iv-a-few-matters-of-form-p-37&#34;&gt;Chapter IV A FEW MATTERS OF FORM (p. 37)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerals. Do not spell out dates or other serial numbers. Write them in figures or in Roman notation, as may be appropriate. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quotations. Formal quotations, cited as documentary evidence, are introduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks. (p. 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-v-words-and-expressions-commonly-misused-p-41&#34;&gt;Chapter V WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS COMMONLY MISUSED (p. 41)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case. TheConciseOxfordDictionarybeginsitsdefinitionofthisword:“instanceofa thing’s occurring; usual state of affairs.” In these two senses, the word is usually unnecessary. (p. 41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly. Usedindiscriminatelybysomespeakers,muchasothersusevery,tointensify any and every statement. A mannerism of this kind, bad in speech, is even worse in writing. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character. Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of wordiness. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare. To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances, between objects regarded as essentially of different order; to compare with is mainly to point out differences, between objects regarded as essentially of the same order. Thus life has been compared to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be compared with the British Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be compared with modern London. (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to. Incorrectly used for through, because of, or owing to, in adverbial phrases: “He lost the first game, due to carelessness.” In correct use related as predicate or as modifier to a particular noun: “This invention is due to Edison;” “losses due to preventable fires.” (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effect. As noun, means result; as verb, means to bring about, accomplish (not to be confused with affect, which means “to influence”). (p. 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etc. Not to be used of persons. Equivalent to and the rest, and so forth, and hence not to be used if one of these would be insufficient, that is, if the reader would be left in doubt as to any important particulars. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of a list introduced by such as, for example, or any similar expression, etc. is incorrect. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factor. A hackneyed word; the expressions of which it forms part can usually be replaced by something more direct and idiomatic. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His superior training was the great factor in his winning the match. He won the match by being better trained. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fix. Colloquial in America for arrange, prepare, mend. In writing restrict it to its literary senses, fasten, make firm or immovable, etc. (p. 43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is a man who. A common type of redundant expression (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However. In the meaning nevertheless, not to come first in its sentence or clause. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roads were almost impassable. However, we at last succeeded in reaching camp. The roads were almost impassable. At last, however, we succeeded in reaching camp. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When however comes first, it means in whatever way or to whatever extent. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of. Not to be used as a substitute for rather (before adjectives and verbs) (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less. Should not be misused for fewer. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less refers to quantity, fewer to number. “His troubles are less than mine” means “His troubles are not so great as mine.” “His troubles are fewer than mine” means “His troubles are not so numerous as mine.” (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line, along these lines. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;particularly in the phrase along these lines, that a writer who aims at freshness or originality had better discard it entirely. (p. 44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is studying along the line of French literature. He is studying French literature. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literal,literally. Oftenincorrectlyusedinsupportofexaggerationorviolentmetaphor. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lose out. Meant to be more emphatic than lose, but actually less so, because of its commonness. The same holds true of try out, win out, sign up, register up. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nature. Often simply redundant, used like character. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acts of a hostile natureHostile acts (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearby. Adverbialphrase,notyetfullyacceptedasgoodEnglish,thoughtheanalogy of close by and hard by seems to justify it. Near, or near at hand, is as good, if not better. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, ofttimes. Archaic forms, no longer in good use. The modern word is often. (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most. Avoid beginning essays or paragraphs with this formula (p. 45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People. The people is a political term, not to be confused with the public. From the people comes political support or opposition; from the public comes artistic appreciation or commercial patronage. The word people is not to be used with words of number, in place of persons. If of “six people” five went away, how many “people” would be left? (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respective, respectively. These words may usually be omitted with advantage. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one mile and two mile runs were won by Jones and Cummings respectively. The one mile and two mile runs were won by Jones and by Cummings. (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some kinds of formal writing, as in geometrical proofs, it may be necessary to use respectively (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. Avoid, in writing, the use of so as an intensifier: “so good;” “so warm;” “so delightful.” (p. 46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State. Not to be used as a mere substitute for say, remark. Restrict it to the sense of express fully or clearly, as, “He refused to state his objections.” (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studentbody. Aneedlessandawkwardexpression,meaningnomorethanthesimple word students. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System. Frequently used without need. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very. Use this word sparingly. Where emphasis is necessary, use words strong in themselves. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewpoint. Write point of view, but do not misuse this, as many do, for view or opinion. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While. Avoid the indiscriminate use of this word for and, but, and although. Many writers use it frequently as a substitute for and or but, either from a mere desire to vary the connective, or from uncertainty which of the two connectives is the more appropriate. In this use it is best replaced by a semicolon. (p. 47)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the writer will do well to use while only with strict literalness, in the sense of during the time that. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whom. Often incorrectly used for who before he said or similar expressions, when it is really the subject of a following verb. (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His brother, whom he said would send him the money His brother, who he said would send him the money (p. 48)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth while. Overworked as a term of vague approval and (with not) of disapproval. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of worth while before a noun (“a worth while story”) is indefensible. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would. A conditional statement in the first person requires should, not would. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should not have succeeded without his help. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equivalent of shall in indirect quotation after a verb in the past tense is should, not would. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He predicted that before long we should have a great surprise. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To express habitual or repeated action, the past tense, without would, is usually sufficient, and from its brevity, more emphatic. (p. 49)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thompson, K., Ashe, D., Carvalho, L., Goodyear, P., Kelly, N., &amp;amp; Parisio, M. (2013). Processing and Visualizing Data in Complex Learning Environments. American Behavioral Scientist, 57(10), 1401–1420. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1177&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;0002764213479368&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the proposed framework and model. But the presence of LA in Case 1 is especially minimal. Case 2 involves much human coding. Appears to be a more traditional CSCL research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discuss, using the cases of two learning environments, how structure affects the behavior of learners and, in turn, how that behavior has the potential to affect learning. (p. 1401)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics has focused on making sense of “big data,” data usually collected from learning management systems (e.g., Macfadyen &amp;amp; Dawson, 2010). The automatic extraction of data is then used for analysis at the course and student levels (e.g., social network analysis; Haythornthwaite &amp;amp; de Laat, 2011). Often, learning analytics focuses on the aim of identifying highor low-achieving students so that an intervention can be made effectively (e.g., Dawson, Macfadyen, &amp;amp; Lockyer, 2009). (p. 1401)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
 Wondering how many would agree with these statements. (p. 1401)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We describe our experiences processing and visualizing data in two complex learning environments. The first is an informal online learning environment used in Open University courses, open to anyone. The second is a small group of master’s students collaborating on a task. Throughout this article, the analytical relationship that we draw attention to is between the structure of a learning environment (virtual or physical; the “designable component”) and the learners’ behavior. For each case study, we discuss the selection of the elements and information this provides about the learners. We then discuss ways to apply other learning analytics techniques to these case studies. (p. 1402)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital technology, as with other objects in the broader material world, is not neutral and has ways of influencing human perception and action. (p. 1402)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The links between physical properties, perception, and action involve human processes, such as thinking and interpretation, that require varying degrees of conscious attention, mental effort, or cognitive load (Kahneman, 2011). (p. 1403)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed an analytical framework to identify and represent key elements of complex learning environments, which allows us to explore the nature of the physical, digital, and human elements within learning environments; what and how tools, texts, and artifacts are produced and/or manipulated; and the types of tasks, rules, and divisions of labor that become established within a range of learning contexts (Carvalho &amp;amp; Goodyear, in press). The framework establishes four analytical dimensions. Three of these reflect the major design components, which we label set design (the physical-digital “stage” on which learning activity is situated; the tools, artifacts, and so on that come to hand); epistemic design (tasks proposed, knowledge implicated); and social design (such as roles, divisions of labor). Since network participants’ activities also result in rearrangements of the learning environment, we use a fourth analytic dimension to capture co-creation and co-configuration. (p. 1403)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analytical framework offers ways of identifying and representing key elements of complex learning environments. (p. 1403)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researcher needs to see the big picture and to gain an overview of how the individual data elements interact and relate. (p. 1405)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus in both cases discussed below is on the demonstration of expertise in individual learners as an indicator of successful collaboration. (p. 1405)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case Study 1: iSpot (p. 1406)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collected and analyzed comprised screenshots of the environment, featuring the design elements we were interested in: the butterfly icons in iSpot (Figure 2). The analysis of design elements was underpinned by concepts from semiotics and design. Nadin (1988) refers to design principles as being semiotic by nature (p. 1407)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to design means to structure a system of signs in such a way as to make possible the achievement of human goals: communication (as a form of social interaction), engineering (as a form of applied technical rationality), business (as a form of shared efficiency), architecture, art, education, etc. (p. 269) (p. 1408)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex learning environments require analytical tools to help people understand how design elements may influence or shape learning within a particular context. (p. 1408)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case Study 2: Face-to-Face Collaboration (p. 1409)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second case study involves technology-enhanced collaboration. The aim is to identify indicators of expertise used in a face-to-face learning environment, adapting learning analytics techniques to do so. (p. 1409)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corpus of student utterances available in a transcript from the audio files was used for the analysis. (p. 1409)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We coded the video data according to tool use and object of attention for each second (p. 1412)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 1415)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two case studies that we present here, notions from learning analytics are applied. The iSpot case study makes use of the data available from a community website to analyze the effects of a design feature of the learning environment, namely, the role of the icons (set) in communicating expertise and the way in which this changes over time. The second case study of face-to-face learning uses both physical and verbal data from interaction to analyze learning processes. In both cases, there is a set of data that demonstrates how to apply analytics techniques. Many techniques are applicable and it is through the application of analysis within a framework to answer a question that specific methods are selected. (p. 1415)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book chapter systematically introduces Chi&amp;rsquo;s theory about conceptual change. She thinks misconceptions and conceptual change happen on three grain sizes: false beliefs, flawed mental models, and ontological miscatogerization. Therefore, instructions to promote conceptual change should also be conducted on those three levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tong, F., Irby, B. J., Lara-Alecio, R., Guerrero, C., Fan, Y., &amp;amp; Huerta, M. (2014). A Randomized Study of a Literacy-Integrated Science Intervention for Low-Socio-economic Status Middle School Students: Findings from first-year implementation. International Journal of Science Education, 36(12), 2083–2109.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the findings from a randomized control trial study of reading/literacy-integrated science inquiry intervention after 1 year of implementation and the treatment effect on 5th-grade low-socio-economic African-American and Hispanic students’ achievement in science and English reading. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 94 treatment students and 194 comparison students from four randomized intermediate schools participate (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how were schools randomized? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we examined the effect of a one-year literacy-integrated science intervention delivered to fifth-grade Hispanic and African-American low- SES male and female students on their science and reading achievement. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intent (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science, Literacy and Ethnicity, SES, and Gender (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) (NCES, 2012b) data show that such ethnically diverse students score lower than mainstream students on science assessments—tests requiring scientific literacy. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SES was also a significant factor associated with reading achievement. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Lee (2005), there is a noted a lack of cultural congruence between the students’ home culture and language and the westernized ideals and language of science in the literature related to ethnically diverse students, who are more likely to come from low-SES families. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation of gender disparity in science achievement is actually more serious for diverse, low-SES students. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other researchers also have provided converging evidence that the gender gap in science achievement starts as early as elementary grade (Mullis, Dossey, Owen, &amp;amp; Phillips, 1993) and keeps increasing at the pre-high-school level (Drew, 1996). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science Inquiry (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new conceptual framework for the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS, 2012) promotes the use of science inquiry in science teaching and learning as scien- tific thinking and discourse are developed. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science inquiry has been successfully applied in increasing scientific understanding among ethnically diverse, low-SES students (Cuevas, Lee, Hart, &amp;amp; Deaktor, 2005)as well as promoting academic achievement over time (Amaral, Garrison, &amp;amp; Klentschy, 2002). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is critical to integrate literacy instruction (i.e. reading and writing) with science inquiry (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literacy/Reading and Science Integration (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of reading instruction with science instruction is important in foster- ing scientific understanding for several reasons. First, reading becomes a window into the acquisition of scientific knowledge. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, reading is a process that complements scientific reasoning. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, reading is inevitably associated stu- dents’ ability to comprehend and succeed on high stakes assessments in science; stu- dents with lower reading abilities will have much more difficulties comprehending questions and therefore are more likely to perform poorly on those exams, including content area in science (Maerten-Rivera, Myers, Lee, &amp;amp; Penfield, 2010). Finally, science curriculum that integrates content learning and literacy development can promote reading skills and, not surprisingly, science content knowledge for low- SES diverse students (Connor et al., 2010; Fang &amp;amp; Wei, 2010). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, as was reported by Connor et al. (2010), students who had initially lower literacy skills made the same amount of gains as the students who had stronger literacy skills, given the explicit reading instruction integrated into the content instruction. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hapgood and Palinscar (2007) proposed that science writing is an important approach, by which students ‘record questions of interest, document how they have set up investigations, represent data they have collected, and develop explanations for the phenomena they are investigating’ (p. 57). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review of the literature revealed that the number of studies addressing literacy and science instructional integration at the middle school level for ethnically diverse, low-SES students is very limited (August, Branum-Martin, Cardenas-Hagan, &amp;amp; Francis, 2009; Author, 2012; Palumbo &amp;amp; Sanacore, 2009). Furthermore, from a methodological perspective, experimental and quasi-experimental designs with these students are rare; few studies are longitudinal that result in positive intervention effect on student achievement (August et al., 2009; Lee &amp;amp; Luykx, 2006). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a literacy- integrated instructional intervention in academic science among Hispanic and African-American low-SES middle school students after one year of placement with comparison to the typical science instruction in the district (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we addressed the following research questions: (1) Do students’ performance differ on the district science benchmark tests by ethni- city (i.e. African-American vs. Hispanic), gender (male vs. female), and partici- pation in the literacy-embedded science intervention (i.e. treatment condition vs. comparison condition)? (2) Do students’ performance differ on the state-standardized science test by ethni- city, gender, and participation in the literacy-embedded science intervention? (3) Do students’ performance differ on the district reading benchmark tests and the state-standardized reading test by ethnicity, gender, and participation in the lit- eracy-embedded science intervention? (4) Do students’ performance differ on English oral reading fluency (ORF) by ethni- city, gender, and participation in the literacy-embedded science intervention? (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context and Participants (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study was part of a larger randomized, longitudinal, field-based research of lit- eracy-integrated science instruction delivered to ELL and non-ELL students from low-SES backgrounds (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The district was chosen because of the district’s (a) ease of access to learning programs (i.e. regular and English-learning) within the same district, (b) lengthy experience working with low- SES students of color, &amp;copy; consistency in educational philosophy and implementation, and (d) reputation for student academic achievement as reflected by its national Broad Foundation Prize award. In this study, we selected participants who were His- panic or African-American and who spoke fluent English. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 schools with prin- cipals’ approval from the district site were randomly assigned to treatment (enhanced practice, n ¼ 2) and comparison (typical practice, n ¼ 2) conditions. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both English language learners (ELLs) and low-SES non-ELLs in the same school received the same condition (enhanced or typical practice), so as to avoid contamination of the intervention between experimental and comparison classrooms. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reflects careful &amp;ldquo;control&amp;rdquo; (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers were ran- domly selected within the school for project participation, with four in treatment and eight in comparison schools (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good practice talking about teachers (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the overall project was designed to be experimental at the school level, and quasi-experimental at the student level, abiding by the state law (Texas Education Code, 1995) prohibiting random selection and assignment on basis on individual students for program place- ment. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axiology; ethics (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;only data collected from low-SES non-ELLs were included in the analysis, totaling 94 students from treatment schools (average age of 11.58 years, SD ¼ 0.75) and 194 comparison students (average age of 11.50 years, SD ¼ 0.71). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literacy-Integrated Science Intervention (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers in the treatment condition were trained bi-weekly to assess their pedagogical progress and conduct experiments and inquiry activities in the overall intervention of Content Area Reading in Science for English Literacy and Language Acquisition (CRISELLA, see explanation below) (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also reviewed and practiced upcoming lessons based on the structured and scripted lesson plans that specifically listed science objectives, reading objectives, English-as-second-language (ESL) strategies, and target vocabulary for each week. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson plan provided structure for teachers to model aca- demic science language, opportunities for students to practice using science academic language, and encouraged students to answer in complete sentences. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The science intervention was delivered in English for 85 minutes each day inclusive of the following major components: (a) Daily Oral and Written Language in Science (DOWLS) activity, in which students were presented with a science-related prompt and asked to think, record written responses, and discuss with a student partner and (b) CRISELLA, designed to improve students’ understanding of science (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;concepts through vocabulary development and extension in science-related exposi- tory texts. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the third component, &amp;copy; Written and Academic oral language Vocabulary development in English in Science (WAVES), students recorded and illustrated a glossary of aca- demic science vocabulary in their individual science notebooks to help them process the content. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical Practice/Comparison Group (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The science curriculum in the comparison classrooms is district-developed and aligned to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;field notes from classroom observations were also collected from both treatment and control classrooms to monitor teaching behavior. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;treatment teachers were able to effectively implement strategies (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a positive effect of training workshops was evident because treat- ment teachers were making full use (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;treatment teachers from our bi-monthly meetings also reported that they have benefited from professional workshops (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measure (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the effect of this literacy-integrated science intervention, we used both standardized tests and district-developed tests in science and English language and lit- eracy, reflecting a multilevel, multifaceted assessment framework as suggested by Ruiz-Primo, Shavelson, Hamilton, and Klein (2002) in the assessment of science. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State-standardized test: Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills. The Texas Assess- ment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) is a state-standardized criterion-referenced assessment (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District benchmark tests. Similar to TAKS, the district-developed benchmark test is also a criterion-referenced test to determine students’ performance in passing (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Indicators of Basic Literacy Skills. Dynamic Indicators of Basic Literacy Skills (DIBELS) (Good &amp;amp; Kaminski, 2002) measures early literacy skills from kinder- garten through sixth grade. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Sources and Analysis (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment effects were tested for vocabulary, fluency, and academic achievement in reading and science, respectively. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ORF administered at the pre-test and post-test, analysis of covariance was used with the analogous pre-test serving as the covariate. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For measures for which the outcome variable is dichotomous, e.g. pass or fail in benchmark tests and TAKS tests, multilevel logistic analysis was performed to compare the odds ratio on these respective measures. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the sample size of this study, cross- level interaction was not modeled, and the treatment effect was tested at the level of rotation/section. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;possible dependency of students (level 1) within rotations (level 2) and within school (level 3) (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher was not included as a higher level because there were relatively small numbers of teachers in each school (close to three teachers per school, see Table 1), and school was the unit of randomization. Furthermore, adding both teacher and school levels to the model could have resulted in computational difficulty and a poten- tial non-convergence issue (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the combined model follows: (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All models were fit in HLM 6.08 (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science Benchmark Tests (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first research question of this study was, Do students’ performance differ on the dis- trict science benchmark tests by ethnicity (i.e. African-American vs. Hispanic), gender (male vs. female), and participation in the literacy-embedded science intervention (i.e. treatment condition vs. comparison condition)? To respond to this research question, multilevel logistic analysis was conducted. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the stan- dard critical value of alpha ¼ 0.05 that is typical in educational research, the results in Tests 3 and 4 are considered statistically non-significant. However, given the limited literature, it is worthy of noting and future research (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the treatment – gender – ethnicity difference was observed in the rate of commended performance in Test 4, with the coefficients of treatment, Female, and African-American estimated as significant with 1.23 (condition), 2 0.45 (gender), and 2 0.75 (ethnicity) (ps , .05), respectively, (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science TAKS Test (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second research question of this study was, Do students’ performance differ on the state-standardized science test by ethnicity, gender, and participation in the literacy-embedded science intervention? To respond to this research question, multilevel logistic analysis was conducted. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a marginally significant treat- ment effect (p ¼ .09), indicating that treatment students were 2.80 times (e1.03 ) more likely of passing the science TAKS test than their control peers. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading Achievement (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third research question of this study was, Do students’ performance differ on the dis- trict reading benchmark tests and state-standardized reading test by ethnicity, gender, and participation in the literacy-embedded science intervention? (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading benchmark tests. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;results indicated significant difference in Tests 2 and 4 in the rate of passing. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading TAKS test. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;significant and negative ( r ¼ 2 1.12, p ¼ 0.001) in the rate of passing, corresponding to a higher chance of passing reading TAKS, i.e. 3.06 times more (e1.71 /e1.712 1.12 ) for Hispanic students than for African-American students across conditions and gender. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oral Reading Fluency (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth research question of this study was, Do students’ performance differ on English ORF by ethnicity, gender, and participation in the literacy-embedded science inter- vention? (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he coefficients of treat- ment, ethnicity, and pre-test were estimated to be statistically significant (ps , .01), indicating that controlling for pre-test scores, Hispanic male students in the treatment condition demonstrated 7.85 points higher than did their control peers, and Hispanic students scored 3.98 points higher than did African-American students on the ORF post-test. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion and Recommendations (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using multilevel modeling techniques, we compared students’ performance by condition, gender, and ethnicity on academic achievement in reading and science and English reading fluency. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, results suggest a positive treatment effect in the district-wide benchmark tests and the state-standardized test in science. More specifically, students who received the literacy-integrated science intervention were more likely than were the students in the typical practice (control) classrooms to pass the science benchmark tests (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to science achievement, we observed that treatment students also devel- oped faster in ORF. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gender difference was found to be significant with male students demonstrating higher academic achievement in science than did female students. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also found that African-American students had a lower chance of sufficiently mastering the science concepts and of achieving above the state standards when com- pared with Hispanic students between genders and across conditions. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also legitimate to state that positive student outcomes are attributable to the bi- monthly professional development on reading/literacy-integrated, inquiry-based instruction with structured, standards-aligned lesson plans. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significance, Implication, and Conclusions (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;opportunity for African-American and Hispanic students from low-income families to acquire more science knowledge and skills so as to potentially remove initial differences when they mature to eighth grade to compete with their middle-class White peers. (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second significance of our study is that our findings confirmed the positive effect of the literacy-integrated science intervention with English learners from the same larger research project (Author, 2012). (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implications related to professional development for teachers who teach low-SES students are for school administrators: (a) achieving similar outcomes on similar cam- puses, as reported in our study, requires administrators to provide a substantial amount of time and resource commitment for the teachers and (b) administrators should consider at least four hours of release time per month for teachers to develop skills outlined in our study that promote student learning in science and reading literacy.

Retrieved from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume14/Tutzauer.pdf&#34;&gt;https://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume14/Tutzauer.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This paper introduces &lt;em&gt;affiliation index&lt;/em&gt;, a new measure to characterize affiliation in a two-mode network. As the author nicely argues, this index is two-mode in nature, compared to centrality measures which are one-mode in nature and often borrowed to analyze two-mode networks. The author also introduces a family of affiliation indices and significance tests based on its binomial distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: It is rather shocking that in a 2013 paper, we are still taking about such a simple two-mode network measure. This is not saying the paper is not good, but to say work on two-mode network analysis is surprisingly thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this family of measures directly applicable in my research settings. Maybe someone already implemented them in some tools. Will find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article introduces a family of affiliation measures that captures the extent of actors‘ affiliations in the network. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-mode networks, in which the nodes of a network are partitioned into two groups, or modes, have received increasing attention in the social network literature (e.g., Latapy, Magnien and Del Vecchio 2008; Wang, Sharpe, Robins and Pattison 2009). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affiliation networks have been used to study subjects as diverse as interlocking corporate directorates (Koenig, Gogel and Sonquist 1979), community organizations (Crowe 2007), director affiliation through both corporate and noncorporate organizations (Barnes and Burkett 2010), academic collaboration (Moody 2004), political communication (Chung and Park 2010; Park and Thelwall 2008), human language (Ferrer i Cancho and Solé 2001; Zhou and Heineken 2009), computer- mediated communication (Cho and Lee 2008), and the disciplinary structure of academic organizations (Barnett and Danowski 1992; Chung, Lee, Barnett and Kim 2009; Doerfel and Barnett 1999; Lee 2008). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because certain edges are prohibited (namely edges between actors and edges between events), affiliation networks present certain problems (and opportunities) when one attempts to apply standard network measures (Borgatti and Everett 1997). This article develops a family of affiliation indices specifically for two-mode networks that are represented by bipartite graphs. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematical Preliminaries (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The networks in this article are loopless and undirected. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Should We Measure Affiliation? (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The affiliation index of an actor should measure the extent to which the actor is fully integrated into the structure of the affiliation network—how enmeshed the actor is, by virtue of the actor‘s shared events, relative to other actors. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affiliation index (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypergraph also shows that the degree of an actor does not necessarily correspond to how affiliated the actor is with other actors. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which one might assess an actor‘s affiliation using shared events. Their number, size, and multiplicity could be taken into account. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we define actor v i‘s affiliation index, symbolized α(v i), by the equation: )( )(μ )( ii i vd v v  . (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a measure of affiliation, α is not perfect. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, one disadvantage of the measure is that it is somewhat ―coarse.‖ (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the present measure depends primarily on only an actor‘s maximum mutual affiliation without taking into account other mutual affiliations, actors D and F receive the same scores with the present measure whereas a finer-grained measure might distinguish between them. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above analysis suggests that we might consider the present measure merely the first in a family of measures, what we might call the first-order affiliation index and symbolize α 1. If we let μ i be the ith largest mutual affiliation an actor has, then we would rewrite Equation 1 as α 1= μ 1/ d (if the actor is understood). Moreover, a reasonable second-order affiliation index would be α 2 = (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)[(μ 1 + μ 2)/d]. In general, for k = 1, &amp;hellip; , n – 1 we define the kth-order affiliation index for an actor to be the sum of the actor‘s k largest mutual affiliations all divided by kd (dividing by k normalizes the measure to a 0-1 scale). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, it is probably not necessary to compute affiliation indices of all orders. In fact, first-order affiliation may be sufficient in many applications. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sampling Distribution of First-Order Affiliation (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical Model (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the assumption that the elements of the affiliation matrix are generated independently, many of the variables of interest will have a binomial distribution. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derivation of the Distribution (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Empirical Example (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we apply the first-order affiliation index and its sampling distribution to an empirical, two-mode network. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the affiliation matrix of 20 corporate directors (the actors) and their memberships in social clubs and various corporate, museum, and university boards of directors or trustees (the events), as reported by Barnes and Burkett (2010). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the diagonal of Table 5, we see that the directors attended anywhere from a low of two events (Chewning and Cushman) to a high of nine events (Livingston and Oates). But attending many events does not mean that these events are shared with another actor. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Equations 14 and 15 to compute significance levels, one finds that none of the actors are significantly less affiliated than expected by chance. Five actors, however, are significantly more affiliated than expected by chance (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note importantly that, as in the hypothetical network of the previous section, having a high degree does not necessarily mean that the actor will be highly affiliated in the network. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the first-order affiliation scores fail to match the degree centralities as well as the other three centrality measures. In fact, as Table 7 shows, first-order affiliation is actually negatively correlated with the centrality measures for this network, a possibility remarked upon previously, and one that demonstrates that centrality and affiliation are quite different ideas. Whereas central actors may attend many events, or be between or close to other actors and events, affiliation specifically takes into account the nature of the shared events that actors have. Measuring affiliation is thus a purely two-mode idea. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article has introduced a family of affiliation indices for two-mode networks having a bipartite representation. One of these indices—first-order affiliation, which is based on the largest proportion of events that an actor has in common with another actor in the network—was examined for its sampling characteristics. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affiliation networks have wide applications in the social sciences, and, because of their special structure relative to traditional, one-mode networks, new tools and measures can fruitfully be developed—tools and measures that take advantage of two-mode information. Of particular interest is the way that actors are affiliated with other actors by virtue of their mutual attendance at events. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper builds on the 2003 paper, further explaining how CORDTRA diagrams help us interpret learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found very useful in this paper in particular is the coding schemes they used to analyze collaborative learning. The coding scheme of &amp;ldquo;complexity&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;monitoring&amp;rdquo; could be especially useful for me to analyze use of promisingness tool by students.&lt;/p&gt;

We frame our work in sociocultural and social constructivist theories which (1) argue
that learning is inherently social and situated (Palincsar 1998) and (2) emphasize the
critical role of tools in mediating learning (Cole 1996).&lt;/p&gt;

We view the learning environment as an activity system (Engestro¨m 1999). In under-
standing this system, we need to investigate the cultural tools that are used—the language
used in discourse and the computer technology that embodies a particular pedagogical
model.&lt;/p&gt;

 Other approaches to
analyzing CSCL data include experimental methods (e.g., Rummel and Spada 2005; Su-
thers and Hundhausen 2003), multilevel analysis (Cress 2008; Janssen et al. 2007) and
social network analysis (e.g., Nurmela et al. 1999). Finally, others have used interaction
analysis (Jordan and Henderson 1995; Hmelo-Silver et al. 2007b; Lantz-Andersson et al. in
press) and conversation analysis (e.g., Stahl 2006a, b).&lt;/p&gt;

Some researchers have integrated time into their analyses in a variety of ways. De Laat
and Lally (2003) examined how discourse changed over time in an online discussion using
a combination of critical event recall and content analysis over different discrete phases of
an online discussion. Zemel et al. (2007), developed an emergent coding scheme based on
critical events as they unfolded during sequential online chats. Using multivariate statistics
and chronologically oriented sequences to visualize the data, these individuals were able to
draw conclusions about group interactions. Schu¨mmer et al. (2005) combined discourse
with log data. In their paper, however, they addressed the difﬁculty of representing these
data for analysis. Luckin et al. (2001) and Luckin (2003) presented a means to visualize
their data through CORDFU (Chronologically-Ordered Representation of Discourse and
Features Used).&lt;/p&gt;

Other researchers have developed
analytic tools that focus on how a concrete artifact is constructed. In particular, Avouris

work backward from a collaboratively created diagrammatic artifact and study the history
that led to the construction of that artifact.&lt;/p&gt;

One point distinguishing the two groups from the outset is how the groups engaged the
facilitator (a TA) and the course instructor (CHS, who also helped facilitate). In Group 1,
the facilitators were involved early and fairly frequently, and asked most of the explanatory
and metacognitive questions.&lt;/p&gt;

CORDTRA diagrams also allow zooming in and out on different parts of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;

 In contrast, Group 2 asked many questions and used all the
resources available to help with the development of their instructional plan.&lt;/p&gt;

This can also help both the facilitators and researchers to focus on the
appropriate parts of the activity that need to be improved either while teaching or during
the post-teaching analyses. Being able to actually accomplish this would require auto-
mating construction of CORDTRA diagrams so that they can be available in a timely
fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebben, M. and Murphy, J. S. (2014). Unpacking mooc scholarly discourse: a review of nascent mooc scholarship. Learning, Media and Technology, 39(3):328–345.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review of MOOC research is useful for someone who is new to the topic (and its history). Based on a review of about two dozen journal articles, the authors identified two phases of MOOC scholarly discourse, characterizing each phase by their key ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly speaking, I have expected more from this article. The identification of these two phases didn&amp;rsquo;t stretch too far from the distinction already made between cMOOC and xMOOC. Also, excluding conference proceedings could be a serious mistake for this review because a lot of good stuff has not made to journal articles yet, and they are not necessarily of less quality..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key phases of scholarship about MOOCs are identified, each with associated research imperatives and themes. Phase One: Connectivist MOOCs, Engagement and Creativity 2009 – 2011/ 2012. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase Two: xMOOCs, Learning Analytics, Assessment, and Critical Discourses about MOOCs 2012–2013. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper identifies a solid body of empirically based MOOC research and analyses this area of inquiry, its authors, content, and direction. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cite&lt;br /&gt;
 Just a side note: The paper should cite the original distinction between cMoocs and xMoocs. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data collection (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles for analysis were drawn from a comprehensive search of nine leading academic databases starting in the year 2002 to 1 July 2013. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The databases searched were: Academic Search Complete, Communication and Mass Media Complete, Directory of Open Access Journals, Education Full Text, ERIC, Google Scholar, MathSciNet, Science Direct, and Web of Science. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data collection efforts yielded 25 scholarly articles with a research focus on MOOCs published between 2009 and 2013. One article was published in 2009, no articles were published in 2010, 10 articles were published in 2011 and 2012, and 14 articles (59% of the total) were published in the first half of 2013 (Table 1). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research methodologies used were diverse, employing both qualitative and quantitative approaches such as content analysis, surveys, interviews, self-reflection, data-mining techniques applied to MOOC courses, and social network analyses of MOOC participants’ interactions and patterns of communication. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars are beginning to formulate conceptual frameworks to organize the nascent research literature about MOOCs. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liyanagunawardena, Adams, and Williams (2013) identify eight themes apparent in MOOC scholarship. These include: (1) Introductory (explaining aspects of MOOCs), (2) Concept (discussion of threats and opportunities of MOOCs in higher education), (3) Case Studies, (4) Educational theory (pedagogical approaches used), (5) Technology (discussion of hardware and software used), (6) Participant focused ((discussion of participants’ experiences), (7) Provider focused (discussion of course creators and leaders), and (8) Other. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key phases of MOOC scholarship are identified, each with associated themes. Phase One: Connectivist cMOOCs, Engagement and Creativity 2009–2011/2012. Themes of Phase One include: development of Connectivism as a learning theory, and technological experimentation and innovation with Connectivism in early cMOOCs. Phase Two: xMOOCs, Learning Analytics and Assessment 2012–2013. Themes of Phase Two include: the rise of xMOOCs, further development of MOOC pedagogy, growth of learning analytics and assessment, and the emergence of a critical discourse about MOOCs. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase one: Connectivist cMOOCs, engagement and creativity 2009–2012 (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early MOOC researchers sought to operationalize the learning theory of Connectivism by building and running cMOOCs with a few researchers (Kop 2011; DeWaard et al. 2011) doubling as both designers and facilitators of the MOOCs under study. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the cMOOCs described in the research of this period were affiliated with Canadian distance education university programs. These include: PLENK 2010 (Personal Learning Environments, Networks and Knowledge,) CCK 08, 09, 11 (Connectivism and Connective Knowledge), CRITLIT 2010 (Critical Literacies), and MobiMOOC 2011. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participant interaction and modular roles for educators and participants within an open network were emphasized in these early cMOOCs. None of the four cMOOCs analyzed in the research, however, had the goal of delivering standard university course content (e.g., Math 101). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the majority of the 1580 participants in this cMOOC were disengaged, a core group of participants, mostly educators, were highly engaged and reported that the reasons for their engagement as producers of digital content were due to motivation and social support. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little critique of the limits of Connectivism in this first phase of MOOC research; however, Bell (2011) is the exception. He does not believe Connectivism can always be applied successfully to online teaching, and suggests that Connectivism fits some learning environments better than others. Bell rejects Connectivism as a theory, and argues that it is best understood as a phenomenon rather than as a full-fledged theory of learning. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase two: xMOOCs, learning analytics, assessment, and critical discourse 2012–2013 (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this analysis of differences, as well as drawing on the classifications proposed by Anderson and Dron (2011), Rodriguez argues that the Stanford MOOC is a different sort of massive online course, an xMOOC. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an epistemological point of view, Rodriguez argues that cMOOCs are characterized by generative knowledge, whereas xMOOCs are characterized by declarative knowledge. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept and practice of ‘openness’ in MOOCS also gets differentiated between the two MOOC formats by Rodriguez (2013). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For xMOOCs, openness means open access to anyone. For cMOOCs, openness in a connected environment constitutes the locus and practice of knowledge acquisition and production. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New note&lt;br /&gt;
 I would say &amp;lsquo;learning analytics&amp;rsquo; discussed in this article represents a narrow conception of this topic. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictive algorithms and adaptive feedback mechanisms hardwired into MOOCs track, record, and analyze every click a student makes to generate data aimed at understanding the ways in which students learn in MOOCs (McKay 2013). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aim of learning analytics is to correlate student characteristics (age, gender, nationality, etc.) with achievement in MOOC courses. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning analytics research also focuses on discerning micro-patterns of behavior about the ways in which students use course materials available in MOOCs. For example, analyses track the time students spend watching lecture videos, doing homework, completing labs, engaging in discussion boards, consulting the textbook, and other course resources. The concept is to identify high-performing students and map their activities and behaviors in the MOOC to determine the best presentation sequence of course materials. Researchers seek to identify when certain resources might be most useful and in what ways. For example, what resources do the best MOOC students use for different tasks? What behaviors do they perform when preparing for an exam? What behaviors do they engage in when working on homework? Learning analytics compares discussion board behavior of high achieving students with others. Who asked questions? Who answered questions or made a comment? Does discussion board communication correlate with course success? (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘best’ is operationalized as learning, growth, and persistence. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Breslow et al. (2013), the next phase of data-mining research will focus on further development of models and analytics to offer understanding about the ways in which student background and other patterns of student engagement with course content either assist or hinder students’ ability to persist and complete the course, including attempting to understand the high dropout rates of MOOCs.3 (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enrich the pedagogical repertoire, student writing is attempted in some MOOCs, but assessment remains an obstacle. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two forms of essay assessment are currently described in research on MOOCs: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) software used by edX, and University of California – Los Angeles Calibrated Peer ReviewTM (CPR) used by Coursera. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical discourse about MOOCs (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critiques of MOOCs are being articulated that identify problematics related to MOOC epistemology, pedagogy, and cultural hegemony (Rhoads et al. 2013). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the problem of epistemology concerns the narrow view of knowledge employed in some MOOCs that view knowledge as a product to be transmitted to anyone with an internet connection and a computer (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of pedagogy refers to a limited understanding of what constitutes empowering teaching. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another article (Wolfe et al., 1998/this issue) we showed how Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) can be used to assess student knowledge—how essays can be graded by LSA and how LSA can match students with appropriate instructional texts. We did this by comparing an essay written by a student with one or more target instructional texts in terms of the cosine between the vector representation of the student&amp;rsquo;s essay and the instructional text in question. This simple method was effective for the purpose, but questions remain about how LSA achieves its results and how the results might be improved. Here, we address four such questions: (a) What role does the use of technical vocabulary play? (b) how long should the student essays be? &amp;copy; is the cosine the optimal measure of semantic relatedness? and (d) how does one deal with the directionality of knowledge in the high-dimensional space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief commentary on the use of social media (esp. ResearchGate) by academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ijad Madisch, a Berlin-based former physician and virologist, tells this story as just one example of the successes of ResearchGate, which he founded with two friends six years ago. (p. 126)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of failed efforts to launch a ‘Facebook for science’ included Scientist Solutions, SciLinks, Epernicus, 2collab and Nature Network (run by the company that publishes Nature). (p. 126)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to get past the hype and explore what is really happening, Nature e-mailed tens of thousands of researchers in May to ask how they use social networks and other popular profile-hosting or search services, and received more than 3,500 responses from 95 different countries. (p. 126)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 88% of scientists and engineers said that they were aware of it — slightly more than had heard of Google+ and Twitter — with little difference between countries. (p. 127)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the apparent profiles on the site are not owned by real people, but are created automatically — and incompletely — by scraping details of people’s affiliations, publication records and PDFs, if available, from around the web. That annoys researchers who do not want to be on the site, and who feel that the pages misrepresent them (p. 127)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that Facebook is not widely used professionally; that researchers on Twitter are very active and social; and that many users of Academia.edu and ResearchGate signed up in case someone wants to contact them — but are not chatty themselves. (p. 128)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the European Commission last year found that 18% of biology papers published in 2008– 11 were open access from the start, and said that 57% could be read for free in some form, somewhere on the Internet, by April 2013 (see Nature 500, 386–387; 2013). (p. 128)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I hardly know any scientists who don’t violate copyright laws. We just fly below the radar and hope that the publishers don’t notice.” (p. 128)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are nice-to-have tools, not need-to-have,” says Auclair. But Price says that the networks are on the front line of a trend that cannot be ignored. “We saw the changes in the market, and we could see that academics wanted to share openly. The tide is starting to turn in our direction.” (p. 129)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;social interactions generally imply better score for students engaging in them. We find that thesestudents, which is created during the first weeks of the course. Low performing students try to engage in theclub after it has been initially formed, and fail to produce reciprocity in their interactions, displaying more (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;analysis has mainly tried to determine static structural features of the social learning network formed by the (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the relevance of the social network structure and interactions has been widely recognised in theeducational context 10ingness to communicate 11. In general, it is not just about knowing ‘‘who’’ the students interact with, but ‘‘how’’and ‘‘when’’ they do it and, importantly, what is the result of these interactions with regards to the educational12 (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NA (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquiring full knowledge on ‘‘how’’ students interact would befacilitated by having access to dynam ic interactions and their changes (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity and assortativity analysis . Our first finding is that, in thisenvironment, social diversity is negatively correlated with (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We analysed a record of college student interactions and compared (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 | Diversity and Assortativity Analysis. (A) shows a graph of one of the analysed courses including 82 students at the end of the last week of thecourse. Continuous thick blue edges indicate persistent interactions while dotted thin grey edges indicate transient interactions. High performi ngstudents are shown in dark blue, mid performing ones in red and low performing ones in green. As can be observed, high performance students form a‘‘core’’ where the highest density of persistent interactions can be observed. Low performance students remain in the periphery of the graph, mainlyholding transient interactions. (B) Scatter plot and linear regression for one of the variables analysed (number of interactions) vs. scoring in one of theclasses (R2 5 0.72). &amp;copy; Scatter plot and linear regression for social diversity vs. scoring in one of the classes ( R2 5 0.12). (D): Ratio of transient to persistentinteractions obtained for different groups of students with different levels of interaction (LOW, MID, HIGH). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;group) per week and per student group (low, (B); mid, &amp;copy;; and high, (D)) relative to the total number of interactions per group per week. Continuouslines represent the fit of a curve to the points as indicated in Methods. As can be observed, the % of persistent interaction increases as the course prog ressesfor all groups of students. High performing students achieved a higher % of persistent interactions than mid and low performing ones. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NA (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, social diversity is defined as Shannon’s entropy associated with individual communication behaviour, normalised to the total number of interactions (see Methods in SI for more details). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, low performance students tend to initiate many transientinteractions regardless of the performance of the students theyinteract with. These interactions held by low performance studentsstart late in the course, allowing high performers to establish a closelyknitted group. In the following, we give details of these findings. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of connections (students that a student has interactedwith) and number of interactions (times a student has contacted orbeen contacted with/by other students), (see Methods in SI) were allpositively correlated with the final score of the student (Pearson’scorrelations of 0.81, 0.85, respectively; p , (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NA (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;established persistent interactions before mid and low performance (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further analyse the effects on score, students were grouped intohigh (. 6.5), mid (between 6.5 and 3.5) and low (, 3.5) scoring(scores in Spain are typically given in a 0–10 scale, being 10 the topscore). To verify the suggested existence of less effective interactions, (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we also classified the type of interactions in two types: 1) persistent,those sustained over time, and 2) transient, those not reciprocated (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vague; are they truly opposite? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;actions together with the assortativity analysis (students preferred tosuggested that at some point reciprocity R i,j (measured as the fractionof times a student i in any given group responds to a student j outsideof times a student i in any given group responds to a student j outsideher same group) should start to drop. However, reciprocity remainedher same group) should start to drop. However, reciprocity remainedunchanged with time and was similar between groups ( ^0: (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lysis17 on these persistent interactions with regards to score indicatedthe existence of preferential interaction initiation (r 5 0.5, p , 0.05by using the Jackknife method, see Methods in SI). In other words,similarly scoring students tended to keep persistent interactions only (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;groups are highly symmetric (having almost even initiations startingfrom both ends). On the contrary, transient interactions betweendent with lower performance (with 0.87 probability). In addition, thetiming of responses was different. While persistent interactions areresponded in 8.1 6 0.3 hours on average, the response time fortransient interactions is delayed 7.21 6 0.46 days. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assortative behaviour with regards to scoring is highly suggestive of a ‘‘rich club’’ phenomenon (see Methods in SI and 18,19). A‘‘rich club’’ is defined as a set of nodes with degree larger than k thattend to be more densely connected among themselves than the nodeswith degree smaller than k (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all the types of interaction into account, we could observe no ‘‘richclub’’ effect (w rðÞ^3 for the students with more links, indicating theyalso interacted with students outside the ‘‘rich club’’). However,when only persistent interactions were taken into account, weobtained w rðÞ^1, which is in line with the idea of high scoringstudents keeping persistent interactions between themselves as indicated by our assortativity analysis. The ‘‘rich club’’ phenomenoncould not be observed during the first weeks, w(r ) =apparent only after week 4–5 for the top performing students,apparent only after week 4–5 for the top performing students,remaining stable afterwards.

&lt;p&gt;Information cascades . Information cascades reveal spreadmechanisms in which an action or idea becomes adopted due tothe influence of others, typically, neighbours in some network. Awell-known example are cascades in the context of large productrecommendation networks 21–24. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temporal analysis . One interesting finding is that the total numberof interactions per week (normalised to the maximum value in allweeks) for all groups increased over time and it saturated aroundweek 6 for mid performing students and around week 4 for high (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to analyse another source of information: file exchange of students in (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NA (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We defined as trivial cascades those implying a single transfer (asingle originating source and a single destination) of informationabout the course, and non-trivial cascades, those with more complexpatterns. We found a total of 845 cascades, and 53.37% of which were trivial cascades (T1 in Figure 4), 25% were non-trivial cascades involally more complex. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total number of cascades was significantly different across allthree groups 51%, 35.97% and 13.03% for high, mid and low performance students, respectively (see Table 1). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chronous transfers) gradually increased as the average score of thestudents involved in the cascade increased. This is also supported bythe fact that among non trivial cascades, the most common patternfor low performance students was star-like (T2 and T397.8%), while chained cascades (T4, T5 and T6 in Figure 4) weremore common for mid (53.82%) and high (76.29%) performingstudents. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major finding is that a higher number of online interactions(independently of the number of distinct students involved) is usually an indicator of higher score. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results also show that the higher the score of the students, the (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Information for: The rich-club phenomenon in the classroom (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interaction Classification An interaction between students i and j was classified as persistent if the contact occurred at least twice per week. This definition tries to convey the importance of reciprocity as an indicator of mutual interest and value extracted from the interaction. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grouping Metrics The correlations between properties of adjacent network nodes are known in the ecology and epidemiology literature as “assortative mixing”. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rich club” Connectivity Following [2, 3], students were sorted by decreasing number of links (connections). The node rank r denotes the position of a node on this ordered list. The “rich club” was defined, for the purpose of this study, as nodes with rank less than r max (e.g. 7 %). The “rich club” connectivity (r ) is defined as the ratio of the total actual number of links to the maximum possible number of links between members of the top scoring “rich club”. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veletsianos, G., &amp;amp; Shepherdson, P. (2015). Who studies MOOCs? Interdisciplinarity in MOOC research and its changes over time. The International Review of Research in. Retrieved from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2202&#34;&gt;http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2202&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This study builds on earlier studies of the MOOC literature, but with a special focus (on interdisciplnarity) and a different approach. Briefly, it studies the scope of the literature from 2013-2015; it uses author affiliation as a proxy for Interdisciplinarity; it covers a broad range of literature extracted from multiple indices; it relies on descriptive and inferential statistics (Chi-square) to describe interdisciplinarityand compare it with data from earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assess&lt;/em&gt;: A well-planned study and a well-crafted paper overall. Also, sincere explanation of the limitations with the study. The treatment of interdisciplnarity in this context is convincing even though I had doubts when diving into this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflect&lt;/em&gt;: This paper builds upon earlier ones and points to interesting future directions to be explored. Compared to Gasevic et al. (2014), which uses a different dataset and very different analytic approaches, this study&amp;rsquo;s techniques are relatively simple, but to the point. Future directions could follow deepening the analysis conducted here, by, for instance, using citation data (bibio coupling); or by mashing-up with other data sources, such as Twitter data at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We apply descriptive and inferential statistics to bibliometric data to investigate interdisciplinarity in MOOC research. Results show that MOOC research published in 2013-2015 was (a) mostly conducted by researchers affiliated with Education and Computer Science disciplines, (b) far from monolithic, &amp;copy; had a greater representation of authors from Computer Science than in the past, and (d) showed a trend toward being more interdisciplinary than MOOC research published in 2008-2012. Our results also suggest that empirical research on xMOOCs may be more interdisciplinary than research on cMOOCs. Greater interdisciplinarity in xMOOC research could reflect the burgeoning interest in the field, the general familiarity with the xMOOC pedagogical model, and the hype experienced by xMOOCs. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes great sense. Also start wondering whether we have to promote interdisciplinarity at all, regardless its &amp;ldquo;benefits.&amp;rdquo; (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in their assessment of proposals submitted for funding under the MOOC research initiative (henceforth MRI), Gašević, Kovanović, Joksimović, and Siemens (2014) show that more than 50% of the authors in all phases of the MRI grants were from the field of education, even though a common perception in the field is that the MOOC phenomenon is “driven by computer scientists” (p. 166). Research into emerging forms of digital learning is likely to suffer if driven by education researchers alone or computer scientists alone. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have recently completed a systematic review of the empirical MOOC literature published between 2013 and 2015 (Veletsianos &amp;amp; Shepherdson, 2015), and as a result of that study, we can use bibliometric data to investigate the extent to which interdisciplinarity is present in the published literature on MOOCs. Thus, in this paper, we combine our data with data from Gašević et al. (2014), and data used in a past systematic review of the literature ( Liyanagunawardena, Adams, &amp;amp; Williams, 2013), to examine interdisciplinarity in the MOOC literature, and whether and how this has changed over time. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literature Review (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interdisciplinary research is “any study or group of studies undertaken by scholars from two or more distinct scientific disciplines” (Aboelela et al., 2007, p. 341). The value of interdisciplinary research and collaboration rests in both the complexity of the problems societies are faced with (Pellmar &amp;amp; Eisenberg, 2000), and in the novel perspectives that academic “immigrants” can bring to a field other than their own (Nissani, 1997). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research investigating interdisciplinarity has explored its utility in academic, educational, and practical contexts (Choi &amp;amp; Pak, 2006), factors mitigating against its occurrence (Bauer, 1990), and whether indications of its presence actually reflect cross-pollination between different disciplines (Schummer, 2004). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huang and Chang (2011) demonstrated that research in Information Science has become increasingly interdisciplinary over the course of three decades. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he scientific complexity facing research into digital and online education is increasingly expanding. This is evident in the context of research into MOOCs and networked learning/participation. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zuckerman, Azari, and Doane, (2013, p. 17) for instance argue that the learning sciences and learning technology communities are at the cusp of catalyzing potentially transformative change in post-secondary education&amp;hellip;At the same time, there are many unknowns regarding the fundamental science of learning, the translation of those fundamental ideas into curriculum design (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eisenhart and DeHaan (2005) proposed that doctoral preparation programs for education researchers include interdisciplinary collaborations as one of their core components, and the scientific community has responded to the scientific complexity of digital education in part by developing the field of learning analytics, which Gašević, Dawson, and Siemens (2015, p. 64) describe as a “bricolage field drawing on research, methods, and techniques from numerous disciplines such as learning sciences, data mining, information visualization, and psychology.” (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we have been able to identify some papers encouraging researchers to cross disciplinary lines to investigate digital education (e.g., Alavi &amp;amp; Leidner, 2001), studies exploring the degree to which digital education research in general, and MOOC research in particular, is interdisciplinary, are scant. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one study that we have i dentified that examined multidisciplinarity in the MOOC context was the analysis of funding submissions to the MOOC research initiative (MRI) by Gašević et al. (2014). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given that their analysis focused solely on submissions seeking funding from a specific source, the extent to which this is reflective of MOOC research more broadly is unclear. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not directly bearing upon the topic of interdisciplinarity in MOOC research, a study by Kirby, Hoadley, and Carr-Chellman (2005) is also informative. These authors were interested in understanding the relationships between the Instructional Systems Design and Learning Sciences fields - two fields of study interested in the use of technology for learning - and conducted a citation analysis to identify these relationships. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a bibliometric app roach does allow us to describe the interdisciplinary nature of MOOC research as regards Aboelela et al.’s (2007) definition of the term: studies undertaken by scholars from different disciplines. Specifically, using the papers collected for a systematic review of the literature reported in Veletsianos and Shepherdson (2015) provides an opportunity to assess the disciplinary distribution of authors conducting recent research into MOOCs. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Questions (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ 1: What are the disciplinary backgrounds of the authors who published empirical MOOC research in 2013-2015? RQ 2: How does the disciplinary distribution of the authors who published MOOC research in 2013-2015 compare to that of the submissions to the MRI reported by Gašević et al. (2014)? RQ 3: Is the 2013-2015 empirical research on MOOCs more or less interdisciplinary than was previously the case? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an exhaustive description of the methodology used to systematically gather empirical literature on MOOCs is presented by Veletsianos and Shepherdson (2015) (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discover empirical MOOC literature we conducted searches using the key words “MOOC” or “Massive Open Online Course” and limited our results to 2013-2015. These searches occurred between January 7, 2015 and February 1, 2015. Our inclusion criteria were the following: To be included, the identified document ought to focus on MOOCs and ought to have been ( 1) empirical, (2) published in a peer-reviewed journal, in conference proceedings, or in Educause Review, (3) published or was available online as in press between January 2013 and January 2015, and (4) written in English. Three researchers were involved in this process and they read each abstract to identify papers for inclusion. If no decision could be made by examining the abstract, the complete paper was downloaded and examined. The databases, search engines and journals used in this search were the following: Scopus, Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, Summon, Google Scholar, EdITLib Digital Library, and Educause Library. The Journal of Online (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning and Teaching was searched because it was not indexed by Scopus, and because it was also examined by Liyanagunawardena et al. (2013) in their own systematic review of the MOOC literature. 120 empirical papers that fit the inclusion criteria were identified via these search strategies. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, a forward referencing search strategy and a reference list search strategy were also used to discover more literature. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Collection (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•Names and affiliations of each author (n=462) who had contributed to at least one paper in the corpus consisting of empirical MOOC research published in 2013-2015; •Affiliation data reported by Gašević et al., (2014) (n=429); and •Names and affiliations of each author (n=56) who had contributed to at least one paper in the corpus identified by Liyanagunawardena et al. (2013). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Analysis (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ 1: What are the disciplinary backgrounds of the authors who published empirical MOOC research in 2013-2015? After collation of author affiliation information was complete, two independent raters allocated each affiliation to one of a list of 12 disciplinary categories we devised during the collation process. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ 2: How does the disciplinary distribution of the authors who published MOOC research in 2013-2015 compare to that of the submissions to the MRI reported by Gašević et al. (2014)? We used Gašević et al.’s reported disciplinary frequencies for the top five disciplines to which MRI submitters belonged, and compared these to the frequencies of the same disciplines in our corpus by way of a chi-square test. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ 3: Is the 2013-2015 empirical research on MOOCs more or less interdisciplinary than was previously the case? To determine changes in MOOC research interdisciplinarity, we first undertook the same affiliation categorisation process with the corpus of literature collected in a systematic review of MOOC literature from 2008–2012 by Liyanagunawardena et al. (2013) as we had undertaken with our corpus. We then used two statistical measures to assess differences between the corpora. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we used a chi-square test to compare the relative frequency of each discipline in the two corpora. Second, we used Brillouin’s index (Brillouin, 1956) to assess the overall interdisciplinarity of each corpus. This index is used as a measure of population diversity in the field of ecology (e.g., Peet, 1975), and has been used to assess interdisciplinarity in other research fields (e.g., Huang &amp;amp; Chang, 2011; Steele &amp;amp; Stier, 2000). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ 1: What are the disciplinary backgrounds of the authors who published empirical MOOC research in 2013-2015? (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequencies for each discipline in our corpus are displayed in Table 1. Education and Computer Science were the two most frequent affiliations, and between them accounted for over half of the authors. Industry, Social Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, and Administration each occurred in greater than 5% of the affiliations, with all remaining disciplines occurring with relatively less frequency. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the field appears to be far from monolithic. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ 2: How does the disciplinary distribution of the authors who published MOOC research in 2013-2015 compare to that of the submissions to the MRI reported by Gašević et al. (2014)? (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chi-square tests showed that our corpus and that of Gašević et al., (2014) differed significantly [X2(4,n = 781) = 39.57, p &amp;lt; .001 ], with standardised residuals indicating that our corpus had a greater representation of authors from Computer Science (standardised residual of 5.69), and the Gašević et al. corpus a greater representation of authors from Education and Industry (standardised residuals of 4.31 and 1.95, respectively). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RQ 3: Is the 2013-2015 empirical research on MOOCs more or less interdisciplinary than was previously the case? (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brillouin’s index indicated increased interdisciplinarity in our corpus (H B = 1.99 ) compared to that of Liyanagunawardena et al. (2013) (H B = 1.52). Results of the bootstrapping process showed a trend toward greater interdisciplinarity in our corpus (p = .095). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, future research could examine interdisciplinarity using alternative approaches. For instance, researchers could examine (a) the degree of interaction and awareness between the two disciplines by using methods similar to the ones used by Kirby, Hoadley, and Carr-Chellman (2005), or (b) the extent to which published research features interaction between the two fields not just in cross-citations of MOOC literature, but also in the ways that separate bodies of knowledge are integrated and combined in the design, analysis, and reporting of the research. Finally, future research could also examine whether fragmentation in the community is changing over time (e.g., by conducting the analysis described in a and b above for L@S 2014 and L@S 2015 and comparing the results). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A positive trend uncovered by our investigation is that research on MOOCs appears to be more interdisciplinary than in the past, suggesting that the scientific complexity of the field is being tackled by a greater diversity of researchers. This suggests that even though xMOOCs are often disparaged for their teacher-centric and cognitivist-behaviorist approach (Hew &amp;amp; Cheung, 2014; Kennedy, 2014), empirical research on xMOOCs may be more interdisciplinary than research on cMOOCs, which are deemed to embrace more progressive learning designs (Rodriguez, 2012). We make this statement on the basis of the fact that two distinct “phases” of the MOOC phenomenon appear to exist (cMOOC and xMOOC, as identified by Ebben and Murphy, 2014) and: (a) the Liyanagunawardena et al. (2013) corpus focused on cMOOCs, (b) the overwhelming majority of the studies included in our corpus focused on xMOOCs, and &amp;copy; our findings show that our corpus (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;was more interdisciplinary than that of Liyanagunawardena et al.2 Greater interdisciplinarity in the field represents a positive trend for digital education research. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, although our corpus had a greater representation of authors from Computer Science than was apparent in earlier MOOC research, our results may have been influenced by disciplinary norms in publishing. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the disciplinary makeup of our corpus may reflect differences in publication cycles between the publication outlets preferred by different disciplines. Unfortunately, the data we have gathered do not allow us to examine this insight empirically; nonetheless, this may be a worthwhile topic for future research. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limitations (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we used authors’ disciplinary affiliations as a proxy of their home discipline and we believe this to be a strong proxy, one limitation facing this study is the fact that authors may draw from a variety of disciplines in their research. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second limitation that readers need to be aware of reflects variations between the composition of our corpus (empirical papers) vis-a-vis Liyanagunawardena et al.’s (2013) corpus (papers that were both empirical and otherwise). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education and digital learning researchers may need to (a) take on a more active role in educating colleagues from other disciplines about what education researchers do and do not know about digital learning from the research that exists in the field and, (b) remain open to the perspectives that academic “immigrants” can bring to this field (cf. Nissani, 1997). At the same time, researchers from fields other than education need to recognize that education research and educational technology research have a long and rich history and an empirical basis that can inform design and research decisions. Working together, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and crossdisciplinary teams of researchers can improve our scholarly understanding of teaching and learning. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revisiting my question in the beginning of this article, I think authors have made a strong point for interdisciplinarity in MOOC research. Well done. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-introduction-p-1&#34;&gt;1. Introduction (p. 1)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current state of my search is one of some confusion. It has been di$cult to resolve a paradox in Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s work. On the one hand, Vygotsky often sounded like a behaviorist. On the other hand, Vygotsky often sounded like a constructivist. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-vygotsky-as-a-behaviorist-p-2&#34;&gt;2. Vygotsky as a behaviorist (p. 2)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1926, Vygotsky wrote a short course on Pedagogical Psychology in which he presented the idea, quoting Munsterberg, that `the pupil is a reacting apparatusa. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1930, just four years prior to his death, Vygotsky still presented the conditioned re#ex as a prime example of a psychological tool or instrument. He stated, `the whole composition of the instrumental act can, without exception, be reduced to a system of stimulusresponse connectionsa (Vygotsky, 1930b/1981, p. 140). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the individual, Vygotsky (1930a/1981) de&amp;rdquo;ned stages in terms of conditioned re#exes that are peculiar to particular individuals: `the conditioned re#ex is peculiar to only a particular individual not in accordance with nature or heredity, but as the acquired conditions of experiencea (pp. 173}174). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-vygotsky-as-a-constructivist-p-3&#34;&gt;3. Vygotsky as a constructivist (p. 3)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, challenged by those who read Vygotsky in Russian and who say he is a constructivist (for example, Bedrova, Valsiner, and Wertsch), I reread Vygotsky and concluded that Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s behaviorist statements should be interpreted in the context of his advocacy of more constructivist ideas. Evidence for Vygotsky as a constructivist comes principally from his theory of the dialectic. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-theoretical-similarities-between-vygotsky-and-piaget-p-4&#34;&gt;4. Theoretical similarities between Vygotsky and Piaget (p. 4)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1. Social factors play a central role in child development (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s position that social factors are central in development is well known. Piaget, however, is often misunderstood as viewing the child as a lonely scientist apart from the social context (e.g., Damon, 1981; Haste, 1987; Go$n, 1994; Lubeck, 1996; New, 1994; Santrock, 1997). It is true that his research focused mostly on individuals in a laboratory setting (the study of children&amp;rsquo;s marble play being an exception). However, it is important to distinguish between Piaget&amp;rsquo;s statements as an epistemologist and his statements as a psychologist. His main goal was epistemological } to explain how knowledge develops, not how the child develops. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he spoke (less frequently) as a child psychologist, Piaget emphasized the central role of social factors in the construction of knowledge. For example, even in his early work (Piaget, &lt;sup&gt;1928&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1995&lt;/sub&gt;), he sounded like Vygotsky when he said that &lt;code&gt;social life is a necessary condition for the development of logica (p. 120),&lt;/code&gt;social life transforms the very nature of the individuala (p. 210), and &lt;code&gt;that (the progress of) reason is due to social mechanismsa (p. 199). In later work, Piaget (1950/1995) stated that&lt;/code&gt;relations among individuals2modify the mental structures of individualsa (p. 40). Further, he unequivocally equated intellectual and social operations as identical (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore clear that Piaget and Vygotsky were in agreement that when one speaks of child development, one must give great attention to social factors. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2. Internalization is not a process of copying material from the environment but is a transformative process (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky emphasized internalization in development, but it is not easy from reading Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s works available in English to determine exactly what he meant by his famous statement: We could formulate the general genetic law of cultural development as follows: Any function in the child&amp;rsquo;s cultural development appears twice, or on two planes. First it appears on the social plane, and then on the psychological plane. First it appears between people as an interpsychological category, and then within the child as an intrapsychological category (Vygotsky, 1930a/1981, p. 163). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to understanding this passage is to emphasize that it is cultural development that &amp;ldquo;rst appears on the social plane. I see no problem for a Piagetian in agreeing with this statement. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is akin to Piaget&amp;rsquo;s conventional knowledge (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.3. What develops is the individual (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Vygotskians criticize Piaget for having a theory of individual development, Vygotsky certainly saw the higher mental functions of the individual as the goal of development. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-di4erences-between-vygotsky-and-piaget-p-6&#34;&gt;5. Di4erences between Vygotsky and Piaget (p. 6)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.1. Nature of the stimulus (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Piaget, the stimulus is not a stimulus until acted upon by the subject, in contrast to Vygotsky&amp;rsquo;s empiricist views presented above on conditioned and unconditioned responses that depend on the action of the environment. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky focused on the content of the stimulus while Piaget focused on the structure of the knowing individual. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.2. Nature of knowledge and psychological instruments (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Piaget (&lt;sup&gt;1928&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1955&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;1950&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1995&lt;/sub&gt;) went further than Vygotsky in specifying how social and intellectual functions have the same structure and develop in corresponding ways, he did not see psychological instruments as social in origin but as originating in the action of the individual. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.3. Nature of self-regulation (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for Vygotsky, self-regulation is behavioral. For Piaget, it is psychological. For Vygotsky, self-regulation appears after and as a result of regulation by others in a speci&amp;rdquo;c task. For Piaget, self-regulation is present from early infancy in the child&amp;rsquo;s equilibration of actions, and regulation by others does not have to come before self-regulation in a speci&amp;rdquo;c task. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.4. Nature of novelty in intellectual development (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky saw novelty in the content of conditioned responses arising out of unconditioned responses; for him, novelty is thus some form of mediation. Piaget saw novelty in both content and structure of mental adaptations. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.5. Direction of development (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky (1930a/1981) criticized the idea of development as `what proceeds from the inside outa (p. 169). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Piaget&amp;rsquo;s picture of development is more a matter of proceeding from the inside out. Viewing the child&amp;rsquo;s adaptation as constituting development, Piaget saw the developmental process as one in which the child is in control. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.6. The concept of social development (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Vygotsky emphasized the role of the social in determining development, he did not write about social development itself. In contrast, Piaget wrote extensively on social development (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.7. The role of language in development (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This di!erence is perhaps the most well-known between the two theories. While Vygotsky saw words as giving children scienti&amp;rdquo;c concepts, Piaget emphasized that children often use the same words as adults but mean something quite di!erent. For Piaget, understanding scienti&amp;rdquo;c concepts is a matter of progressive construction through stages where reasoning becomes increasingly more adequate and corresponds to what society considers correct. In this conception lies the possibility for going beyond society and constructing something new to society. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: Very interesting study of international collaboration using the sociological concept of &lt;em&gt;preferential attachment&lt;/em&gt; to make an argument about the self-organizing feature of international collaboration (driven by all sorts of rewards). Two references regarding different types of collaborators highlighted near the end are also quite interesting and could apply to an analysis of an emerging, interdisciplinary area like learning analytics and MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persson et al. (2004) show that cita- tions to articles resulting from international collabo- rations grew faster than those referring to domestic collaborations. Narin (1991) shows that internation- ally co-authored articles are more highly cited. Despite this body of evidence, the question of why this class of research is growing or why it has a relatively high impact needs more discussion (Katz and Hicks, 1997; Wagner-D ̈obler, 2001). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physi- cists studying network dynamics have found interesting regularities within the networks created by scientific co-authorships. In the process, they have revealed the mechanism of preferential attachment as a structur- ing factor in scientific collaboration. Using the tools developed by Barab ́asi and Albert (1998), Newman (2001, 2004), and Barab ́asi et al. (2002) we investigate whether these mechanisms also apply at the interna- tional level and what findings might mean for research policy. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest that a centre–periphery model may operate at a regional level, but at the global level, that model does not explain the dynamic revealed in the network data. Indeed, various scientific centres both collaborate among and compete with one another for partners at the international level. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief review of the literature examining the growth of international collaboration (p. 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 25 years, a number of reasons have been suggested to explain the growth of ICS. These can be divided into factors that are considered either internal or external to science. Table 1 cross-references these factors (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they do not explain the system that emerged between 1990 and 2000 (see data we presented in a separate paper; Wagner and Leydes- dorff, 2005) which shows significant shifts in network structures within that decade (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying network theory as an explanatory factor (p. 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the cost of “megascience” as a motiva- tor for international collaboration can be inferred from specific activities such as growth of research around the Human Genome Project, but the growth of ICS is not limited to these large-scale projects. Megascience cannot be shown to be the sole or even the primary driving factor behind the growth of ICS between 1990 and 2000. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developed another hypothesis: ICS can be viewed as an emergent, self-organizing system where the selection of a partner and the location of the research rely upon choices made by the researchers themselves rather than emerging through national or institutional incentives or constraints. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of self-organisation seemed particu- larly relevant in this case because, as we discussed above, no single factor can explain the rise of ICS. No centralized authority guides the organization of inter- national science; no single driver has clear explana- tory power. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data and methods (p. 4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newman (2000a,b, 2001, 2004) has developed tools to reveal the structural characteristics of scientific col- laborations. He has shown that collaborative scientific networks have surprisingly short node-to-node dis- tances (with a node being a single author) and high clustering coefficients (2000). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1. Data (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data were drawn from the Science Citation Index (SCI) CD-Rom version 2000 of the Institute for Sci- entific Information (ISI) for six fields of science. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the relevant journals, author names and addresses appearing in 19,147 articles were drawn from 65 journals covering the six fields. Author names were taken into the database as recorded; no attempt was made to adjust for spelling variants. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our data was limited to 1 year – co-authorships in 2000 – so we are not able to show the dynamics of evolving networks. By comparing across fields in 1 single year – that is, in a static design – we seek to use these tools to test for preferential attachment as a structural phenomenon at the global level across fields. We searched for the specific log–log distribution when a degree-based measure is applied to data on co- authorship events in the six cases for the year 2000. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, our objectives are more modest. We wish to show that the data exhibit the expected forms of power-law distributions with fat tails and hooks to test for preferential attachment; thus, we seek to use the fits only qualitatively as an indicator for this dynamic. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A scale-free network is characterized by the following scaling behaviour in P( k): P(k) ∼ k− γ where γ is the scale exponent. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.3. Fitting the power-law distribution (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to determine the exponent of a power-law, the data can be fit on a log–log scale. The exponent can then be determined as the coefficient of the line through the data with a best fit. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results (p. 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network structure and the co-authorship dis- tribution exposed in our research suggest that, at the international level, networks of co-authorship display a preferential attachment mechanism similar to that found in studies of scientific co-authorship networks. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In findings similar to others (Barab ́asi and Albert, 1998; Albert and Barab ́asi, 2000; Barab ́asi et al., 2002) the networks of collaborations shown in the figures below have fat- tailed degree distributions. This has been interpreted as a power-law form (Barab ́asi and Albert, 1998). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of adding a new link is a limiting factor in any social network, par- ticularly one focused on collaboration. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sociological explanation (p. 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that preferential attachment operates in the middle part of the distribution shown in the figures. We submit that both the hook and the tail of the distributions can be considered as the institutional constraints on the dynamics. The hook can be identified with the arrival of newcomers into the field. This is a condition for the institutional reproduction. The tail can be consid- ered as representing an elite group of scientists who no longer compete for more prestigious co-authorship relations, some of whom are “terminants” at the end of their career. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that the scale-free distribution of co-authorships that Newman (2001), Jeong et al. (2001), and Barab ́asi et al. (2002) found for fields of science in general can also be retrieved for interna- tional collaborations using a static analysis (for a single year). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support this explanation, we turn to the work of Braun et al. (2001), following Price and G ̈ursey (1976), on the role of various actors within co-authorship net- works. Braun et al. built upon the work of Price and G ̈ursey to explore the dynamics of links within co- authoring communities. Price and G ̈ursey (1976) iden- tified four types of co-authors in a review of collab- orations over a 10-year period: terminants at the end of their career, newcomers at the beginning of their career, transients perhaps from another field who pub- lish in this field only once (this could also be considered as “new entrants” per Jeong et al. 2001), and continu- ants who publish a large number of papers in the year preceding and the year following the analysis. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amaral et al. (2000) also finds a deviation from a power-law in some small world networks. They suggest that preferential attachment may be hindered by two classes of factors: (1) aging of the vertices and (2) the cost of adding links to the vertices. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;skewed: continuants are likely to co-author and rarely appear as single authors; the overwhelming number of papers is co-authored by continuants. They report that “co-authorship relations among these three categories [newcomers, transients, and terminators] are usually also mediated by continuants” (p. 508). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some become so well connected that they no longer com- pete for reputation and therefore appear at the fat tail end of the distribution: they compete to build networks of intellectual followers of the next generation. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more senior (or reputed) members of a group hold privileged social and technical information (Meyerowitz, 1985). Newcomers and transients seek access to this information as well as recognition within their field. As a result, the continuants (and perhaps the terminants), acting as hubs within their scientific networks, are attractive collaborators. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the con- tinuants and, in some cases terminants, act as gate- keepers to newer entrants into the network, creating a social dynamic within the network. These dynamics of institutional reproduction distort the self-organising (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;features of the network, resulting in a less-than-perfect fit to the power-law form. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theoretical implications of this research This article argues that international collaboration in science at the sub-field level can be shown to self-organize based on rules of preferential attach- ment with social constraints. The networks examined here have self-organizing features, suggesting that the spectacular growth in international collaborations may be due more to the dynamics created by the self- interests of individual scientists rather than to other structural, institutional or policy-related factors that have been suggested by others. (p. 9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many individ- ual choices of scientists to collaborate may be moti- vated by reward structures within science where co- authorships, citations and other forms of professional recognition lead to additional work and reputation in a virtuous circle. Highly visible and productive researchers, able to choose, work with those who are more likely to enhance their productivity and cred- ibility. These “continuants” mediate the entrance of juniors into this network. This creates a competition for collaborators. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy implications of this research (p. 9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other research suggests that knowledge creation may result from unstable networks with weak ties, where churn exposes researchers to new ideas and methods (Granovetter, 1973; Cowan and Jonard, 2003). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network of international collaboration is highly dynamic, quickly changing, and very influential. As such, it feeds back into the national, regional, and local levels, influencing the organization of science. This dynamic organization presents particular challenges to national S&amp;amp;T policymaking. The first challenge is ensuring that knowledge flows to critical places within the research system. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that networks increase efficiency by connecting rather than recreating capabilities in each national system, the overall system may benefit, but the national systems may lose out, at least in the near term. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This paper presents a case of using multidimensional network analysis &amp;ndash; powered by ERGM &amp;ndash; to model customer preferences in China&amp;rsquo;s car market. Data were from user surveys. The authors patiently set the background, introduce the techniques, compared MNA with unidimensional network analysis, and considerately presented various analytical decisions associated with these approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we present a novel conceptual framework of multidimensional network analysis (MNA) for modeling customer preferences in supporting design decisions. In the proposed multidimensional customerproduct network (MCPN), customerproduct interactions are viewed as a socio-technical system where separate entities of &lt;code&gt;customers&#39; and&lt;/code&gt;products&amp;rsquo; are simultaneously modeled as two layers of a network, and multiple types of relations, such as consideration and purchase, product associations, and customer social interactions, are considered (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Beyond the traditional descriptive analysis used in network analysis, we employ the exponential random graph model (ERGM) as a unified statistical inference framework to interpret complex preference decisions. Our approach broadens the traditional utility-based logit models by considering dependency among complex customerproduct relations, including the similarity of associated products, `irrationality&amp;rsquo; of customers induced by social influence, nested multichoice decisions, and correlated attributes of customers and products. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, disaggregate quantitative models such as discrete choice analysis (DCA) (Ben-Akiva &amp;amp; Lerman 1985; Train 2009) have been widely studied by the engineering design research community for consumer preference modeling. Following the random utility theory, the customer purchase decision is captured by a utility function of product attributes/features and customer attributes (e.g., social demographic and usage attributes) (Hoyle et al. 2010; He et al. 2012). Even though DCA provides a probabilistic approach for modeling customer heterogeneity, there are several major obstacles (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aim to develop a preference model that broadens the utility-based DCA by considering complex customerproduct relations, including the similarity of associated products, `irrationality&amp;rsquo; of customers induced by social influence, nested multichoice decisions, and correlated attributes of customers and products. To this end, we propose a novel MCPN framework as shown in Figure 1. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;customerproduct interactions form a complex socio-technical system (Trist 1981), not only because there are complex relations between the customers (e.g., social interactions) and amongst the products (e.g., market segmentation or product family), but also because there exist multiple types of relations between customers and products (e.g., &lt;code&gt;consideration&#39; versus&lt;/code&gt;purchase&amp;rsquo;) (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the social structures can influence how people conceive a new technology (or a product), as well as whether and how they will use it (Rice &amp;amp; Aydin 1991; Kraut et al. 1998; Karahanna et al. 1999). On the other hand, new technologies (or products) could bring changes to social and communication relationships among people (Dimaggio et al. 2001). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this paper represents the first attempt to introduce MNA into engineering design. The complex customerproduct interactions are represented as a multidimensional network where multiple relationships are considered, including social network relations among customers, association relations among products, as well as preference relations between customers and products. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the exponential random graph model (ERGM) as a unified statistical inference framework for MNA. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2. Development of network structures. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exponential random graph models have several advantages over the utility-based logit models: (1) network links are modeled to be interdependent in ERGM rather than assumed to be independent; (2) ERGMs can incorporate binary, categorical, and continuous nodal attributes to determine whether they are associated with the formation of network links, (3) ERGMs are capable of characterizing local and global network features; (4) ERGMs can be applied in flexible ways to many dierent types of networks and relational data; (5) data used for fitting ERGMs can be cross-sectional or longitudinal (changes with time), and a dynamic model can be built to study the emergence and dynamics of a network; (6) in contrast to a machine learning model that focuses on prediction, ERGM is an explanatory model whose results can be used to derive behavioral theories and design implications. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the detailed development in this paper is devoted to modeling consideration decisions among product alternatives. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Technical background (p. 6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1. Network analysis in product design and market study (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.2. Modeling the impact of social influence (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comprehensive study of how peer influence aects product attribute preference was provided by Narayan et al. (2011) who modeled three dierent mechanisms of social influence. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.3. Advances in social network analysis (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development of analytical techniques to explain the emergence of networks is often motivated by the multitheoretical multilevel (MTML) framework (Monge &amp;amp; Contractor 2003). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social network models have multilevel interpretations because the emergence of a network can be influenced, for instance, by theories of self-interest that refer to characteristics of actors (at the individual level), theories of social exchange that describe links between pairs of actors (at the dyadic level), theories of balance that explain the configuration of links among three actors (at the triadic level), and theories of collective action that explain configurations among larger aggregates of actors (at the group or network level). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eq. (1) suggests that the probability of observing any particular graph (e.g. MCPN) is proportional to the exponent of a weighted combination of network characteristics: one statistic z. y/ is more likely to occur if the corresponding is positive. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A multidimensional network approach for preference modeling (p. 8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1. The multidimensional customer–product network (MCPN) framework (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product layer contains a collection of engineering products P (e.g., vehicles, electronics and appliances, software). Products are connected by various links which can be either directed or non-directed. Directed links often involve product hierarchy or preference, while non-directed links imply product similarity or association. Product attributes or features, quantitative (e.g., fuel eciency, horsepower) or qualitative (e.g., safety, styling), can be taken into account as nodal attributes. Similar attributes/features between products are represented as association links in the product network. Alternatively, product associations can be identified by their co-consideration relations from customers. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer layer describes a social network consisting of a customer population C who make decisions or take actions. Each customer has a unique profile (e.g., socioeconomic and anthropometric attributes, purchase history and usage context attributes, etc.) which potentially aects customer preference decisions. Links between two customers represent their social relations, such as friendship or communication. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen, the proposed MCPN framework can capture rich information on dependency in a complex socio-technical system so as to assist product design decision-making. A combined analysis of all relations mentioned above allows designers to evaluate product decisions not in isolation, but with expectation that the market system will react to the planned decisions, and any design change may easily aect other connected entities across the network in ways that were initially unintended. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2. Unidimensional network analysis of product associations (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unidimensional network can be viewed as a compressed but simplified version (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distance measures commonly used in content-based recommender systems, such as Jaccard index (Real &amp;amp; Vargas 1996), Cosine similarity (Chowdhury 2010), Gower similarity (Gower 1971) etc., can be applied to assess the strength of connections. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descriptive network analysis involves the computation of topological measures to assess the position of nodes and the implication of structural advantages. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the unidimensional network approach can describe interdependen- cies in relational data, the method cannot provide quantitative assessment of the impact of product attributes for a particular group of customers of interest. Further, the unidimensional network analysis studies customers&amp;rsquo; averaged (aggregated) preference across the population. Advanced network modeling approaches that capture disaggregated preference behaviors of individual customers are needed as examined next. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.3. Analyzing multidimensional network considering product associations (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond existing network approaches that are mostly descriptive in nature, we use ERGM as a unified statistical framework to analyze the MCPN (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exponential random graph model literature has established more than 20 dierent types of eects (Lusher et al. 2012) for describing the various forms of dependence that exist in the relational data within social networks. Examples of eects, their configurations, and interpretations are provided in Table 2. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this paper (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network eects fall into three categories: pure structural eects, attribute-relation eects involving product/customer attributes, and cross-level eects involving both between-level and within-level relations. Pure structural eects are related to the well-known structural regularities in the network literature (e.g., eects [A] to [C] in Table 2); attribute-relation eects assume the attributes of products/customers can also influence possible tie formations in a given structure (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to a unidimensional network (Section 3.2), a multidimensional network provides a more natural way to model relations between two dierent classes of nodes (customers and products) and the non-hierarchical association relations between products. Moreover, its capacity to preserve two types of nodes allows designers to parse out the unique contribution of dierent types of nodes to the overall network structure (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.4. Analyzing multidimensional network incorporating social influence (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To account for the eect of social influence on customer preference decisions, we further expand the multidimensional network structure to simultaneously measure within-layer social relations, within-layer product associations, and between-layer customerproduct relations (Figure 6). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the prior research that incorporates social influence as customer attributes, this research employs the ERGM to assess the social influence eects. In theory, compared to the use of DCA, one should draw more reliable conclusions based on the results from the network approach, because of its capability of handling correlated node attributes and interdependent link relations, which avoids faulty inferences on covariates (Cranmer &amp;amp; Desmarais 2011). (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case study – vehicle preference modeling (p. 15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, two implementations on modeling vehicle preferences in the growing China market are presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.1. Using unidimensional network (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We develop two types of product association networks  a vehicle association network with undirected links showing the similarity of products, and avehicle hierarchal network with directed links indicating preference hierarchies. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two vehicle association networks are constructed using the 2013 New Car Buyers Survey (NCBS) data provided by an independent research institute in China. The dataset contains 49,921 new car buyers who considered and purchased from a pool of 389 vehicle models in 2013. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicle association network is created to aid the analysis of customer consideration decisions by linking any pair of vehicles if both vehicles are considered by most consumers in his (her) consideration set. The association link is viewed as a form of similarity or closeness between any two vehicles (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link strength is quantified by lift to reflect how often the two products are compared by a population of customers. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prune the network links, a thinning threshold at 1 is chosen for the lift value (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a measure of network centrality, the node degree calculates the number of links attached to a node. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the constructed vehicle network, the product community analysis is employed following Newman&amp;rsquo;s modularity method to determine groups of interconnected vehicles (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a refinement to the above undirected network, a directed network is constructed where a link direction is determined through both consideration and purchase data in NCBS. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the links are trimmed to highlight positive associations (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 7. Unimodal vehicle networks constructed from NCBS 2013. Nodes are sized by network degrees (or in-degrees) and colored by network communities. Network layout is computed by the FruchtermanReingold force-directed algorithm based on aesthetic criteria (Fruchterman &amp;amp; Reingold 1991). Link strength is not specified and has no relation to the distance of nodes (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a directed network, graph metrics indicating node hierarchy, such as node in-degree, can be computed to reflect customers&amp;rsquo; aggregated preferences across the population. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our illustrative example shows that descriptive network analysis may serve as a useful tool for designers to determine product positioning and product priorities in the phase of design planning. Centrality, community, and hierarchy allow designers to uncover the root causes of the dierences in vehicle sales under a specific market. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is a need for an approach to quantitatively evaluate customer heterogeneous preferences while addressing issues such as dependent alternatives, multiple decisions, social influence, and correlated observations (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2. Using MCPN for modeling luxury vehicle preferences in Central China (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second implementation demonstrates the use of inferential network technique (ERGM) for analyzing the vehicle MCPN framework (Sections 3.3 and 3.4). (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed MCPN integrates a feature-driven product association network, a customerproduct network, and a customer social network as a unified entity for analysis. The implementation of the proposed approach goes beyond the descriptive analysis and consists of three major steps: network construction, ERGM specification, and ERGM interpretation; each of these steps is explained in the remainder of this section. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2.1. Data transformation &amp;amp; network construction (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2.1.1. Product associations. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rsquo;. In this example, product association links in the product layer of the multidimensional network are constructed using the complete set of attributes considered, including vehicle price, engine capacity, fuel consumption, and the existence of turbo. The association link is viewed as a form of overall product similarity from the perspective of engineering design. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the association network construct, the Gower&amp;rsquo;s coecient (Gower 1971) is calculated to determine the existence of a link between any product pair. Gower&amp;rsquo;s coecient has the capability to appropriately handle continuous, ordinal, nominal and binary variables as inputs. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the empirical results, a global thinning threshold at 0.05 is chosen (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2.1.2. Preference relations. We use the between-layer links connecting a product and a customer to model customers&amp;rsquo; consideration decisions over vehicle models. The structure of these links is precisely defined by NCBS data. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2.1.3. Social relations. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the same strategy in our previous work on network simulation (He et al. 2014), a social space is constructed based on customer geographical locations and selected social attributes (age, income, education). (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;em.. so the links are not strictly &amp;lsquo;social&amp;rsquo; but based on customer attributes. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the homophily assumption that two customers with shorter distance in the social space are more likely to be connected (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mimic the properties of real world networks, we then adjust the social links using the small-world model (Watts &amp;amp; Strogatz 1998; Delre et al. 2007) to assure the high transitivity (&lt;code&gt;one&#39;s friends are likely to be friends&#39;) and low average path length (&lt;/code&gt;six degrees of separation&amp;rsquo; between any two individuals). (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2.2. Specification of ERGMs for multidimensional networks (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As presented in Table 4, the examined network eects are restricted to a subset of cross-level configurations and product/customer attributes of dierent forms. The choice of which network eect to include depends on the social theory, hypothesis, and the specific research questions to answer. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.2.3. Comparisons and interpretations of ERGMs (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hus, we employ a stochastic approximation (Snijders 2002) that relies on MCMC simulations of graphs. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the ERGM estimates for various specifications are presented in Table 4. The significant coecient estimates are shown in bold font, (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model 1 formulates a bipartite ERGM analogous to a logistic model that contains only the attribute-relation eects composed by attributes of customers and products. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model 2 parameterizes a bipartite ERGM similar to Model 1 but with the addition of the pure structural eects and the cross-level product association eect. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specification of Model 3 is the most complete model that includes all three types of ERGM eects. With the integration of the cross-level social influence eect, peer influences on preference decisions can be evaluated together with other product attributes, customer demographics, and structural patterns within the same model. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two penalized-likelihood criteria  AIC and BIC  are also provided in Table 4. The two measures decrease gradually as the addition of the considered structural eects, suggesting improved fits from Model 1 to Model 3. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interpretation of Model 1 is similar to that for a logistic model. The vehicle price has a negative significant sign, implies that lower price is preferred in consideration of luxury vehicles. The significant positive turbocharger and engine capacity indicate that the presence of the turbocharger and the increased size of the engine would increase the probability for a customer to consider a particular vehicle model. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistically negative first-time buyer suggests that first-time buyers are unlikely to enter the luxury vehicle market (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Model 2, the addition of the pure structural eects and the cross-level customer considers similar products eect considerably changes the interpretation of the underlying preference data. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the degree distribution is more centered for customer nodes, as shown by the negative consideration range coecient, because customers only consider a limited number of vehicles (13) in NCBS data. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coecients of Model 3 are largely consistent with those in Model 2, except that the previously insignificant income becomes significant, while the previously significant engine capacity becomes insignificant. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significant positive peer influence indicates that a customer is likely to become `irrational&amp;rsquo; in decision- making and simply considers what his/her peer has considered. Modeling the peer influence is a unique contribution of our work as such eect cannot be modeled either theoretically or computationally without the MCPN framework. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, including the attribute-relation main eects alone (Model 1) can explain a large part of the formation of preference links. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the peer influence eect (Model 3) introduces another layer of dependencies between two customers into the structure of the network. The significant positive estimate reflects the importance of social influence in explaining customer behavior and modeling product demand. Overall, the results of this example suggest that the nodal attributes (representing customer and product attributes) and network structures (representing product associations, social influences, and other underlying eects) are indispensable elements playing together in shaping the preferences of customers. (p. 23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion and conclusion (p. 23)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though powerful and flexible, MNA has certain characteristics that need careful attentions when implemented for preference modeling (p. 24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the purpose of the analysis, the size of a network model can vary from a few nodes to hundreds or thousands of nodes containing a diverse set of products. However, the network model could be sensitive to the issue of missing data and influenced by how links are defined (Kossinets &amp;amp; Watts 2006). In addition, for a poorly specified model, degeneracy may occur in model estimation and cause the Markov chain to move towards an extreme graph of all or no edges (Snijders 2002). This issue can be solved by incorporating curved exponential family terms that exhibit more stable behavior in model construction (Snijders et al. 2006). (p. 25)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @rose2014what&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosé, C. P., &amp;amp; Tovares A. (in press). What Sociolinguistics and Machine Learning Have to Say to One Another about Interaction Analysis. In L. Resnick, Asterhan C., &amp;amp; Clarke S. (Eds.), Socializing Intelligence Through Academic Talk and Dialogue. Washington, D.C.: American Educational Research Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter grapples with two seemingly contradictory views towards &lt;em&gt;discourse analysis&lt;/em&gt;: a sociolinguist approach that embraces &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; (such as Gee&amp;rsquo;s intertextuality approach), and a quantitative approach that strives to best &lt;em&gt;discretize&lt;/em&gt; discourse behaviors. These two approaches could also be described as qualitative vs. quantitative, or variationist vs. constructive. Using an analogy of &lt;em&gt;tapestry&lt;/em&gt;, Rosé and Tovares beautifully bring these two approaches into coherence: the many varied colors of threads (complexity) that are woven together in a tapestry are held together by a substrate of white threads (discretizeable behaviors) that give the tapestry its shape. Thus, machine learning needs to take both directions into consideration to effectively analyze interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, Rosé and Tovares explicitly tackles the commonly held misconception that conceptualizes machine learning as a black magic box. They remind us to think about (1) what machine learning is capable of modeling in terms of interaction analysis, and (2) how much information we can lose from the continuous signal and still see the culture change we are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we sometimes forget is that &amp;ldquo;a trained model will only be able to capture patterns within the space of models that are expressible within the provided feature space.&amp;rdquo; A significant challenge is to find a balance between finding powerful (rich) features and being realistic richness of features we could possibly extract from normally small sizes of training data. In our search for an effective machine learning technique to analyze interactions, &amp;ldquo;we need to focus our questions of the data in such a way that they can be answered with categories that have the potential to generalize as much as possible without losing the change we want to measure.&amp;rdquo; In other words, we would need to balance the &amp;ldquo;search for an effective computational model must balance the search for discretizations of the data that have predictive validity with respect to these external measures with a search of the space of possible representations of the data that would render those behavior categorizations as learnable using machine learning technology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this specific chapter is meant to offer an inter-disciplinary perspective on how to measure progress within a classroom community towards appropriation of discourse practices reflecting principles of effective dialogic instruction (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academically Productive Talk (Resnick, Michaels, &amp;amp; O&amp;rsquo;Connor, 2010) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this chapter explores the tension between the drive to preserve complexity in analysis of social interaction that is a hallmark of interactional sociolinguistics and the drive to find well defined, stable patterns in data that would facilitate efforts towards using machine learning to model social processes in communication, which is a current research objective within the field of computational linguistics. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to start by investigating what is the nature of the social processes of interest and let these insights drive the search for meaningful patterns in data. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the recent turn of the century, we have already seen success at using machine learning in analysis of group discussions, especially in the field of computer supported collaborative learning (Soller &amp;amp; Lesgold, 2000; Erkens &amp;amp; Janssen, 2008; Rosé et al., 2008; McLaren et al., 2007; Mu, Stegmann, Mayfield, Rosé, &amp;amp; Fischer, 2012). Work in machine learning applied to interaction analysis in this community has been argued to offer two primary kinds of contributions. On the one hand, it has the potential to greatly speed up analysis of discussion data that is collected for research purposes. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second kind of contribution is enabling real time analysis of discussion for learning, which enables automatic interventions that support facilitators, teachers, or students in their groups (Kumar, Rosé, Wang, Joshi, &amp;amp; Robinson, 2007; Chaudhuri, Kumar, Howley, Rosé, 2009; Ai, Kumar, Nguyen, Nagasunder, &amp;amp; Rosé, 2010; Kumar, Beuth, &amp;amp; Rosé, 2011). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these early successes, the tension between the qualitative and the quantitative aims remain. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we believe that reality offers us no discrete categories of behavior, it is always possible to discretize it if we are willing to lose some information and complexity in the process. The question then becomes one of deciding how much and which information it is safe to lose. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will explore what machine learning is capable of modeling in terms of interaction analysis. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we must consider the danger that the change as it happens is visible only within the part of the signal that we will lose in the discretization process. Thus, we will grapple with the question of how much information we can lose from the continuous signal and still see the culture change we are looking for. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;machine-learning-toward-conceptual-tools-for-effective-use-p-5&#34;&gt;Machine Learning: Toward Conceptual Tools for Effective Use (p. 5)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we will see is that in order to make machine learning work for us, we cannot treat it as black magic. Rather, we must think realistically about what it is capable of doing, and we must understand what we must provide to it in order for it to do what it does best. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, more attention should be given to the problem of representing data appropriately. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the language technologies community there are strands of work that can be seen as related to the interaction analyses we are interested in, such as dialogue act tagging (Dielman &amp;amp; Renals, 2008), sentiment analysis (Pang &amp;amp; Lee, 2008), age prediction (Goswami, Sarkar, &amp;amp; Rustagi, 2009) and gender prediction (Garera &amp;amp; Yarowsky, 2009). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now take a step back and think more mechanically about how machine learning works. Machine learning algorithms are designed with the goal of finding mappings between sets of input features and output categories. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning algorithms find stable patterns within these feature vector representations by examining collections of hand-coded “training examples” for each output category, then using statistical techniques to find characteristics that exemplify each category and distinguish it from the other categories. The goal of such an algorithm is to learn general rules from these examples, which can then be applied effectively to new data. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for this to work well, the set of input features must be sufficiently expressive, and the training examples must be representative. It is important to pause and consider what representative means. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When datasets that models are tested on contain new subpopulations not represented within the training data, the new data can appear very different. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a variety of manual and automatic feature engineering techniques have been developed in order to construct feature spaces that are adept at capturing interesting language variation without overfitting to content based variation, with the hope of leading to more generalizable models. Here we consider two issues in comparing across the previously used approaches, namely informativity (i.e., representational power) and feature space size. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need powerful features to represent style in a generalizable way and in order to avoid throwing away information we need to pick up on style. However, we also need feature spaces that are small enough to make the search for the ideal model feasible with the amount of training data we can provide. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that no matter how powerful the machine learning algorithm, the trained model will only be able to capture patterns within the space of models that are expressible within the provided feature space. If the information we need to pick up on is thrown away at the representation stage, no algorithm, no matter how powerful, will be able to learn an appropriate model. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, there is always a tension between the preservation of complexity and the attainment of computational feasibility. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that we need more insight into the language we are modeling so we can be strategic in our introduction of complexity into the representation of the data. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;operationalization-of-culture-change-p-10&#34;&gt;Operationalization of Culture Change (p. 10)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we consider what operationalization to employ for modeling culture change in the classroom, we must think on two levels and consider trade offs in terms what our analytic approach allows us to see and conclude. The first consideration is what if any categories of interaction we can use to model this change, and the second is what features of language are associated with these categories. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As classroom culture changes over time, is it just the distribution of categories of behavior that change, or does the repertoire of categories change? Furthermore, as the culture changes, does the manifestation of the same categories change? (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use as an example a construct from Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) known as Heteroglossia (Martin &amp;amp; White, 2005), which we have operationalized for our own purposes in earlier work (Howley, Mayfield, &amp;amp; Rosé, in press). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of Heteroglossia is linked to the analytic question of culture, virtues, etc. in knowledge building analytics. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heteroglossia dimension reflects the extent to which a speaker shows openness to the existence of other perspectives apart from the one that is reflected in the propositional content of the assertion being made. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let us now explain our current operationalization of Heteroglossia. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We describe it as identifying wording (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;choices that do or don‟t treat other perspectives than what is expressed in the propositional content of the assertion as open for consideration within the continuing discussion. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a rather simple divide in possible coding terms for contributions: Heteroglossic-Expand (HE) phrases tend to make allowances for alternative views and opinions (such as “She claimed that glucose will move through the semi-permeable membrane.”) Heteroglossic-Contract (HC) phrases attempt to thwart other positions (such as “The experiment demonstrated that glucose will move through the semi-permeable membrane.”) Monoglossic (M) phrases make no mention of other views and viewpoints (such as “Glucose will move through the semi-permeable membrane.”) Non-Assertion (NA) phrases do not assert any propositional content. This includes questions, such as “Will glucose move through a semi-permeable membrane?” or fixed expressions lacking propositional content such as “Okay.” (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Gee‟s approach to discourse analysis, in which it is also referred to as intertextuality (Gee, 2010). Gee‟s approach fits much more squarely within the highly contextual style of interactional sociolinguistics. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bakhtin‟s original formulation of the idea (Bakhtin, 1981). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reconcile the two views with the image of a tapestry. The many varied colors of threads that are woven together in a tapestry are held together by a substrate of white threads that give the tapestry its shape. The colored threads give the tapestry its beauty, but without the white threads, the tapestry would have no structure. Thus, the two synergize perfectly. Neither could perform their function without the other. Nevertheless, the two types of thread may have different properties and thus the two conceptions of Heteroglossia may need to be computationalized differently. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave us in terms of questions related to whether it is valid to discretize behavior into categories that can be precisely defined? We see here that there is not one answer to this question. It depends on what we want to know about how perspectives are treated within an interaction. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-forward-p-14&#34;&gt;Moving Forward (p. 14)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter we have argued that in order to understand the culture shift that ideally should come with the introduction of training in discussion facilitation techniques designed to socialize intelligence, we need to develop instrumentation than can be used to detect subtle shifts in behavior that occur over long periods of time. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have grappled with two questions that must be addressed in order to apply machine learning techniques effectively to build such instrumentation. First, we have explored what machine learning is capable of modeling in terms of interaction analysis. Second, we have considered the danger that the change as it happens is visible only within the part of the signal that we will lose when we scope down the analysis problem to precise operationalizations that can be modeled with a feasible amount of computational complexity. If we want to use machine learning as a tool, we need to focus our questions of the data in such a way that they can be answered with categories that have the potential to generalize as much as possible without losing the change we want to measure. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our search for an effective computational model must balance the search for discretizations of the data that have predictive validity with respect to these external measures with a search of the space of possible representations of the data that would render those behavior categorizations as learnable using machine learning technology.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @sternberg2003expert&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (2003). What is an “expert student?” Educational Researcher, 32(8), 5–9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sternberg discusses the notion of &lt;code&gt;teaching for expertise&#39;&#39;. He argues that&lt;/code&gt;we need to identify expertise in a way that is closely aligned with the way experts are identified in the disciplines students study&amp;rdquo; (p. 5). In his framework of &lt;code&gt;successful intelligence&#39;&#39;, he highlights three dimensions of teaching to help children think in ways characteristic of experts in a variety of disciplines. The three dimensions include (1) teaching for analytical thinking (encouraging students to analyze, critique, judge, compare and contrast, evaluate, and assess), (2) teaching for creative thinking (encouraging students to create, invent, discover,&lt;/code&gt;imagine if,&amp;rdquo; ``suppose that,&amp;rdquo; and predict), and (3) teaching for practical thinking (encouraging students to apply, use, put into practice, implement, employ, and render practical what they know). Empirical evidence synthesized in this paper suggests that the theory of successful intelligence serves as a potentially useful way to teach in school. The successful intelligence model goes beyond present methods of instruction that focus on acquisition of technical knowledge, and emphasizes on the skills of using this knowledge, which distinguish experts from nonexperts. Promisingness evaluation is related to all three dimensions of successful intelligence highlighted by Sternberg. It is about evaluating ideas, theoretical or practical, in creative contexts. It is abundant in expertise, implicitly maybe, and is something distinguishes creative experts from nonexperts \parencite{Bereiter1993}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is suggested that teaching for “successful intelligence” may help in the creation of future experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wish to teach and identify expert students, therefore, we need to identify expertise in a way that is closely aligned with the way experts are identified in the disciplines students study. For starters, this means having students do tasks, or at least meaningful simulations, that experts do in the various disciplines. Second, it means teaching them to think in ways experts do when they perform these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;teaching-for-expertise-the-theory-of-successful-intelligence&#34;&gt;Teaching for Expertise: The Theory of Successful Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They need creative thinking to generate ideas, analytical thinking to evaluate those ideas, and practical thinking to implement the ideas and convince others of their value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching for analytical thinking means encouraging students to analyze, critique, judge, compare and contrast, evaluate, and assess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching for creative thinking means encouraging students to create, invent, discover, “imagine if,” “suppose that,” and predict. It requires teachers not only to support and encourage creativity, but also to model and reward it when it is displayed (Sternberg &amp;amp; Lubart, 1995; Sternberg &amp;amp; Williams, 1996).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching for practical thinking means encouraging students to apply, use, put into practice, implement, employ, and render practical what they know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first set of studies, researchers explored whether conventional education systematically discriminates against children with creative and practical strengths (Sternberg &amp;amp; Clinkenbeard, 1995; Sternberg, Ferrari, Clinkenbeard, &amp;amp; Grigorenko, 1996; Sternberg, Grigorenko, Ferrari, &amp;amp; Clinkenbeard, 1999).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, just by expanding the range of abilities measured, the investigators discovered intellectual strengths that might not have been apparent through a conventional test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when students are taught in a way that fits how they think, they do better in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second set of studies (Sternberg, Torff, &amp;amp; Grigorenko, 1998a, 1998b) examined third and eighth graders’ learning in social studies and science. As predicted, students in the successful-intelligence condition outperformed other students in terms of the performance assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of three sets of studies suggest that the theory of successful intelligence serves as a potentially useful way to teach in school. Ericsson (1996) and Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer (1993) emphasize the role of deliberate practice in acquiring expertise. Such practice is indeed important in many fields, especially in performance-based domains such as music, athletics, or chess. It appears, however, to be necessary but not sufficient in other kinds of domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the locus of expertise in the successful intelligence model goes beyond how much knowledge experts have or how they organize that knowledge (e.g., Chi, Glaser, &amp;amp; Farr, 1988).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytical, creative, and practical processing apply in each of Gardner’s eight domains: one uses creative skills to generate novel and useful ideas, analytical skills to decide which are the good ideas, and practical skills to make the ideas work and to convince others of their value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;teaching-beyond-conventional-expertise-the-balance-theory-of-wisdom&#34;&gt;Teaching Beyond Conventional Expertise: The Balance Theory of Wisdom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals who have not learned to think wisely, no matter how smart, tend to exhibit five characteristic fallacies in thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisdom requires one to know what one knows and does not know as well as what can be known and cannot be known at a given time and place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisdom, the opposite of foolishness, is the use of successful intelligence and experience toward the attainment of a common good (Sternberg, 1998). This attainment involves a balance among three kinds of interests: (a) intrapersonal (one’s own), (b) interpersonal (other people’s), and &amp;copy; extrapersonal (more than personal, such as institutional) interests, over the shortand long terms, as (d) informed by values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools should consider the development of expertise in wisdom to be an important goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisdom is not taught in schools. In general, it is not even discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citekey&lt;/strong&gt;: @gee2003&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gee, J. P. (2003). What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy. Computers in Entertainment, 1(1), 20. doi:10.&lt;sup&gt;1145&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;950566&lt;/sub&gt;.950595&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clippings&#34;&gt;Clippings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, designers face and largely solve an intriguing educational dilemma, one also faced by schools and workplaces: how to get people, often young people, to learn and master something that is long and challenging—and enjoy it, to boot. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I argue that schools, workplaces, families, and academic researchers have a lot to learn about learning from good computer and video games. Such games incorporate a whole set of fundamentally sound learning principles, principles that can be used in other settings, for example in teaching science in schools. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also argue that schools, workplaces, and families can use games and game technologies to enhance learning. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give a few examples of the good learning principles that are incorporated in good games (36 principles are discussed in my book). Good games give information “on demand” and “just in time,” not out of the contexts of actual use or apart from people’s purposes and goals, something that happens too often in schools. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good games operate at the outer and growing edge of a player’s competence, remaining challenging, but do-able, while schools often operate at the lowest common denominator [diSessa 2000]. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;good games allow players to customize the game to their own levels of ability and styles of learning. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games allow players to be producers and not just consumers. Along with the designer, the player’s actions co-create the game world. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good games confront players in the initial game levels with problems that are specifically designed to allow players to form good generalizations about what will work well later when they face more complex problems. Often, in fact, the initial levels of a game are in actuality hidden tutorials. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, games create “a cycle of expertise” [Bereiter and Scardamalia 1989]. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since good games are highly motivating to a great many people, we can learn from them how motivation is created and sustained. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive research suggests that such fine-grained action at a distance actually causes humans to feel as if their bodies and minds have stretched into a new space [Clark 2003], a highly motivating state. Books and movies, for all their virtues, cannot do this. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can state that when players play in massive multiplayer games, they often collaborate in teams, each using a different, but overlapping, set of skills, and share knowledge, skills, and values with others both inside the game and on various Internet sites. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the end, the real importance of good computer and video games is that they allow people to re-create themselves in new worlds and achieve recreation and deep learning at one and the same time. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;darwin-s-paradox&#34;&gt;Darwin’s Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Darwin’s own words, stumbling across the ecosystem of a coral reef in the middle of an ocean was like encountering a swarming oasis in the middle of a desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin’s Paradox: so many different life forms, occupying such a vast array of ecological niches, inhabiting waters that are otherwise remarkably nutrient-poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days later, back on the Beagle, Darwin pulls out his journal and reflects on that mesmerizing clash between surf and coral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-zoom approach lets us see that openness and connectivity may, in the end, be more valuable to innovation than purely competitive mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-adjacent-possible&#34;&gt;I. Adjacent Possible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prestero had a vested interest in those broken incubators, because the organization he founded, Design that Matters, had been working for several years on a new scheme for a more reliable, and less expensive, incubator, one that recognized complex medical technology was likely to have a very different tenure in a developing world context than it would in an American or European hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a natural tendency to romanticize breakthrough innovations, imagining momentous ideas transcending their surroundings, a gifted mind somehow seeing over the detritus of old ideas and ossified tradition. But ideas are works of bricolage; they’re built out of that detritus. We take the ideas we’ve inherited or that we’ve stumbled across, and we jigger them together into some new shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of life and human culture, then, can be told as the story of a gradual but relentless probing of the adjacent possible, each new innovation opening up new paths to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of environment creates good ideas? The simplest way to answer it is this: innovative environments are better at helping their inhabitants explore the adjacent possible, because they expose a wide and diverse sample of spare parts—mechanical or conceptual—and they encourage novel ways of recombining those parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-liquid-network&#34;&gt;II. Liquid Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re going to try to explain the mystery of where ideas come from, we’ll have to start by shaking ourselves free of this common misconception: an idea is not a single thing. It is more like a swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second precondition is that the network be plastic, capable of adopting new configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that increase in population came a crucial increase in the number of possible connections that could be formed within the group. Good ideas could more readily find their way into other brains and take root there. New forms of collaboration became possible. Economists have a telling phrase for the kind of sharing that happens in these densely populated environments: “information spillover.” When you share a common civic culture with thousands of other people, good ideas have a tendency to flow from mind to mind, even when their creators try to keep them secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1964, Arthur Koestler published his epic account of innovation’s roots, The Act of Creation. The book was an attempt to explain how breakthrough ideas in science and art come about.
But he seems to have had little interest in the environments that make those collisions possible: living environments, office environments, media environments. On a basic level, it is true that ideas happen inside minds, but those minds are invariably connected to external networks that shape the flow of information and inspiration out of which great ideas are fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koestler was hardly alone in his interest in the roots of scientific breakthrough. Thomas Kuhn’s even more influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions had been published two years before The Act of Creation. Since those two books were published, countless dissertations and scholarly essays have explored the psychology and sociology of scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunbar to get around one of the major failings of traditional studies that rely on retrospective interviews: people tend to condense the origin stories of their best ideas into tidy narratives, forgetting the messy, convoluted routes to inspiration that they actually followed.
Dunbar and his team transcribed all the interactions and coded each exchange using a classification scheme that allowed them to track patterns in the flow of information through the lab. In group interactions, for instance, exchanges between scientists could be formally coded as “clarification” or “agreement and elaboration” or “questioning.” Most important, Dunbar tracked the conceptual changes that occurred over the course of each project: a researcher baffled by persistent problems in achieving a stable control result who suddenly realizes that the control problem could be the basis for a whole new experiment; an exchange between two scientists working on different projects who recognize a surprising and important connection between their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is interesting dunbar is using the same research method we are using. need to check his paper!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunbar uncovered a set of interactions that consistently led to important breakthroughs during lab conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Dunbar’s study showed that those isolated eureka moments were rarities. Instead, most important ideas emerged during regular lab meetings, where a dozen or so researchers would gather and informally present and discuss their latest work. If you looked at the map of idea formation that Dunbar created, the ground zero of innovation was not the microscope. It was the conference table.
* very much like deb roy&amp;rsquo;s study of the birth of a word!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunbar’s generative conference room meetings remind us that the physical architecture of our work environments can have a transformative effect on the quality of our ideas.
MIT’s legendary Building 20
Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s building 99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago, the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi proposed the concept of “flow” to describe the internal state of energized focus that characterizes the mind at its most productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But office design is moving in that direction, away from the crystal palaces of Organization Man, with their corner offices and anonymous cubicles. And with that increased fluidity—all those new ideas jostling against each other, in rooms expanding and contracting to meet their needs—it’s not hard to imagine the space generating a reliable flow of innovation in the years to come. Exploring the adjacent possible can be as simple as opening a door. But sometimes you need to move a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-slow-hunch&#34;&gt;III. Slow Hunch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoenix memo and Minnesota hunch that might prevent &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, most great ideas first take shape in a partial, incomplete form. They have the seeds of something profound, but they lack a key element that can turn the hunch into something truly powerful. And more often than not, that missing element is somewhere else, living as another hunch in another person’s head. Liquid networks create an environment where those partial ideas can connect; they provide a kind of dating service for promising hunches. They make it easier to disseminate good ideas, of course, but they also do something more sublime: they help complete ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make Knowledge Forum more liquid??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with Ken Williams’s hunch was environmental: instead of circulating through a dense network, the Phoenix memo was dropped into the black hole of the Automated Case Support system. Instead of seeking out new connections, the Phoenix memo was deposited in the equivalent of a locked file cabinet. Hunches that don’t connect are doomed to stay hunches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota hunch has become intellectually fashionable in recent years: the gut instinct, the “emotional brain” flash assessment of a situation that defies the slower calculations of logic—but which nonetheless turns out to be uncannily accurate.
The interest in this kind of hunch dates back to the 1980s and António Damásio’s experiments with brain-damaged patients whose inability to make intuitive snap judgments produced startlingly irrational behavior. Malcolm Gladwell’s bestseller Blink focused almost exclusively on the power (and the occasional danger) of the instant hunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the snap judgments of intuition—as powerful as they can be—are rarities in the history of world-changing ideas. Most hunches that turn into important innovations unfold over much longer time frames. They start with a vague, hard-to-describe sense that there’s an interesting solution to a problem that hasn’t yet been proposed, and they linger in the shadows of the mind, sometimes for decades, assembling new connections and gaining strength. And then one day they are transformed into something more substantial: sometimes jolted out by some newly discovered trove of information, or by another hunch lingering in another mind, or by an internal association that finally completes the thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustaining the slow hunch is less a matter of perspiration than of cultivation. You give the hunch enough nourishment to keep it growing, and plant it in fertile soil, where its roots can make new connections. And then you give it time to bloom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vaseline-daubed lens of hindsight tends to blur slow hunches into eureka moments. But if one examines the intellectual fossil record closely, the slow hunch is the rule, not the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of &amp;ldquo;eureka&amp;rdquo;: Darwin and Malthus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the early 1970s, a psychologist and intellectual historian named Howard Gruber decided to revisit Darwin’s copious notebooks from the period, reconstructing the elaborate dance of speculation, fact-marshaling, and internal debate that led to Darwin’s breakthrough in the fall of 1838. What Gruber found in the notebooks was a story very different from the account relayed in Darwin’s Autobiography. All the core elements of Darwin’s theory are present in the notebooks well before the Malthusian epiphany, which the notebooks explicitly date at September 28, 1838. It is not merely that Darwin possesses the puzzle pieces but fails to put them together in the right configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simply hard to pinpoint exactly when Darwin had the idea, because the idea didn’t arrive in a flash; it drifted into his consciousness over time, in waves. In the months before the Malthus reading, we could probably say that Darwin had the idea of natural selection in his head, but at the same time was incapable of fully thinking it. This is how slow hunches often mature: by stealth, in small steps. They fade into view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping a slow hunch alive poses challenges on multiple scales. For starters, you have to preserve the hunch in your own memory, in the dense network of your neurons. So part of the secret of hunch cultivation is simple: write everything down&amp;hellip; We can see Darwin’s ideas evolve because on some basic level the notebook platform creates a cultivating space for his hunches; it is not that the notebook is a mere transcription of the ideas, which are happening offstage somewhere in Darwin’s mind. Darwin was constantly rereading his notes, discovering new implications. His ideas emerge as a kind of duet between the present-tense thinking brain and all those past observations recorded on paper. (Darwin’s notebooks lie at the tail end of a long and fruitful tradition that peaked in Enlightenment-era Europe, particularly in England: the practice of maintaining a “commonplace” book. Scholars, amateur scientists, aspiring men of letters—just about anyone with intellectual ambition in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was likely to keep a commonplace book.)
Others, including Priestley and both Darwins, used their commonplace books as a repository for a vast miscellany of hunches&amp;hellip; Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality&amp;hellip; Each rereading of the commonplace book becomes a new kind of revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While both analyses varied in their coverage and techniques, they came to similar conclusions, that the literatures identified with these two communities had surprisingly little overlap, and that a small number of individuals represented a large portion of what overlap did exist.&amp;rdquo; (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In particular, there are two very active communities that both study more or less the same area, but these oornmunities hardly talk to one another (Kirby, Hoadley, &amp;amp; Carr-Chellman, 2003).&amp;rdquo; (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This difference most often manifests itself in questions of method. Some differences run deep, such as the schism between naturalistic inquiry in human behavior (such as ethnomethodology) and experimental inquiry into human behavior (such as experimental psychology). like oil and water, different deep assumptions rarely mix; in this example, leading to the boisterous and sometimes rancorous debates of &amp;ldquo;qualitative vs. quantitative methods.&amp;rdquo; The root issue in these debates has not been whether one describes the world in countable or noncountable terms, but rather what the proper epistemology of inference is.&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Research Communities Differ&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What sets one research community apart from another? Characteristics that distinguish communities may include their scope and goals, theoretical commit- ments, epistemology and methods, and their history.&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;learning in real-world situations. If we find out how people learn in natural situations, we can create educational environments more conducive to learning.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Both communities have a variety of theoretical, stances, but these Seem to be converging. The tremendous sense of optimism and promise for technology to aid in learning has taken many forms over the years, and we seem to have added more and more models of why we care about technologies in education. Some variance in these models of what ed tech buys us stems from differences in learning theories: the behaviorist model of learning implies that learning technologies are conditioning devices, while instructionist theories of learning imply that learning technologies are new types of instructional media. Constructivism implies that learning technologies are essentially environmental support for learners constructing their own knowledge, and sociocultural theories of learning may look at technology as a cultural Instrument for those who are entering communities of practice.&amp;rdquo; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Both communities share educational technologies in their scope.&amp;rdquo; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Instructional systems design was originally rooted in an instructionist tradition, although this is changing (Snelbecker, 1999).&amp;rdquo; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the learning sciences, constructivism is often taken for granted, but the debate is between cognitive (in the sense of information processing) and sociocultural versions of constructivism&amp;rdquo; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Both are educationist (they want to foster learning in and out of schools) but have differing models of how this can be accomplished. This is the clearest intellectual distinction between the two fields: The instructional systems design field has a fundamentally design-oriented, and hence directly interventionist, stance, while the learning sciences has a goal of science in service of education-better theories and science leading to better interventions. As . summed up so nicely by Reigeluth (1999a): &amp;ldquo; How to help people learn better. That is what instructional theory is all about. It describes a variety of methods of instruction &amp;hellip; and when to use-and not use-each of those methods.&amp;rdquo; Meanwhile, in the learning sciences (Kolodner, 1991), modeling learning (not instruction) is the core focus (much as educational psychology before it): &amp;ldquo; We simply do not have sufficiently concise theories of learning to be able to tailor curricula to the natural way kids learn,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo; Addressing problems in both education and training requires us to develop models of&amp;rdquo; (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thus, the link from instructional systems design to educational technology was as an instrument for structuring instructional (or educational) experiences.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The learning sciences, on the other hand, began from a cognitive science perspective. Although technology was never part of the name of the field, it has always been associated with it. First of all, the name was founded by people such as Roger Schank at Northwestern University, who came to cognitive science from an artificial intelligence (AI) perspective.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Educational technology is arguably either a very new or a very old phenomenon, depending on one&amp;rsquo;s view of what exactly &amp;rdquo; technology&amp;rdquo; comprises.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Another injection of technology into the learning sciences was driven by the home fields of researchers in the area.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;but the 1990s mark the beginning of the modern-day experience of computers as (relatively) affordable and available devices, almost infinitely programmable, capable of processing many kinds of media, and connected to a global network.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I suspect a detailed survey of authors would reveal that many had been trained in or worked with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines in which computer use was prevalent, and this may be the reason that technology was seen as a component of the learning environment from the beginning of the learning sciences field.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each of the two research communities has a different history of how they entered the educational technology arena.&amp;rdquo; (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;.sum up, when one considers scope, goals, theories, epistemology and methodology, and disciplin- ary history, there are many points of overlap, but many differences as well, between the instructional systems design field and the learning sciences. The two fields have overlapping scope, converging theories, and very different histories. But the areas of goals and episte- mologies and methodologies are changing rapidly.&amp;rdquo; (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ellen Lagemann, a historian and former.chair of the National Academy of Education, has documented how the founding of educational research in general struggled with some of these issues (Lagemann, 2000). At odds were the behaviorists, who wanted to perform an educational science that looked like physics, leading to some sort of Newton&amp;rsquo;s laws for learning; and those who wanted to study learning in real contexts, embedded in practice, such as Dewey.&amp;rdquo; (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In general, epistemological and methodological assumptions underlie generations of research and are remarkably stable over time. As pointed out by Thomas Kuhn (1965); scientific revolutions-i.e., anything that calls into question the prior paradigm and forces reinterpretation of prior understandings-are painful, infrequent, and deeply resisted. Educational researchers are currently experiencing the beginning of such a revolution.&amp;rdquo; (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The core questions of how to reconcile. contextualized . practice and generalizable research were never completely resolved.&amp;rdquo; (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Researchers in both instructional systems design and learning sciences are, in Dewey&amp;rsquo;s terms, educationists. In general both groups seek to improve the lot of students or learners. However, their approach to doing so has kept research and design separate. Learning scientists set out to uncover basic scientific principles which would then be applied to instruction. Instructional designers sought to apply theory to the problems of instruction, and systematize the processes that took theories and turned them into educational environments.&amp;rdquo; (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Design-Based Research: Bringing Worlds Together&amp;rdquo; (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The basic idea seemed sensible: use iterative design of learning environments to explore what works, what&amp;rsquo;s important, and how it relates to learning theory. How- ever, this approach generated some methodological backlash (e.g., Levin &amp;amp; O&amp;rsquo;Donnell, 1999). Indeed, the No Child Left Behind Act in the United States specifically defined scientific research to include experimental and quasi-experimental work only. Yet, design-based research continues to be an important method by which people investigate phenomena in the learning sciences&amp;rdquo; (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The nature of design knowledge-a-the idea that it can be about many contexts while implying some sort of customization or application for each individual setting-suggests that we need to be training a new generation of educational technologists who can blend research and design. It is only when our models of learning are just general enough, and design and research can inform each other, that we will be able to, as Lagemann suggests, create &amp;rdquo; usable knowledge&amp;rdquo; (Lagemann, 2002), that is, knowledge that helps us not only as scientists, but as educationists.&amp;rdquo; (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In particular, Reigeluth and others have questioned the role of design and formative research as means to understanding (rather than merely implementing) learning (Barab, Squire, &amp;amp; Dueber, 2000; Merrill, 2002; Reigeluth, 1999b; Reigefuth &amp;amp; Frick, 1999). This question of &amp;ldquo; What can we learn from design]&amp;rdquo; has been asked in other areas of design as well, such as engineering and computer science (Argyris &amp;amp; Schon, 1991 ; Carroll, 1991).&amp;rdquo; (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As design-based research (and research-based design) becomes more prevalent in education in general (and educational technology in particular) the two fields of instructional systems design and the learning sciences will have more and more overlap in goals, methods, and epistemology.&amp;rdquo; (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wieman, C. E. (2014). The Similarities Between Research in Education and Research in the Hard Sciences. Educational Researcher , 43(1), 12–14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I would like to offer a different perspective, how there is a considerable degree of similarity between research in the hard sciences and education, and how this provides a useful lens for thinking about what constitutes “rigorous” and “scientific” education research. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundamental test of research in the hard sciences is, does the result have predictive power? By that, I mean can one use the results to predict with reasonable accuracy what will happen, or what will be observed, in some new situation (at a minimum in a replication of the experiment as described by the original researcher)? This standard has served the hard sciences well over the years and, I argue, is correspondingly useful to use for educa- tion research. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the nature of research in the hard sciences is often misunderstood and mischaracterized. True research in the hard sciences, when it is exploring fundamentally new ground, is much messier, complicated, and less precise than is usually recognized and, thus, more similar to education research. The errors that lead to flawed research also have much the same origin across the differ- ent fields. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is the messiness of having many, many quantities that “might” be important, and the experimental results obtained in such circumstances (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;related to &amp;lsquo;correlational&amp;rsquo; research (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physics and chemistry are quite mature sciences, and so most of the research that gets presented in textbooks, classes, and even in the media has all this messiness understood and cleaned up. It is much like seeing a child only through official portraits taken after they are grown, cleaned up, and dressed in formal wear, rather than seeing them as they really were, climbing trees and splashing through mud puddles. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means only that one should be able to pre- dict some meaningful measureable outcomes. This is also not a criterion for the importance of the research. Importance depends on a number of other criteria that vary with field and personal opinions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a good qualitative study that exam- ines only a few students or teachers in depth will allow one to recognize, and hence more accurately predict, some factors that will be important in educational outcomes and important in the design of larger quantitative experiments in similar populations. Such qualitative research provides an important contribution to the knowledge base, albeit of a different sort than a randomized controlled trial that tests the impact of a large-scale intervention on multiple school districts. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a small fraction of what I did in my 30 years of physics research falls in this cutting-edge “messy and complex” cate- gory, and my fraction is probably larger than that for most physicists or chemists. In contrast, much of modern biology is working in much less well-studied and less understood areas of research, and there, the results tend to be far less incremental and correspondingly less reproducible, because the complexi- ties of the systems involved have not yet been so well studied and understood. In general, education research is more like biology research. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun and easier in the sense there is so much unplowed ground, so many unanswered questions, and so many potential experiments and possible surprises. Of course, in other respects, it is harder; for example, we know a lot more about the contextual influences on the behavior of atoms than on students and, hence, what contextual elements do and do not have to be controlled in designing experiments. Also, atoms do not require institutional review board approval and consent forms. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way research goes bad is also quite similar between the hard sciences and education. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The serious errors in hard science research occur when important variables are overlooked, and this is also true in education research. Usually these variables are overlooked for the same reasons in all fields; the researcher is just sloppy, or more often, the researcher is failing to adequately address his or her inherent biases. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n all types of research, it is essential to recognize these inherent biases and to have tests and procedures to prevent those biases from unduly influencing the results and conclusions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an enormous number of ways to get the wrong answer by overlooking some relevant variable, and the mark of a good researcher is to recognize, with limited information, which variables are relevant. Figuring out what to measure, and how well to measure it, is critical in all fields. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the common perception is that experimental research in something like physics is much more controlled and precise than in education, and hence such errors are inherently easier to avoid, I do not believe that is actually the case. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an area of physics research is truly cutting-edge, pushing advances in very new directions where the behaviors and likely outcomes are quite unknown, that is a very different situation. Then, just like in education, the researchers are struggling to figure out what factors are important and how to control or adequately measure what they hope are the relevant (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it is possible to be too careful. If a researcher is determined to examine, measure, and carefully con- trol every conceivable variable, he or she will be a failure, be it in hard sciences or education, because he or she will never finish (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure of a great researcher is the one who understands how to do enough, and only just enough, to obtain important results that are reproducible and have adequate pre- dictive power to advance the field. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, a basic standard for research should be the predic- tive power of the results; and in both cases, the underlying basic intellectual challenges in experimental design, and reasons for flawed research, are much the same. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool to see Winne articulate assumptions of his research program. Everyone should do this :) Neat! (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several assumptions undergird my research program. First, one way people learn relies on innate features of our cognitive architecture. Like Pavlov’s dogs, who learned a novel stimulus (a bell) could forecast food or Skinner’s pigeons who learned to behave in particular ways (pecking button on a wall) under particular conditions (when a red light but not a green light was illuminated) to obtain food, we assemble information in the world to create knowledge in our minds. Second, people also learn using cognitive tools. These tactics and strategies are kinds of information of a procedural sort. One example is using mnemonics, like ROY G BIV for colors in the visible spectrum of light in order of wavelength. Another is using schemas that describe a task, like checking whether an explanation of an effect is complete by identifying its cause, describing boundaries within which the cause produces the effect, and providing a rationale for the causal relation that conforms to a larger conceptual structure, a theory. Third, students have goals for their learning. Goals can be primal, like dogs’ and pigeons’ hunger. Also, goals can have human sophistication, such as figuring out how to study with minimal effort and time. Fourth – here is where my research has focused for the past quarter century – students are learning scientists. Like “professional” learning scientists, students construct organized accounts about knowledge and about various learning mechanisms – working memory, forgetting. They use these to design theories about why learning works as it does (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;impoverished toolkit of learning tactics and strategies (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &amp;lsquo;learning science&amp;rsquo; instead of &amp;lsquo;learning sciences&amp;rsquo;? Wondering about Phil&amp;rsquo;s thoughts behind this choice. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can learning science help? I believe so. Facets of my research program identify and track the particular effects of such difficulties that beset learners. I have developed and tested models of innate processes learners have. Mine is a small set of operations on information that help learners to become SMART: searching, monitoring, assembling, rehearsing and translating (Winne, 2005). Second, I have cataloged cognitive tools learners use as well as tools learning science has discovered that are backed by empirical evidence they work (Winne, 2013). Third, I have traced goals learners have (Zhou &amp;amp; Winne, 2012). Fourth, I have designed and built support systems – software called nStudy – to help learners become better learning scientists (Roll &amp;amp; Winne, 2015; Winne, 2010; Winne &amp;amp; Baker, 2013). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside my theoretical and empirical work, nStudy is one of my most significant endeavors – see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfu.ca/edpsychlab.html&#34;&gt;http://www.sfu.ca/edpsychlab.html&lt;/a&gt;. As well as being software that supports learning per se, it is a scientific instrument that records every observable action a learner carries out while studying online content. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier paper on science education following the &amp;ldquo;progressive discourse&amp;rdquo; approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have conducted three separate studies in science classrooms that implemented this approach within a science unit. Across the studies we have varied the grade level of the students (grade five, grade seven), varied the topic of inquiry (images and shadows, density), and documented &amp;ldquo;on-line&amp;rdquo; inquiry discourse within a computer software environment called CSILE, standing for Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment (Scardamalia, Bereiter, McLean, Swallow, &amp;amp; Woodruff, 1989) that networked small groups of students in the grade five class. Our findings show inquiry discourse, a methodologyof explaining, to be a promising approach to learning within both the topics and for students in both grade levels. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is to integrate the findings of these three studies from the prospect that explanation and intraand inter-group discourse can be integral parts of school science. Our discussion will focus on three perspectives: inquiry and the generation of explanations in small groups of students, and the validation of explanations in large groups of students; the evolution of student explanations within inquiry discourse; and finally, pedago~cal interpretations and considerations. Thus this article discusses the process of explaining through inquiry discourse by small and large groups of students, how those explanations may change during the process and the implications of this approach as interpreted by ourselves and the collaborating teacher. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explanations in Science (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, what triggers the explanation is the inquiry, How do objects float?, which arises from the domain of the observer&amp;rsquo;s experience. First we observe what we want to explain. The object doesn&amp;rsquo;t fall through the liquid like it does in air. Next, its floating is described in particular lan~,maagewithin a context of relations. The latter is a critical point because the objectis not isolated but within a system. We further propose a mechanism, (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;such as an upward force, that would generate floating. As Maturana and Varela argue, we conserve coherence with experience as we construct a mechanism that will generate the phenomenon we are explaining. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the garden hose explanation aptly satisfies many children, it would not be adequate for the scientific community. We can say then the adequacy of an explanation is determined by the listener/s. But of course there are multiple explanations deemed adequate by multiple perspectives. The child &amp;ldquo;knows&amp;rdquo; somethir~g. Is it adequate knowledge? The scientist knows something else. In science teaching what is the common ground between these two perspectives? What are criteria for evaluating students&amp;rsquo; explanations in school science as scientifically valid? (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School science is barraged with scientific explanations. They are, however, pre-packaged and validated by communities of scientists rather than communities of students. Questions these explanations answer do not arise directly from the students&amp;rsquo; domain of experience or fantasy. And if the students do not ask the questions to which these explanations belong, they are not actively involvedin inquirynor in explaining. It is a vicarious participation at best, an attempt at making sense of an abstract concept that did not arise from students&amp;rsquo; manner of experience. Comprehending textbookexplanations becomes problematic because understanding requires the moment of relevance that experiencebrin~ forth. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two TypesofScientific Communitiesand Two TypesofDiscourse (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have observed that scientists construct knowledge in two very different kinds of communities. One community thrives within the scientist&amp;rsquo;s laboratory, while the other exists in the communityat large. Each has distinctly different types of social interactions and purposes concerning the nature of knowledge growth. Dunbar (1995), for example, provides a detailed account of the constructive and cooperative, interpersonal processes that exist among members of small teams working together successfully within the same laboratory. Latour (1987) and other sociological researchers, on the other hand, have described a very different inter-laboratory community that is competing for grants, status, and prestige as rewards for the establishment and acceptance of new knowledge. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VirmaUy all scientists are members of both types of communities. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, we are describing the main difference between intraand inter-laboratory communities along a private and public dimension. The inter-laboratory community provides the public forum for scientists. This forum sets and applies a discipline&amp;rsquo;s standards and benchmarks and supports the arbitration that lets the discipline advance. These environments are high risk forums for scientists&amp;rsquo; egos and careers. Intralaboratory communities, by and large, are private and low risk environments. Scientists use this private forum to discuss ideas that are not fully worked out without high risk to their ego or career. As such, the discourse can be inquiry oriented, jointly constructed, fragrnented, and extended. The value of such a community is that ideas can be nurtured toward maturity since the inquiry focus reduces the risk that it will be discarded prematurely. To maintain a private, low risk environment, intra-laboratory groups need to be reasonably small and cohesive. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our contention that the classroom can support both intraand inter-laboratory type communities. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sinking and Floating (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;improvable ideas (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While small groups manipulated ideas and materials, and generated explanations, the large group and on-line discussions pushed the students to increase their clarity and coherence of their explanations. The adequacy of explanations was therefore determined by the class at large. In the above set of class responses, for example, students asked for clarity on the idea of one liquid being &amp;ldquo;stronger&amp;rdquo; than another. In general, we believe these intermittent class discussions provided the means to disseminate students&amp;rsquo; ideas that were formulated in small groups, raise the level of explanations as a whole, and raise&amp;rsquo;the benchmark of student learning within the topic (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;examples of improvable ideas (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Evolution of Students&amp;rsquo; Explanations (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were interested in these explanations as starting points for the documentation of how group explanations of light propagation or floating evolved over time. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analyses examined the nature and sequence of explanations citing causal ideas and variables that were abandoned, or that survived in various forms to the final explanation. Across the studies are three salient levels of explanations that have particular foei and qualities. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First order explanations: Expected outcomes (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Studies 2 and 3, beginning explanations captured in pre-testsand early group conversations usuallydescribedpropertiesofobjectsratherthanmechanisms, orrelations. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theseexplanationsarelikelybasedoncommon observationsand inferencesaboutmaterialobjectswithinthephenomenon. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in Study 1, after observing the fwst shadow effect, students first talked to each other about shadows according to how they usually appear: they are dark, size is variable, the shape of the object and &amp;ldquo;its&amp;rdquo; shadow are congruent; the shape of the hole and the image are also congruent. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally in all three studies, students&amp;rsquo; initial explanations did not provide any causal justifications as to why heavy objects sink, or why the size of a shadow varies. Second, these explanations did not involve a dynamic system of relations, such as the relation between the floating object and liquid; or relative sizes, distances or shapes of the light source, aperture (or object) and screen. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These first order explanations correspond to expected outcomes. The contextual relations of components (e.g., between object and medium) are missing. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second order explanations: Convergence on variables (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the studies, student intra-group explanations of floating or shadows/images began to change over time as students manipulated the materials themselves, and observed the related phenomena that we sequenced across the unit. Students&amp;rsquo; convergence on variables involved a deconstruction of what matters to a particular phenomenon in determining, for example, whether an object will float, or what determines a shadow&amp;rsquo;s size. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this exploratory space, explanations began to take explicitly the form of, &amp;ldquo;It depends&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; The relations of a system (e.g., light, aperture, screen) became articulate indicating a shift of some sort in students&amp;rsquo; causal thinking. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is part of a conversation between three grade seven girls about floating and sinking &amp;ldquo;things. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gid I: Girl 2: Girl 3: Girl 2: Girl 1: Girl 2: Girl 3: Girl 2: Girl 3: Girl 1: We think that lighter things will float&amp;hellip; Lighter things float on heavier things. On heavier liquid On heavier liquid. That&amp;rsquo;s what I meant. Because if you take like a brick or fill up this container with a brickor whatever, like cement, and then you take the same container and fillit with water and you weigh them together, the brick will be heavier. But with a boat&amp;hellip; Because the boat&amp;rsquo;s hollow. Yea and so take the boat and weigh it on the ocean water, how much it takes up, what the space takes up, the water would be heavier&amp;hellip;. Yea but if you mould the clay it takes up more room. So if you take that much room. Okay,lighterthingsfloatonheavierthingsiftheybothtakeupthesamespace,right? Is that better? Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s good. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dialogue began with a simple statement of a First Order type, much like explanations we heard from students in the beginning of the unit, but quickly pro~essed toward an explanation of relative densities (&amp;ldquo;lighter things&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;heavier things&amp;rdquo; of the same volume). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to their experimentation, the girls&amp;rsquo; prior idea that shadow shape is invariable (a shadow is always the same shape as the object blocking the light) becomes interrupted. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explanations typically describe a set of relations among variables they believe to be relevant to the context. The adequacy of their explanations-in-progress are negotiated within their mutual discourse. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third order explanations: Coherenceof related phenomena (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through class debate and sharing of ideas, students went &amp;ldquo;back to the drawing board&amp;rdquo; several times prior to final explanations. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last class discussion was a shared effort of fitting group explanations into one explanation, the products of thinking about all the activities and discussions and arriving at one way to interpret them. It is clear that the students had progressed from individual statements such as, &amp;ldquo;Light things floaL&amp;rdquo; In the end, students had expressed ideas, without specific scientific vocabulary, about density (in terms of &amp;ldquo;spreading weight&amp;rdquo;), buoyancy (as a force that pushes up), and displacement (the spreading of water), and how each related to what they observed. In this sense, the final class explanation proposed not only a mechanism, buoyancy, that explained floating but addressed relevant relations (weight to volume; and densities). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the students&amp;rsquo; final explanations across the three studies focused on relative conditions while the beginning explanations did not. These latter explanations involved a complex system of priorities applied to the conditions (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groups&amp;rsquo; concluding explanations were more than descriptive and dealt with issues of &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; regarding coherence of various conditions and effects within the activities (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In diSessa&amp;rsquo;s early work on scientific reasoning (1983), he explored differences between novices and expert reasoning and concluded, &amp;ldquo;Experts have a vastly deeper and more (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;complex priority system&amp;rdquo; (p. 32). We argue that such priority systems can be developed by: actively manipulating materials to produce a phenomenon and trying to explain that mechanism that generates what is happening; and testing the coherence of that mechanism with related phenomena. The latter conclusions get debated in the iterations of intraand inter-group discourse. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implications for the Classroom (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BeginningReflections (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She noticed that some students in small groups were dominating the discussions and making unilateral decisions for the whole group while other students remained passive. She wrote that small groups might work better ff more of the students were held accountable for their understanding and group tasks. &amp;ldquo;I wonder if duties can be rotated. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few times when students couldn&amp;rsquo;t convince each other about their ideas and arrive at consensus, they wrote down all the ideas and presented them in the large group discussion. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this midpoint Susan noted that the students&amp;rsquo; debating &amp;ldquo;skills in the large class discussions could be improved.&amp;rdquo; (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the last day Susan wrote that the verbal exchange between the groups had changed and was more like a discussion rather than the groups defending their ideas. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She noted that the students&amp;rsquo; confidence levels in discussing their explanations had increased because their knowledge base had increased. What was swiking to us from her notes was a description of a quiet girl, Randa, who became actively involved in the later class discussions. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedagogical Considerations (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both teaching and learning science content are formidable for several reasons. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, students are expected to induce such complex coherent ideas from textbooks, laboratory activities and lectures. However, these sources typically present powerful ideas as distilled facts and explanations without prerequisite grounding, historical context, or explanatory justification (i.e., why do scientists think this way). (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the formal language of science is problematic. Solomon (1994) describes learning science as &amp;ldquo;arrival on a foreign shore or as struggling with conversation in ~n unknown language&amp;rdquo; (p. 16). In school science, students&amp;rsquo; response of memorising scientific explanations does not in itself push students toward coherent thinking or an appreciation for scientific explanations. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose that students become engaged with inquiry and explaining. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We suggest that the iterations of intraand inter-group inquiry discourse motivates students to increase explanatorycoherence by abandoning some ideas and advancing others. We have found that students&amp;rsquo; explanations show a progressive shift in this process from explanations that focus on properties of objects to dynamic ones that incorporate complex priority systems and relative conditions. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our concerns about this approach relate to its viability in the classroom. We are asking teachers to combine small group learning techniques with a methodology that also requires multiple large group sessions. While the approach is wholly consistent with the literature on small group learning (see for example, Cohen, 1994; Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, 1987; Nastasi &amp;amp; Clements, 1991; Slavin, 1989) the requirement of producing coherent and powerful explanations is an ill-structured task. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;challenges of KB (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like learning models addressing ill-slructured tasks, our approach requires that students become accustomed to generating, evaluating and sharing ideas, and possibly debating them. In addition, like generative teaching models, what we have proposed requires collaboration and blocks of time. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we asked students to provide a critique of the related textbook explanation, by asking, &amp;ldquo;What is left out of this explanation?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;What do you understand about this explanationT&amp;rsquo; (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a learning perspective, the approach we propose falls in the growing camp that argues that cognition is a result of social interchange and is constructed, shared and spread among groups of individuals (Gruenfeld &amp;amp; Hollinshead, 1993). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, our approach takes advantage of the intm-&amp;lsquo;and inter-group dynamics to promote progressive discourse by cycling the students between the differing discourse environments. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to develop a more appropriate measure and means for assessing SPBL I want to construct a complete picture of how learning takes place in SPBL environments through the use of multimodal learning interfaces and techniques. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this research builds on the work that I have done during the past three years which has found that there are meaningful cues in student speech [15][16][17], gaze [18], programming state [19]; epistemological beliefs and identity [20]; and in a combination of modalities [21][22]. It also builds on a number of published and unpublished research tools that enable: object tracking [23]; user localization [24]; and multi-modal data capture of collaborative work [25][26][27]. To this end, my previous research has looked at a variety of modalities in isolation, but as I move forward into my dissertation work I want to begin to better leverage the integration of different data streams in extended analyses of student learning. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will be studying high school and undergraduate students as they participate in engineering design workshops. During these workshops students do bifocal modeling, computational modeling, digital fabrication, robotics and introductory electronics, computer programming, wood working, polymer casting and more. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Design Drawing Data Using digital pens and paper, I will capture continuous inking streams of student drawings. This will enable me to have the full evolution of their designs in a high precision fashion. These drawings will be aligned with speech data. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student Gaze Data, Explanations and NetLogo logs – students will be asked to participate in a pair of studies in which they explore STEM phenomena in Netlogo, an agent based modeling environment. I will log their gaze, verbal explanations and Netlogo actions through synchronous data capture. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Student Wifi-based Localization&lt;/em&gt; – Using a custom Android application, I will capture student’s relative locations at halfsecond increments as they move around the lab. This information will be useful for studying relative student collaboration, as well as for bootstrapping other data streams. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Student Motivation and Sentiment&lt;/em&gt; – This data will come from a mobile phone survey platform. Students will be asked multiple choice, likert scale and free response questions through periodic polling. This information is useful for grounding some of the interpretations that I make from looking at students speech and actions near the time of polling. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Student Dialogue Capture&lt;/em&gt; – An array of microphones arrays, lapel and head-mounted microphones will be used to capture student dialogue throughout the lab. I am still trying to find the best solution to do this synchronously, in a relatively large space, and for a large number of users. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Student Location Capture&lt;/em&gt; – Using Kinect Sensors and a Teachscape Panoramic Camera, I will capture student location and actions. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bayesian Neural Network technique created / reported in this article represents one of the new advances in neural network, which has some momentum in recent years. It would be interesting to test it in the educational setting, to compare its performance with techniques (like SVM) widely used in educational data mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important goal in understanding this phenomenon is to infer a ‘splicing code’ that predicts how splicing is regulated in different cell types by features derived from RNA, DNA and epigenetic modifiers. (p. 2554)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods: We formulate the assembly of a splicing code as a problem of statistical inference and introduce a Bayesian method that uses an adaptively selected number of hidden variables to combine subgroups of features into a network, allows different tissues to share feature subgroups and uses a Gibbs sampler to hedge predictions and ascertain the statistical significance of identified features. (p. 2554)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a predictive modeling approach, we seek a network model that can be applied to a comprehensive set of RNA sequences to make accurate probabilistic predictions for how splicing will occur under different cellular conditions, using features derived from RNA, DNA, epigenetic modifiers, etc. (p. 2555)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 LEARNING REGULATORY MODELS (p. 2555)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set of RNA sequences was obtained by mining EST and cDNA libraries and identifying 3665 cassette-type mouse exons, i.e. exons that are sometimes included and sometimes excluded in the spliced transcripts extracted from tissues and cell lines. The fraction of isoforms including each cassette exon was profiled across 27 mouse tissues. (p. 2555)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not really interested in exactly how only a single transcript is spliced at a particular point in time within a particular cell. This knowledge would neither provide an understanding of how splicing works nor enable us to predict what would happen under different conditions. A more compelling scientific goal is to infer a network model that summarizes related splicing patterns, accounts for variability in cellular conditions and how they influence splicing (p. 2555)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring code quality using relative log-likelihood (p. 2556)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature vectors form a 3665×1014 matrix, with rows corresponding to exons and columns corresponding to features, and the tissue-dependent targets form a 3665×12 matrix, with each row containing qinc, qexc and qnc for each of the four tissue types. (p. 2556)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training sets and test sets: (p. 2556)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of features is large relative to the number of examples, so methods that are not regularized will likely overfit the data. (p. 2556)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Care needs to be taken to avoid overfitting the model in such a way that generalization is not possible. (p. 2556)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 ALGORITHMS (p. 2556)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 Bayesian Neural Network (p. 2556)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these issues, we take a Bayesian approach (Bishop, 2006; MacKay, 1992; Neal, 1996) where the computational task is to sample from a posterior distribution over models. Predictions for novel test cases are made by averaging the predictions from the sample of models, and important features can be identified by checking to see if they are used more frequently than expected at random under the prior distribution of models. (p. 2557)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.2 Other methods included in the benchmark (p. 2557)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 RESULTS (p. 2558)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons of test code quality: All methods were evaluated using held out test data as described above and the test code quality for several methods is plotted in Figure 1 (see below for further details). (p. 2558)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bayesian method achieved a relative improvement of 52% over the previously published result obtained using boosting (Barash et al., 2010a), and significantly outperforms the other methods. (p. 2558)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons of classification accuracy: The log-likelihood based measure of code quality described above takes into account how accurately each method can assess its confidence in its predictions. A different, but related task is to apply a threshold to each method’s prediction probabilities and measure classification accuracy. (p. 2558)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summarize&lt;/em&gt;: This book chapter is a good &amp;lsquo;primer&amp;rsquo; for understanding &lt;em&gt;activity systems analysis&lt;/em&gt; (as a methodology). It goes through the historical context of CHAT and AT back to Vygotsky, and provides useful guidance for researchers who wish to adopt activity systems analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading and Understanding CHAT (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origins of CHAT have been tied to 1920s’ Russian scholarship. Many CHAT sources were initially published in Russian (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all cultural innuendos can be expressed in translated text format and before readers can fully appreciate what an author is try- ing to communicate (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind, Culture, and Activity is a quarterly journal published in English on contemporary CHAT research. Human Development is another English language journal that has had special issues on CHAT. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North American scholars need to gain a perspective on historical events in Russia during the 1920s when CHAT originated to understand how history affected its theory development. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky and CHAT (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lev Vygotsky was a Russian Jewish scholar who lived through the 1917 Soviet Revolution (also called the Bolshevik Revolution, the Russian Revolution, or the October Revolution). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ygotsky worked at a time when significant historical events in Moscow lead to hectic and confusing times. Many of his works were not accessible to North American researchers until the 1960s because they were subject to censor- ship by the Soviet government. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky was one of several post-revolution scholars who was asked by the new government to reformulate psychology, incorporating Marxist philosophical prin- ciples (Wertsch 1985a). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the charge set forth to him by the government, Vygotsky based his psychology on Marxian theory to describe the relationship between individuals and their social environment (Cole 1985; Wertsch 1985b). He used Marx’s political theory regarding collective exchanges and material production to examine the organism and the environment as a single unit of analysis. Through this reformula- tion of psychology, Vygotsky attempted to capture the co-evolutionary process individuals encounter in their environment while learning to engage in shared activities (Stetsenko 2005). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While witnessing the growing popularity of Pavlov’s work, Vygotsky became concerned that psychologists were taking a one-sided approach to exam- ining, interpreting, and understanding human psychology (Kozulin 1990; Vygotsky 1986). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this uni- fied framework, the organism and the environment were parts of a complex system that co-created consciousness through human participation in activities (Vygotsky 1978). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He believed that psychology ought to become a scientific field that studied the relationship between the organism and the environment and how it enabled the development of human consciousness. He was concerned that if schol- ars systematically ignored this relationship they would not be able to understand how consciousness was formed. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediated Action (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky introduced mediated action as a concept to explain the semiotic process that enables human consciousness development through interaction with artifacts, tools, and social others in an environment and result in individuals to find new meanings in their world. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky assumed that relationship among artifacts, tools, and social others were not constant and that they changed over time (Vygotsky 1987). The interactions in which individuals engage allow opportunities for medi- ated action that contribute to the social formation of their consciousness (Wertsch 1985b). In this interaction, individuals are not passive participants waiting for the environment to instigate meaning-making processes for them, but, through their interactions, individuals make meaning of the world while they modify and create activities that trigger transformations of artifacts, tools, and people in their environ- ment (Scribner 1997). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediated action involves an interaction between the individual and mediating artifacts/tools and signs (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While explaining human speech development as a mediational pro- cess involving thinking and speech, Vygotsky proposed that signs were impressions made on individuals while interacting with artifacts/tools, and these impressions assisted individual speech development as well as consciousness (Vygotsky 1987). Signs do not have concrete physical existence in the environment, but they serve as a byproduct of the interaction between individuals and artifacts/tools to mediate thought processes (Vygotsky 1978). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2.1 represents what is often referred to as Vygotsky’s basic mediated action triangle (Cole and Engeström 1993). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This triangular representation of mediated action was Vygotsky’s attempt to explain human consciousness development in a manner that did not rely on dualistic stimulus–response associations. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human activity is a process that involves artifacts that act as technical tools and signs that act as psychological tools available in the social environment (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediated action is viewed as a means of interpersonal communication through the interactions among subject, tool, sign, and object while the subject develops new signs that help them make meaning of the world (Kozulin 1996). Once a sign materializes, the subject can transform the sign into an artifact or a cultural tool by the way in which s/he decides to continue to use and share the sign. There is not a clear moment when an artifact transforms into a cultural tool, but a cultural tool is an artifact that has gained value within participants’ activities rather than as a temporary tool for engaging in an immediate activity. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian word “object” has multiple meanings when translated into English. It has been used interchangeably to refer to the goal of an activity, the motives for participating in an activity, and material products that participants try to gain through an activity. This has created confusion among CHAT scholars regarding what object-oriented activity means (Nardi 2005). What CHAT scholars do agree about is that the “object” is the reason why individuals and groups of individuals choose to participate in an activity (Kaptelinin 2005), and it is what holds together the elements in an activity (Hyysalo 2005). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keep in mind (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediated Action and Internalization (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky referred to internalization as a concept that explained how individuals developed their own consciousness. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky’s efforts to reconcile the disembodied treatment of the organism and the environment may have been a bold attempt in the 1920s and 1930s, but his argu- ments themselves were not free from binding dualistic language. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediated Action in Zone of Proximal Development (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky used the concept of zone of proximal development (ZPD) as a metaphori- cal tool to explain the potential learning of children while collaborating in problem solving activities with an adult or peer. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that ZPD is one of the major legacies of Vygotsky’s work in the social sciences. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, ZPD from a CHAT perspective is a conceptual tool for understanding the complexities involved in human activity while individuals engage in meaning making processes and interact with the environment. ZPD was a concept introduced in Vygotsky’s later works shortly before his death, and he did not live to fully develop the implications (Wells 1999). Therefore, according to Wells, even though the ZPD is a provocative metaphor, there are times that its applications by Vygotsky himself are somewhat contradictory with the rest of his theory. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the ZPD as a metaphor, Vygotsky attempted to eliminate the unidirec- tional relationship he himself created between the organism and the environment in his internalization process. The ZPD is where the interpersonal and intrapersonal activities blend and fuse and no longer exist as different entities. Vygotsky was attempting to move away from viewing individual consciousness as a commodity that grew within an individual; instead he viewed it as a shared embodiment between individuals and their environments, including social others. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Vygotsky did not clearly articulate this concept to establish how the relationship between the organism and the environment dynamically evolved (Engeström 1987). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-Vygotskian CHAT Theorists (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Vygotsky’s death in 1934, the Soviet government banned his work on intelligence and the study of consciousness (Wertsch 1985b). Even before Vygotsky’s death, Luria and Leontiev were pressured to leave Moscow and abandon the study of mental activity (Prawat 1999). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity theory was originally developed during the early twentieth century by S.L. Rubinshtein, inde- pendent of Vygotsky’s work, as a philosophical and psychological theory (Brushlinskii 2004). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kharkovites extended Rubinshtein’s work by focusing on the psychological aspects and treating activity as a holistic unit of analysis directed by an individual or groups of individuals’ goals and motives for participating in an activity (Davydov 1999; Galperin 1992; Leontiev 1974). In this process, they broadened the scope of Vygotsky’s mediated action by introducing human activity as the unit of analysis that is distributed among multiple individuals and objects in the environment (Zeek et al. 2001). Vygotsky’s mediated action is often explained as a process, but human activity from an activity theory perspective is a series of processes that is contained within an activity that acts as a bounded system. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity Theory (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributing to the development of activity theory, Leontiev identified object-ori- ented activity as the unit of analysis that activity theorists are interested in examin- ing. Object-oriented activity involves interaction among subject, object, motivation, action, goals, socio-historical context, and the consequences and activity (Davydov 1999; Galperin 1992; Lazarev 2004). Leontiev (1974)1 defined object-oriented activity as: &amp;hellip;a molar and nonadditive unit of a material subject’s life. In a narrower and more psycho- logical sense, activity is a unit of life mediated by mental reflection whose real function is to orient the subject to the world of objects. Activity is thus not a reaction or a totality of reactions, but rather a system possessing structure, inner transformations, conversations, and development (p. 10). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity emerges through a reciprocal process that transforms the subject, the object, and the relationship between the two and their context (Davydov 1999; Rogoff 1995). Additionally, the activity itself holds cultural formations with its own structures (Engeström and Miettinen 1999; Leontiev 1974). Once an activity is institutionalized, it becomes a robust and enduring tool within the culture (Cole and Engeström 1993). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leontiev provided a clear distinction between object-oriented activity and goal- directed actions. Goal-directed actions are much more temporary in nature and may be a step that subjects take in the process of participating in an object-oriented activity. Goal-directed actions often are individually focused and have less of a col- lective consequence to the community-based object-oriented activity (Leontiev 1974), and may be a means for individuals or groups of individuals to participate in the object-oriented activity. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leontiev’s definition of activity allowed researchers to explain human learning as series of object-oriented activities and move away from mentalist approaches (Bedny and Harris 2005; Lazarev 2004). His work provided a framework in psychology that did not treat the organism and the environment as isolated entities (Galperin 1992; Rozin 2004). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This position has been passed on to a new generation of Russian CHAT scholars and is represented in the work of A.A. Leontiev and D.A. Leontiev, A.N. Leontiev’s son and grandson, and V. P. Zinchenko (Leontiev 1981b, 1995; Zinchenko and Leontiev 1995). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engeström’s Activity Systems Analysis and CHAT (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engeström (1987) further developed analytical methods within activity theory by introducing activity systems analysis. Activity systems analysis is used to map the co-evolutionary interaction between individuals or groups of individuals and the environment, and how they affect one another. It extends mediated action as a model of human activity that accounts for sociopolitical situations (Cole 1996). It specifically addresses both the individual and the environment in order to move away from former CHAT methods that were too person-focused. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As introduced in Chap. 1, Engeström’s (1987) activity systems model is repre- sented as a triangle diagram. The top triangle – Vygotsky’s original mediated action triangle – signifies the subject that may be an individual or groups of indi- viduals, the tool that may be social others and artifacts, and the object that can be the goal or motive of the activity represented. Artifacts that function as tools are not conveniently handed to the subject. They are invented, purchased, discarded, and replaced in the activity (Engeström and Middleton 1996). Therefore, subjects may discover new tools across multiple activities and the value of a tool may change over time as they engage in new activities. The rules, community, and divi- sion of labor components add the socio-historical aspects of mediated action that (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;were not addressed by Vygotsky (Engeström 1999a). As described in Chap. 1, rules refer to formal or informal regulations that can, in varying degrees, constrain or liberate the activity and provide to the subject guidance on correct procedures and acceptable interactions to take with other community members (Engeström 1993). The community is the social group with which the subject identifies while participating in the activity. The division of labor refers to how the tasks are shared among the community. All of the above components of activity systems, including Vygotsky’s triangle and the bottom socio-historical components described in Chap. 1 can mediate change that may lead to an outcome not only for the object but also for each other (Engeström 1993). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human activity can trigger tensions caused by systemic contradictions (Cole and Engeström 1993; Engeström 1987, 1993). These tensions arise when the conditions of an activity put the subject in contradictory situations that can preclude achieving the object or the nature of the subject’s participation in the activity while trying to achieve the object. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three Generations of Activity Theory (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engeström (1996, 2001) described three generations of activity theory research as distinct approaches to activity theory. He refers to Vygotsky’s identification of the mediated action triangle as first generation activity theory. Second generation activ- ity theory is attributed to A.N. Leontiev’s work that emphasized the collective nature of human activity, along with Engeström’s own work in 1987 that developed the activity systems model. Finally, Engeström refers to third generation activity theory as applications of activity systems analysis in developmental research where the investigator often takes a participatory and interventionist role in the partici- pants’ activity to help participants experience change. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many studies in the United States using activity systems analysis have primar- ily focused on the descriptive nature of second-generation activity theory, and used activity systems analysis as a supplementary tool in qualitative research. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These works have provided valuable insights into how activity systems analysis can be applied as a methodology within social sci- ence research and practice. However, many CHAT scholars now encourage inves- tigators to engage in new work within an interventionist framework using third generation activity theory. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying Bounded Systems for Activity Systems Analysis (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engeström (1999b) suggests that activity theory researchers and practitioners need to examine interactions shared among multiple activities and the bound- aries of those activities to identify the potential development and changes in both human activity and societal systems. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When engaging in my own work, in addition to the typical activity theory bounded systems including object-oriented activity and goal-direction actions, I rely on activity settings and the three planes of sociocultural analysis to identify units of bounded systems in my data set. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;activity settings provide frameworks for identifying bounded con- texts in which the object-oriented activities and goal-directed actions that investiga- tors observe take place. The three planes of sociocultural analysis is a theoretical tool that provides a framework for investigators to identify bounded units of activity based on the subject who is engaging in the object-oriented activity or goal-directed action. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity Settings (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity settings are bounded systems related to the social environment in which object-oriented activities and goal-directed actions are anchored with other related activities with similar objects (Gallimore and Tharp 1990). It is the setting that provides the context in which activities take place (Tharp and Gallimore 1988). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, activity settings allow investigators to interpret how participant activities are influencing and are being influenced by the social context (Rogoff 1990; Wertsch et al. 1995). In this process, investigators will find how activity settings, object- oriented activity, and goal-direction actions are fluid, intertwined, and changing from moment to moment (Lave 1993). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three Planes of Sociocultural Analysis (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three planes of sociocultural analysis, which consist of the personal, interpersonal, and institutional/community planes, rely on the subject of an activity to identify bounded systems of activity (Rogoff 1995). The individual is the subject of activities that take place in the personal plane. The subjects of activities that take place in the interpersonal plane consist of groups of individuals engaging in col- laborative initiatives. Community-based collective global activities are the subject of activities that take place in the institutional/community plane. Each of these planes can help identify object-oriented activities and goal-directed actions into units of bounded systems. In activity systems analysis, the object-oriented activities under investigation still remain to be the unit of analysis, but the subject of that activity can be an individual, group of individuals, or an organization. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rogoff (1995, 1998) suggests that during investigations they ought to zoom into one plane of analysis at a time and blur out the other two planes. Blurring out is not equivalent to ignoring. Blurring consists of identifying the salient features of the planes that are not being examined but are essential and relevant to the study to help further appreciate the complex activities that take place on the zoomed-in plane of analysis. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary in Relation to Activity Systems Analysis Research Design (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, researchers and practitioners interested in using activity systems analysis need to understand mediated action and how Vygotsky used it as a concept for describing human activity and bidirectional relationship with the environment. Researchers and practitioners have to understand how Engeström used mediated action as a foundational concept while formulating his activity systems model. Activity systems analysis is a method to capture multi-mediational processes in human activity (Engeström, 1987, 1999a, b). Therefore, while engaging in activity systems analysis, investigators need to develop questions that will address media- tional activities. Investigators then need to design the data collection methods to specifically capture information that will enlighten them about their participants’ mediational processes. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, researchers and practitioners need to understand what object-oriented activities and goal-directed actions are from a CHAT perspective and be able to identify them in activity systems units. Activity systems do not present themselves in observed data sets in a neat and organized manner. Once investigators begin their data analysis, they will find that their data set is messy and complex. Through an interpretive process, investigators need to immerse themselves with the data and identify the multi-mediational activities their participants’ experienced. In this messy process, investigators have to parse their raw data into object-oriented activ- ity and goal-directed action units. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, researchers and practitioners need to understand how to identify bounded systems in their data sets when engaging in activity theory studies. While identifying these bounded systems investigators must ensure that the process does not oversimplify or overcomplicate participant experiences. Interpreting data involving real-life interactions in a natural setting can be overwhelming because the information that is relevant and essential to the study and that which is not are all in the data set. Therefore, conceptual tools such as activity settings and the three planes of sociocultural analysis are helpful when investigators are parsing the data set into units of bounded systems. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the landmark works of three prominent methodologists, namely Robert Yin, Sharan Merriam, Robert Stake, I attempt to scrutinize the areas where their perspectives diverge, converge and complement one another in varying dimensions of case study research. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it still does not have a legitimate status as a social science research strategy because it does not have well-defined and well-structured protocols (Yin, 2002), so emerging researchers who plan to utilize case study usually become confused “as to what a case study is and how it can be differentiated from other types of qualitative research” (Merriam, 1998, p. xi). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will zero in on the ensuing works: Robert K. Yin&amp;rsquo;s Case Study Research: Design and Methods (2002), Sharan B. Merriam&amp;rsquo;s Qualitative Research and Case Study Applications in Education (1998), and Robert E. Stake&amp;rsquo;s The Art of Case Study Research (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this paper would be most beneficial and fruitful by exposing novice researchers to a spectrum of different views and conceptualizations of case study that are provided by prominent research methodologists from differing vantage points. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, I endeavor to scrutinize the areas where these three perspectives diverge, converge and complement one another in varying dimensions of case study research. I am going to follow six categorical dimensions which the three scholars mostly converge upon in their seminal texts on case study method: Epistemological Commitments, Defining Case and Case Study, Designing Case Study, Gathering Data, Analyzing Data, and Validating Data. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epistemological Commitments (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin, Merriam and Stake have their own epistemic commitments which impact their perspectives on case study methodology and the principles and the steps they recommend the emerging researchers to adhere to while exploiting case study method in their research endeavors. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin demonstrates positivistic leanings in his perspective on case study. Crotty (1998) suggests that three notions are fundamental in positivistic orientation in research: objectivity, validity and generalizability. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin does not explicitly articulate his epistemological orientation in his text, but the way he approaches case study or research in general and the aspects he emphasizes most indicate that his philosophical stance is towards the positivistic tradition. For example, from a Yinian outlook, case study researcher is supposed to “maximize four conditions related to design quality: construct validity, internal validity, external validity, and reliability. How investigators deal with these aspects of quality control” (Yin, 2002, p. 19) is highly crucial in every step of the case study research. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, Yin’s view on the dichotomy between quantitative and qualitative research traditions might be indicative of why he would rather not overtly touch upon his philosophical orientation. He argues against those who make distinctions between qualitative and quantitative orientations due to the irreconcilable philosophical disparities: “regardless of whether one favors qualitative or quantitative research, there is a strong and essential common ground between the two” (Yin, 2002, p. 15). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stake allots a big part of a chapter in his text to the explication of the epistemological tradition to which he suggests qualitative case study researchers should cling. For he holds the claim that “How case study researchers should contribute to reader experience depends on their notions of knowledge and reality” (Stake, 1995, p. 100). From a Stakian viewpoint, constructivism and existentialism (non-determinism) should be the epistemologies that orient and inform the qualitative case study research since “most contemporary qualitative researchers hold that knowledge is constructed rather than discovered” (Stake, 1995, p. 99). Thus, he mainly conceives of the qualitative case study researchers as interpreters, and gatherers of interpretations which require them to report their rendition or construction of the constructed reality or knowledge that they gather through their investigation. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merriam seems to be much closer to Stake’s viewpoint than Yin’s. From her perspective, the epistemology that should orient qualitative case study is constructivism since she maintains that “the key philosophical assumption upon which all types of qualitative research are based is the view that reality is constructed by individuals interacting with their social worlds” (Merriam, 1998, p. 6). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an emerging educational researcher , epistemologically I position myself much closely subscribed to constructivist paradigm. I conceive knowledge as being socially constructed and emerging from peoples’ social practices; therefore, I conceptualize social reality as being generated and constructed by people and existing largely within people’s minds. I believe that research endeavors are geared towards seeking “for culturally derived and historically situated interpretations of the social life-world” (Crotty, 1998, p. 67). Due to this philosophical stance, I find myself epistemologically discordant with Yin and much more consonant with Merriam and Stake. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining Case and Case Study (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin (2002) defines case as “a contemporary phenomenon within its real life context, especially when the boundaries between a phenomenon and context are not clear and the researcher has little control over the phenomenon and context” (p. 13). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a Stakian view of case study, a precise definition of cases or case studies is not possible since it is highly likely that the accurate definition of cases or studies he can come up with will not be aligned with the definition that the users of case study in other disciplines make. As for the definition of case, Stake (1995) agrees with Louis Smith’s (1978) rendition: researchers should view case as “a bounded system” and inquire into it “as an object rather than a process” (p. 2). He himself depicts some of the attributes of case in his conceptualization: case is “a specific, a complex, functioning thing,” more specifically “an integrated system” which “has a boundary and working parts” and purposive (in social sciences and human services) (p. 2). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Stake mentions four defining characteristics of qualitative research which are valid for qualitative case studies as well: they are “holistic”, “empirical”, “interpretive” and “emphatic”. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Merriam (1998) , the defining characteristic of case study research is the delimitation of the case. Her definition is in line with Smith’s (1978) view of case as a bounded system and Stake’s view of case as an integrated system. She sees “the case as a thing, a single entity, a unit around which there are boundaries” (p. 27). Then, case can be a person, a program, a group, a specific policy and so on, which represent a lot more comprehensive list than Yin’s and Stake’s. In Merriam’s view which is influenced by Miles and Huberman’s (1994) understanding of “the case as a phenomenon of some sort occurring in a bounded context” (cited in Merriam, 1998, p. 27), as long as researchers are able to specify the phenomenon of interest and draw its boundaries or “fence in” what they are going to inquire, they can name it a case. In short, the definition she presents is broader than Yin’s and Stake’s and provides flexibility in utilizing qualitative case study strategy to research a much wider array of cases. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the definition of case study research, Merriam conceives qualitative case study as “an intensive, holistic description and analysis of a bounded phenomenon such as a program, an institution, a person, a process, or a social unit” (p. xiii). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing Case Study (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin places a great emphasis on the design of the case study as the subtitle of his book suggests. As I mentioned while describing the purpose of his book, he has observed that case study does not have a “codified design” like the other research strategies social scientists employ, which is the reason why some investigators do not grant it the merits as a notable research method. In other words, he concludes that “Unlike other research strategies, a comprehensive “catalog” of research designs for case studies has yet to be developed” (Yin, 2002, p. 19) and he obviously commits himself to this development. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining design essentially as “the logical sequence that connects the empirical data to a study&amp;rsquo;s initial research questions and, ultimately, to its conclusions,” (p. 20) Yin (2002) suggests four types of design that case study researchers can make use of. They include single holistic design, single embedded design, multiple holistic design and multiple embedded design. Holistic designs require one unit of analysis, whereas embedded designs require multiple units of analysis. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a Yinian perspective, case study research design is comprised of five components: a study’s questions; its propositions, if any; its unit(s) of analysis; the logic linking the data to the propositions; and the criteria for interpreting the findings. While designing the inquiry, the researcher is supposed to make sure that these components are cohesive to and consistent among each other. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yinian perspective (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yin Shi :) (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another point about Yin’s rendition of case study design, he suggests measuring the quality of the design against four criteria which include construct validity, internal validity, external validity, and reliability. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to Yin who suggests a really tight and structured design for case study method, Stake argues for a flexible design which allows researchers to make major changes even after they proceed from design to research. The only initial design he suggests concerns the issues and issue questions, which will lead to the design of the research questions. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stake gives important advice about the initiation of the two types of case studies: “for intrinsic case study, case is dominant; the case is of highest importance. For instrumental case study, issue is dominant; we start and end with issues dominant” (Stake, 1995, p. 16). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Stake (1995) does not suggest a specific point during the research process when data collection and analysis should start, his advice about research questions indicates that case study researchers need a set of two or three sharpened or evolved issue questions (research questions) that will “help structure the observation, interviews, and document review” (p. 20). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stake’s obvious flexibility in terms of case study design stems from his adoption of the notion of “progressive focusing” which Parlett and Hamilton (1972) first put forward. This notion builds upon the assumption that “the course of the study cannot be charted in advance” (cited in Stake, 1998, p. 22), which Yin would definitely oppose. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merriam’s (1998) text includes a chapter entitled “Designing the study and selecting a sample,” which complements not only Stake’s rendition of qualitative research design but also Yin’s well-structured case study design. She presents very informative and clear guidelines and advice regarding the review of the relevant literature for the construction of the theoretical framework that will guide the inquiry. Neither Yin’s nor Stake’s parts on case study design include such guidelines and advice. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merriam (1998) presents step by step the process of designing qualitative research in a rather detailed fashion. Her discussion includes conducting literature review, constructing a theoretical framework, identifying a research problem, crafting and sharpening research questions, and selecting the sample (purposive sampling). Merriam’s approach in case study design is close neither to Yin’s nor Stake’s; it is a combination of both approaches. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gathering Data (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three scholars contend that it is incumbent upon the case study researchers to draw their data from multiple sources to capture the case under study in its complexity and entirety. As for the tools to gather data, the epistemological tradition they are subscribed to influence their selection and how they conceive the entire data gathering process. Yin becomes the advocate of the combination of quantitative and qualitative evidentiary sources because he views them equally instrumental, whereas Stake and Merriam suggest exclusive use of qualitative data. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His emphasis on the planning of case study pertains to the caution he recurrently states: “In actuality, the demands of a case study on your intellect, ego, and emotions are far greater than those of any other research strategy. This is because the data collection procedures are not routinized” (Yin, 2002, p. 58). While delineating the preparation for data collection, Yin capitalizes on the desired skills of case study investigator, training for a specific case study, the development of a protocol for the investigation, the screening of the case study nominations (making the final decision regarding the selection of the case), and the conduct of a pilot study. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a Yinian perspective, case study research should rest upon multiple sources of evidence, with data needing to converge in a triangulating fashion, and benefit from prior development of theoretical propositions to guide data analysis and collection. Yin suggests the researchers make use of six evidentiary sources: documentation, archival records, interviews, direct observations, participant observation and physical artifacts, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data gathering in Stakian outlook is extremely disparate from Yin’s account. For instance, as opposed to Yin who argues for the exact planning for every step of the inquiry, Stake (1995) argues “There is no particular moment when data collection begins” (p. 49) since data collection can lead to some fundamental alterations in the inquiry process. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not as emphatic as Yin’s account, Stake’s account highlights the significance of the skills that researchers need in order to carry out a qualitative research. They include “Knowing what leads to significant understanding, recognizing good sources of data, and consciously and unconsciously testing out the veracity of their eyes and robustness of their interpretations. It requires sensitivity and skepticism” (Stake, 1995, p. 50). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her perspective on data collection, Merriam (1998) continues attending to the disparities between quantitative and qualitative research, which is mostly because the primary focus in her book is qualitative research in general. However, when compared to a Stakian qualitative case study approach, Merriam’s account provides more extensive and comprehensive guidance for the data collection procedures. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the scrutiny of the three different perspectives on case study, it seems to me as an emerging investigator that Yin’s and Merriam’s accounts on data collection in case study complement each other. The combination of Yin’s three principles and Merriam’s comprehensive guidance for data collection procedures would benefit me most. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing Data (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epistemological stances of the three methodologists seem to have impacted their approach to data analysis in case study, as well. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin’s (2002) definition of analysis “consists of examining, categorizing, tabulating, testing, or otherwise recombining both quantitative and qualitative evidence to address the initial propositions of a study” (p. 109), which is compatible with his opposition to the bifurcation between quantitative and qualitative research. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin describes both general strategies and specific strategies. Researchers are supposed to apply the former into each one of the latter. Then, he suggests researchers stick to four overriding principles to press for high quality analysis. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin addresses his criteria for quality research, namely validity and reliability, while discussing the analytic procedures in case study. All the techniques and strategies he suggests are conducive to enhancing validity and reliability during analysis. From a Yinian perspective, researchers control these criteria through well-defined and well-structured data analysis procedures. Yin seems to assume that through the analytic steps and techniques he describes, researchers are able to reach the objective truth about the case or the most approximated one. This assumption obviously reflects the philosophical tradition he is coming from. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stake (1995) defines analysis as “a matter of giving meaning to first impressions as well as to final compilations” (p. 71) (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stake describes two strategic ways to analyze data: Categorical Aggregation and Direct Interpretation, which he presents as two general strategies to handle case study data. Then, he presents specific techniques for finding the patterns which is an essential part of the two general strategies. However, he recognizes that these strategies do not constitute the right way to conduct case study analysis and he adds that “Each researcher needs, through experience and reflection, to find the forms of analysis that work for him or her” (Stake, 1995, p. 77). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merriam discusses analytic techniques and data management in qualitative research before she exemplifies the special features of case study method in the three sample inquiries. Her model of qualitative data analysis for case study seems to be mostly complementary not only for Stake’s but also Yin’s rendition of case study. First of all, she defines data analysis as “the process of making sense out of the data. And making sense out of data involves consolidating, reducing, and interpreting what people have said and what the researcher has seen and read – it is the process of making meaning” (Merriam, 1998, p. 178). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Merriam expounds upon the simultaneous data collection and analysis, which Stake briefly mentions. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Merriam devotes a section to the strategies to manage data which complement both Yin’s and Stake’s account. Especially those novice researchers who want to make use of a computer software program to handle the data would find this section of the chapter quite useful. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validating Data (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yin explains (construct, internal and external) validity and reliability in traditional sense at the outset of his text prior to describing the procedures of case study design and deems them as the criteria to judge the quality of the research. He repeatedly reminds the (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stake discusses the issues regarding validation of the gathered data in a chapter called “Triangulation.” (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Stake’s constructivist epistemology evinces itself in his view of data validation, which is opposed to Yin’s (2002) view. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merriam’s view on data validation manifests her epistemic commitments, too. She notes “One of the assumptions underlying qualitative research is that reality is holistic, multidimensional, and ever-changing; it is not a single, fixed, objective phenomenon waiting to be discovered, observed, and measured as in quantitative research” (Merriam, 1998, p. 202). (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merriam observes that applying data validation criteria into an inquiry which is conducted by researchers who are coming from a totally different and opposing epistemology is “something of a misfit” (Merriam, 1998, p. 206). Therefore, she summarizes how qualitative methodologists conceive of these notions and what alternatives they present. Then, she provides techniques or strategies which qualitative researchers can use so as to enhance validity and reliability in the sense they are conceptualized in qualitative tradition. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrapping up the juxtaposition of three case study approaches, I present a table (See table 1), which can best serve to provide an overall synthesized assessment of those approaches. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhang, J., Skryabin, M., &amp;amp; Song, X. (2016). Understanding the dynamics of MOOC discussion forums with simulation investigation for empirical network analysis (SIENA). Distance Education, 37(3), 270–286. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1080/01587919.2016.1226230&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/01587919.2016.1226230&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting and well-grounded study of MOOC forums using SIENA. It adopts a hypothesis-testing paradigm. The discussion of the literation is extensive and useful. The findings could be further discussed. For example, I would like to see the authors&amp;rsquo; discussion of why reciprocity declined across the time periods. More details about the course design and its potential impact on forum  activities would also be useful. Overall, a nice study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four network effects— homophily, reciprocity, transitivity, and preferential attachment—were tested to explain the dynamic mechanisms of interaction in the MOOC forum. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major purpose of the discussion forum and its activities is to allow students to engage in an exploration of their ideas to develop their knowledge and understanding of the subject matter, hopefully resulting in improved learning. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A promising approach for the analysis of the dynamics of such free-flowing discussion forums is simula- tion investigation for empirical network analysis (SIENA), which enables insight into the changes of the studied network using a family of actor-driven models, that is, creating, maintaining, or terminating ties by an individual actor from other actors (Snijders, van de Bunt, &amp;amp; Steglich, 2010). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this study sought to measure the dynamic mecha- nisms by which networks are formed among MOOC participants. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential of network science for studying MOOC interactions (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lassic types of social network analysis (SNA) studies (e.g., Xu, Zhang, Li, &amp;amp; Yang, 2015) have tended to be descriptive (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have realized the importance of exploring the changes in discussion forums. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or example, Yang, Sinha, Adamson, and Rosé (2013), in their preliminary work by applying SNA to measure the net- work graph at different points in time, examined how students interacted with their com- munity as it existed at the time of their entry. This type of research is by nature exploratory rather than hypothesis-driven. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, collaboration between network scientists and educational researchers has fortuitously resulted in the development of an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the dynamics of networks in educational settings. As an example, the work by gillani et al. (2014) adopted complex network analysis to explore the vulnerability and information dif- fusion potential of the MOOC discussion forums. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potentials of understanding network dynamics for social learning (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network view offers important contributions to knowledge about how learning is occurring among participants, as it provides measures such as hierarchy, clustering, or connectivity to describe what holds the network together (Haythornthwaite &amp;amp; De Laat, 2010). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learning is a social process which takes place beyond the individual mind (see Levy, 2011; Viswanathan, 2012), and SNA sits comfortably within this broad per- spective of social learning theory. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the social-ecological systems literature, the concepts of sustainability, resil- ience, and robustness are implicitly similar or, at least, highly related terms (Berkes &amp;amp; Folke, 1998). These concepts refer to the capacity of a system to retain its basic functions when subject to unforeseen change. In MOOCs, if highly active learners drop out, the discussion network is likely to encounter a sudden change in its structure, and the discussion might shift in a way where others jump in to lead the conversation, move in a different direction, or fizzle out. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effects of network dynamics (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study focuses specifically on using network configurations (reciprocity, transitivity, and preferential attachment) and actor covariant (homophily) to examine the overall change in relationships formed in a MOOC discussion forum, and explaining how these four network effects could be used as metrics to inform the design of a better social learning environment. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 1 (H1) There is a tendency towards reciprocation in the studied MOOC network (i → j and j → i). (dyadic level) (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 2 (H2) There is a tendency towards network cohesiveness (i.e., increasing transitivity and reducing distance between actors; i → j, j → k and i → k). (triadic level) (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homophily, which is a term coined by Lazarsfeld and Merton (1954), refers to the tendency of individuals to associate with those similar to themselves. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homophily is one of the most pervasive and robust tendencies of the way in which people interact with others (see McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &amp;amp; Cook, 2001). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 3 (H3) There is a tendency towards an increasing volume of interactions between students. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preferential attachment represents the tendency of heavily connected nodes to receive more connections in a network. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 4 (H4) There is a tendency towards preferential attachment within the studied network. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context of this study is the ‘Introduction to Psychology’ (30700313X) Spring 2014 course at Tsinghua University (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xuetangx.com/courses/TsinghuaX/30700313X/_/about&#34;&gt;https://www.xuetangx.com/courses/TsinghuaX/30700313X/_/about&lt;/a&gt;), which is a required undergraduate course for majors in the Department of Psychology. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there was no group assigned by the instructor, the discus- sion forum served as an optional, open, and loosely structured environment for participants to communicate and collaborate if they wished to do so. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this course had a rather popular discussion forum where students asked and answered questions by others. About 5000 discussion messages were posted online during the first offering of the course (April 2014–September 2014). Some of these messages were in the form of enquiries about subject matter, exercises, course mate- rials, and the logistics of the course. Students also used the discussion forum as a platform to report on their own study, as well as seek out social activities. Some of the messages also included feedback on the course. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ach one of these discussions may consist of one or more posts, which might be responded to with replies or comments. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study adopted SIENA, which performs statistical estimation of stochastic actor-driven models for repeated measures of empirical networks (Snijders et al., 2010). The family of the dynamic actor-driven models assumes that participants who are represented by the nodes in the network play a crucial role in changing their connections to others (Steglich, Snijders, &amp;amp; Pearson, 2010). The behaviors of actors (treated as dependent variables) affect network dynamics, and in return, the network dynamics influence their behaviors, which is seen as a co-evolution of networks and behavior (Snijders, 2011). The method is implemented in the R package RSiena (SIENA version 4), developed by Snijders et al. (2010; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www&#34;&gt;https://www&lt;/a&gt;. stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying assumption of actor-driven models to the analysis of data is that all net- work changes can be broken down into very small steps, so-called ministeps, in which one actor creates or terminates one outgoing tie. These ministeps are probabilistic and made sequentially. Whether an actor makes a ministep, as well as which ministep an actor will make, is estimated by means of an objective function that actors are assumed to optimize. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective function, which is used in this research, depends on two types of effects: structural and covariate. Structural effects capture endogenous network mechanisms. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the following structural effects were used: • Reciprocity is represented by the number of reciprocated ties (measure of mutuality). Reciprocity estimates the probability of participant B replying to participant A, given that A has replied to B. • Transitive triplets or transitivity is represented by the number of ties to participants who are the friends of my friends (measure of network closure; that is, transitivity estimates the probability of A replying to C, if A has replied to B, and B has replied to C). • Activity of alter is defined by the sum of the outdegrees of the others to whom the actor is tied (measure of activity attraction; that is, participants who have already received many replies are likely to be replied to by others). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covariate effects estimate the network dynamics based on exogenous factors, for exam- ple, the role of actors. In this research, one dyadic constant covariate effect (same role) was used: • Same role is coded as 0 for students, and the non-student role (i.e., instructor and TA) was coded as 1. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the conjectured hypotheses, three models were defined. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SIENA, the conditional method of moments estimation (MoM) was used to decide how significant the structural and covariate effects were (Ripley, Snijders, Boda, Voros, &amp;amp; Preciado, 2015). The conditioning variable was the total number of observed changes (distance) in the network variable. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolving network was examined using SIENA with six time periods (see Observation time in Table 1), with approximately equal number of messages (i.e., posts, replies and com- ments) being posted in each time period. As interactions in MOOCs are asynchronous and replies to messages can occur later, the network grows with time. Thus, the accumulated number of links was used for analysis in each period. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this MOOC course, 1915 participants posted 5251 messages in total, of which 217 are original posts, 2553 are replies to the original posts, and 2481 are comments to the replies (see Table 2). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIENA estimations (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate parameter estimates the speed with which the dependent variable will change over two sequential time periods. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reciprocity effect is significant and, in model 1, varies from 2.9055 to 5.8586 in different time periods. Thus, hypothesis H1, which asserts that there is a tendency to create reciprocal links, is accepted. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but is it true that the network became less reciprocal over these time periods? (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transitivity effect is significant with a positive coefficient ranging from 1.2575 to 3.1882. At the triadic level, it is confirmed (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Table 3, same role is a significant covariate effect (p &amp;lt; 0.001) with the negative coefficients in six periods of obser- vational time. Thus, the considered network is heterophilic; that is, participants do not have a preference for creating links with those similar to themselves. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the definition of same-role is a bit narrow, because there are many other learner characteristics that could be considered (edu levels, regions, etc) and the learner-nonlearner contrast is not well balanced in number. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the activity of alter effect is significant ( p &amp;lt; 0.005), with a coefficient that is positive but relatively small: it varies from 0.0545 to 0.2920 in different time periods. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zheng, S., Han, K., Rosson, M. B., &amp;amp; Carroll, J. M. (2016). The role of social media in MOOCs. In Proceedings of the Third (2016) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale - L@S ’16 (pp. 419–428).

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice paper investigating social media (more specifically Facebook groups) in three MOOCs. The key findings include that FB is a better place for social engagement, and students feel more connected, behave better, and interact more in FB. These claims are supported by both (quite simple) stats and interviews with students and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing reported in this paper is that discussions on FB are mostly initiated by the instructors (and therefore represents better pedagogical supports for discussion). This observation tends to contradict with my earlier assumption that FB better supports student-initiated discussions. Potentially interesting for future investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;diverse motivations, which lead to a variety of learning behaviors and innovative uses of MOOCs [13, 24]. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to meet social needs (e.g., make friends) rather than to learn per se &lt;a href=&#34;p. 1&#34;&gt;13, 24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is a lack of (1) empirical studies of social media use and engagement compared to embedded MOOC forums; and (2) rationales for social media use from both instructors’ and students’ perspectives. We addressed these open issues through the collection and analysis of real usage data from three MOOC forums and their associated social media (i.e., Facebook) groups as well as conducting interviews of instructors and students. We found that students show higher engagement and retention in social media than in MOOC forums, and identified both instructors’ and students’ perspectives that lead to the results. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is little support for social activities &lt;a href=&#34;p. 1&#34;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cultivate an active learning environment, MOOC instructors have often recruited a variety of external tools, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google plus, etc. into their MOOCs [24, 26, 29]. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We applied quantitative and qualitative methods through the analysis of usage log data of three MOOCs from Coursera and each MOOC’s Facebook groups. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;although there were more people enrolled and more posts shared in Coursera relative to the smaller group of people who joined the Facebook groups, when it comes to user engagement, Facebook was a more attractive place for them to stay actively and longer. Our interviews with students highlight four main reasons of why they prefer to use Facebook — a real community in Facebook, instructor imitated discussion forum, a better collaborative place, and more convenient to communicate with others. Our interviews with instructors unveil four main motivations of using Facebook from their perspectives — enhancing student retention and engagement, cultivating a sense of community, advertising their MOOCs, and being creative. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METHOD (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official Facebook Group (also used as Facebook) is Facebook group constructed by MOOC instructors or/and teaching assistants. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Analysis (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data and Data Collection Our data include three types. The first type is student usage data on Coursera of three different MOOCs. The usage data consists of click stream data, which documented students’ all posting activities (e.g., posts, comments, and votes) on Coursera and the time of each activity occurs. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second type is student usage data from three official Facebook groups (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For qualitative data (i.e., interviews), we use thematic analysis and grounded theory (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third type is the interview data from instructors and students of the three MOOCs (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESULTS (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement in posting activities (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;much fewer people joined Facebook than Coursera (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;people tended to add more comments for each post in Facebook than Coursera as well as much more Likes for each post in Facebook than Votes in Coursera, showing higher engagement in social media (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement over time (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last measurement on engagement, we took the timestamps in the posts, calculated the number of posts for each day, and plotted a ratio of engagement by day. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we defined engaged users who shared posts, comments, or votes in Coursera or Likes in Facebook at least once (if not more than once) during the course. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in Figure 2, we can see that the engagement in Coursera significantly dropped (especially well exhibited in Arts and CIC) after two or three weeks. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;engagement decreased more rapidly in Coursera (p &amp;lt; 0.001) than in Facebook (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students’ Perspective: Learning Experiences between Facebook and Coursera (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have generated 4 themes that students made the comparisons between Facebook and Coursera forum based on their experiences. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Real Community in Facebook (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Facebook, they know some “real” amazing people, have follow up conversations and discussions, gain more quick feedback and attentions, and also have fun moments, all of which are hard to find in Coursera forum. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust would be hard to build in this case. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when it comes to a level of engagement, Facebook seems a more attractive place to stay longer and engage more. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coursera did not provide a course roster; thus, it is hard to maintain a conversation or a friendship there. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these empirical results, we were motivated to study the following questions: Does social media play different or unique roles in making people more engaged in an online course compared to official forums? Can we identify some of those elements from social media and think about a better approach to enhance students’ retention, which will be both beneficial for instructors and students? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our participants believe Coursera is just a short-term place (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better Place for Collaboration in Facebook (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they build their own private groups on Facebook. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Convenient to Communicate with Others in Facebook (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;convenient access is a big factor they visit Facebook group more than Coursera (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructors/TAs Initialed Discussion in Facebook (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is very difficult to have conversations with the instructor on Coursera. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in Facebook, instructors or TAs usually initiate posts first and students could have comments under the post. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nstructors’ Perspective (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivations (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving Retention and Engagement (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being Creative (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enemy of creativity, according to Robinson, is standardization [20]. MOOCs today rely heavily on standardized tests because the massive scale makes personalized learning impossible. Our instructors believe this is not an ideal way to teach students. They hope students can understand divergent thinking and seek multiple answers to a problem. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultivating a Sense of Community (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceptions (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Positive Feelings in Facebook (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a more friendly environment in Facebook (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but in Coursera, complains and rude words frequent appear (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertising the Course (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More like a community in Facebook (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affordances of Facebook provide students a relatively trusting environment and foster more interactions between students, thus helping them to form a healthy community – all of which are lacking in Coursera. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaos Discussion Forum in Coursera (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for example, each week’s topic has a separate space to discuss. However, the structure is hard to maintain (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, the design of forum is unaesthetic, even instructors consider the design is boring (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You cannot imagine how painful I was when I tried to look through the comments. The design of the forum is very boring, especially when I need to go through so many comments&amp;hellip; Also, the structure of the forum is chaos. I need to answer the same question repeatedly in different threads. Why don’t pull them together?” &lt;a href=&#34;p. 8&#34;&gt;Instructor 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION AND DESIGN IMPLICATIONS (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching Presence in MOOCs (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Facebook, all posts were initiated by the instructors and the students made comments to the posts. In contrast, the posts in Coursera were primarily student-initiated. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we should consider how to gain inspiration from Facebook for the better design of Coursera forums. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this also demonstrates the involvement of instructors and TAs is important to make the forum popular and reliable. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Presence in MOOCs (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future work could explore learning and social behaviors of different groups of students (Facebook user VS. non-Facebook user; heavy Facebook user VS. light Facebook user, etc). (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedagogy Matters (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big differences between the two communication spaces is that in Facebook, instructors design/select the outline of the discussion topics and lead the discussion but in Coursera, the forum is student initiated and develops on its own. The results demonstrated that discussions need to be pedagogically designed. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
 I do not totally follow the conclusions made here. On the one hand, the authors were accusing discussion forums of being boring. On other hand, they prefer teacher-initiated discussions on FB. I understand those two are not about the same thing, but more elaboration between them could be helpful. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the importance of individuals assuming personal responsibility and control for their own acquisition of knowledge and skill. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gardner (1963), former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, who suggested that (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;the ultimate goal of the education system is shift to the individual the burden of pursuing his own education&amp;rdquo; (p. 21). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how students become masters of their own learning, a topic that has become known as self-regulated learning (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Schunk, 1989). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEFINITIONS OF SELF-REGULATED LEARNING (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although definitions of self-regulated learning involving specific processes often differ on the basis of researchers&amp;rsquo; theoretical orientations, a common conceptualization of these students has emerged as metacognitively,motivationally, and behaviorally active participants in their own learning (Zimmerman, 1986). In terms of metacognitive processes, self-regulated learners plan, set goals, organize, self-monitor, and self-evaluateat various points during the (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feature 1&lt;br /&gt;
 a common conceptualization of these students has emerged as metacognitively, motivationally, and behaviorally active participants in their own learning. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;process of acquisition (Corno, 1986, 1989; Ghatala, 1986; Pressley, Borkowski, OE Schneider, 1987). These processes enable them to be selfaware, knowledgeable, and decisive in their approach to learning. In terms of motivational processes, these learners report high self-efficacy, selfattributions, and intrinsic task interest (Borkowski et al., in press; Schunk, 1986; Zimmerman, 1985). To observers, they are self-starters who display extraordinary effort and persistence during learning. In their behavioral processes, self-regulatedlearners select, structure, and create environments that optimize learning (Henderson, 1986; Wang &amp;amp; Peverly, 1986; Zimmerman 8 Martinez-Pons, 1986). They seek out advice, information, and places where they are most likely to learn; they self-instruct during acquisition and self-reinforceduring performance enactments (Diaz &amp;amp; Neal, in press; Rohrkemper, 1989). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-regulated learning strategies refer to actions and processes directed at acquisition of information or skills that involve agency, purpose, and instrumentality perceptions by learners. Undoubtedly, all learners use regulatory processes to some degree, but self-regulated learners are distinguished by (a) their awareness of strategic relations between regulatory processes or responses and learning outcomes and (b) their use of these strategies to achieve their academic goals. Systematic use of metacognitive, motivational, and/or behavioral strategies is a key feature of most definitions of self-regulated learners (Zimmerman, 1989a). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature 2&lt;br /&gt;
 A second feature of most definitions of self-regulated learning is a &amp;ldquo;self-oriented feedback&amp;rdquo; loop (Carver &amp;amp; Scheier, 1981; Zimmerman, 1989b) (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second feature of most definitions of self-regulated learning is a &amp;ldquo;self-oriented feedback&amp;rdquo; loop (Carver &amp;amp; Scheier, 1981; Zimmerman, 1989b). This loop entails a cyclic process in which students monitor the effectiveness of their learning methods or strategies and react to this feedback in a variety of ways, ranging from covert changes in selfperception to overt changes in behavior such as altering the use of a learning strategy. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phenomenological theories of self-regulated learning (e.g., McCombs, 1986, 1989) depict this feedback loop in terms of covert perceptual processes such as self-esteem and self-concepts, whereas operant theories (e.g., Mace, Belfiore, &amp;amp; Shea, 1989) favor overt descriptions in terms of self-,recording,self-instruction, and self-reinforcement responses. Social cognitive theorists (e.g., Bandura, 1989) caution against viewing this control loop in terms of only negative feedback (Le., seeking to reduce differences between one&amp;rsquo;s goals and observed outcomes); they report a positive feedback effect as well (i.e., seeking to raise one&amp;rsquo;s goals based on observed outcomes). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third feature of definitions of self-regulated learning is an indication of how and why students choose to use a particular strategy or response. Because self-regulated learning involves temporally delimited strategies or responses, students&amp;rsquo; efforts to initiate and regulate them proactively require preparation time, vigilance, and effort. Unless the outcomes of these efforts are sufficiently attractive, students will not be motivated to self-regulate. They may choose not to self-regulate their learning when the opportunity arises-an outcome that requires a comprehensive accounting of their academicmotivational processes. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third feature of definitions of self-regulated learning is an indication of how and why students choose to use a particular strategy or response. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of theories of self-regulated learning is that student learning and motivation are treated as interdependent processes that cannot be fully understood apart from each other. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, self-regulated learning involves more than a capability to execute a learning response by oneself (i.e., self-control) and more than a capability to adjust learning responses to new or changing conditions from negative feedback. It involves proactive efforts to seek out and profit from learning activities. At this level, learners are not only self-directed in a metacognitive sense but are self-motivated as well. Their skill and will are integrated components of self-regulation (see McCombs and Marzano, this issue). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, definitions of students&amp;rsquo; self-regulated learning involve three features: their use of self-regulated learning strategies, their responsiveness to self-oriented feedback about learning effectiveness, and their interdependent motivational processes. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STUDENTS&amp;rsquo; SELF-REGULATED LEARNING STRATEGIES (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral strategies have been studied at a number of universities and laboratories throughout the world (see reviews by Pressley et al., 1987; Simons &amp;amp; Beukhof, 1987; Weinstein &amp;amp; Mayer, 1986; Zimmerman, 1989b). Contributors t o this journal issue have been extensively involved in research on strategy training, including such strategies as self-instruction, verbal elaboration, text comprehension monitoring, goal setting, and selfrecording, and describe their research and its implications in their respective articles. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His or her responses were recorded and later scored for the presence of 1 or more of 14 self-regulxted learning strategies, namely, self-evaluation, organization and transformation, goal setting and planning, information seeking, record keeping, self-monitoring, environmental structuring, giving self-consequences, rehearsing and memorizing, seeking social assistance (peers, teacher, or other adults), and reviewing (notes, books, or tests). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our first investigation (Zimrnerman &amp;amp; Martinez-Pons, 1986), we correlated high school students&amp;rsquo; strategy reports with their achievement track placement in school. Forty of the students were drawn from the advanced academic track in their school, and the remaining 40 were drawn from lower tracks. Compared to students in lower tracks, youngsters from the advanced track reported significantly greater use of all strategies but one, self-evaluation. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factor analyses of these two sets of scores reveal a single, Self-Regulated Learning factor that accounts for nearly 80% of the variance. All the items of the teacher rating scale loaded highly on this Self-Regulated Learning factor, and the students&amp;rsquo; verbal and mathematical achievement scores loaded partly on this factor and partly on a second General-Ability factor as expected. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MONITORING SELF-ORIENTED FEEDBACK AND RELATED DECISION MAKING (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial optimism that teaching students&amp;rsquo; various learning strategies would lead to improved self-regulated learning has cooled with mounting evidence that strategy use involves more than mere knowledge of a strategy (Schneider, 11985). (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together these studies suggest that multicomponent training involving self-monitoring and related decision making is necessary in order to teach students to interpret feedback from their academic learning optimally; however, it is not yet clear in this research which specific components of self-regulation are most essential. Finally, it should be noted that Harris and her colleagues found that self-regulation training not only improved students&amp;rsquo; learning, but it also improved their perceptions of efficacy, a widely studied measure of students&amp;rsquo; motivation to self-regulate. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOTIVATING SELF-REGULATED LEARNING (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their view, self-regulated learning requires more than cognitive skill; it requires a will or motivational component as well. When students understand that they are creative agents, responsible for and capable of self-development and self-determination of their goals, their self as an agent will provide the motivation necessary for self-regulation. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to this phenomenological emphasis on global self-system structures as the source of personal agency, social cognitive approaches to self-regulated learning (e.g., Bandura, 1986; Schunk, 1989; Zimmerman, 1989b)have focused on perceptions of self-efficacy as the ultimate source of students&amp;rsquo; motivation. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahoney (1974) noted that problems in self-regulation typically arise when discrepancies occur between short-term outcomes and long-term outcomes. For example, during academic studying, students must sacrifice immediate recreational time for the possible eventual rewards of high marks. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schunk argues convincinglythat a reciprocal relationship exists between students&amp;rsquo; goal setting and their perceptions of self-efficacy. When students set intermediate goals for themselves that are specific and proximal in time, they can perceive their learning progress more readily, and this in turn enhances their self-efficacy. Increased self-efficacy can lead students reciprocally to set even more challenging ultimate goals for themselves. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STUDENTS&amp;rsquo; DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-REGULATED LEARNING (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most theorists assume that young children cannot self-regulate their learning in any formal manner (Zimmerman, 1989a). (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their article in this journal issue, Paris and Newman summarize research on developmental changes underlying children&amp;rsquo;s capability to regulate their own learning. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young children rarely reflect on their performance (Skinner, Chapman, &amp;amp; Baltes, 1988), and they believe that trying hard is sufficient to ensure success (Dweck &amp;amp; Elliott, 1983). However, as children approach adolescence, their academic self-perceptions become more accurate (Harter, 1985). They develop an increasingly differentiatedunderstandingof academictasks(e.g., Brown&amp;amp;Smiley,1977),and their monitoring of the differential effectiveness of cognitive strategies for learning grows with age (e.g., Pressley et al., 1984). They gradually realize effort alone will not guarantee success (Nicholls, 1978, 1984). (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paris and Newman hypothesize that these changes depend on children&amp;rsquo;s building personal theories of self-competence, academic tasks, cognitive strategies, motivation, and social cognition in the classroom. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSION (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-regulated learning theories of academic achievement are distinctive from other accounts of learning and instruction by their emphasis (a) on how students select, organize, or create advantageous learning environments for themselves and (b) on how they plan and control the form and (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;amount of their own instruction. Undoubtedly, all learners are responsive to some degree during instruction; however, students who display initiative, intrinsic motivation and personal responsibility achieve particular academic success (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Martinez-Pons, 1988). These self-regulated students are distinguished by their systematic use of metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral strategies; by their responsiveness to feedback regarding the effectiveness of their learning; and by their self-perceptions of academic accomplishment.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter will define self-regulation and will discuss the structure of self-regulatory systems, social and physical environmental context influences on self-regulation, dysfunctions in selfregulation, and self-regulatory development. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A TRIADIC DEFINITION OF SELF-REGULATION (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A social cognitive perspective is distinctive in viewing self-regulation as an interaction of personal, behavioral, and environmental triadic processes (Bandura, 1986). (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selfregulation refers to self-generated thoughts, feelings, and actions that are planned and cyclically adapted to the attainment of personal goals. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This personal agency formulation also differs from metacognitivc views of self-regulation that emphasize only knowledge states and deductive reasoning when, for example, choosing cognitive strategies. Although metacognition plays an important role, self-regulation also depends on self-beliefs and affective reactions, such as doubts and fears, about specific performance contexts (Zimmerman, 1995b). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contextually related selfprocesses, such as perceived efficacy, have been shown to be well suited to explaining variations in personal motivation to self-regulate one’s performance (Bandura, 1997; Pajares &amp;amp; Miller, 1994; Zimmerman, 1995a). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-regulation is described as cyclical because the feedback from prior performance is used to make adjustments during current efforts. Such adjustments arc necessary because personal, behavioral, and environmental factors are constantly changing during the course of learning and performance, and must be observed or monitored using three self-oriented feedback loops (see Figure 1). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioral self-regulation involves selfobserving and strategically adjusting performance processes, such as one’s method of learning, whereas environmental self-regulation refers to observing and adjusting environmental conditions or outcomes. Covert selfregulation involves monitoring and adjusting cognitive and affective states, such as imagery for remembering or relaxing. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, self-regulation involves triadic processes that are proactively as well as rcactively adapted for the attainment of personal goals. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;II. THE STRUCTURE OF SELF-REGULATORY SYSTEMS (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been argued that every person attempts to self-regulate his or her functioning in some way to gain goals in life and that it is inaccurate to speak about un-self-regulated persons or even the absence of self-regulation (Winne, 1997). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a social cognitive perspective, self-regulatory processes and accompanying beliefs fall into three cyclical phases: forethought, performance or volitional control, and self-reflection processes (see Figure 2). Forethought refers to influential processes that precede efforts to act and set the stage for it. Performance or volitional control involves processes that occur during motoric efforts and affect attention and action. Selfreflection involves processes that occur after performance efforts and influence a person’s response to that experience. These self-reflections, in turn, influence forethought regarding subsequent motoric efforts—thus completing a selfregulatory cycle. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. FORETHOUGHT PHASE (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two distinctive but closely linked categories of forethought: (1) task analysis and (2) self-motivational beliefs (see Table 1). (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key form of task analysis involves the setting of goals. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal systems of highly self-regulated individuals are organized hierarchically, such that process goals operate as proximal regulators of more distal outcome goals. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second form of task analysis is strategic planning (Weinstein &amp;amp; Mayer, 1986). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, as a result of diverse and changing intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual conditions, self-regulated individuals must continuously adjust their goals and choice of strategies. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlying forethought processes of goal setting and strategic planning are a number of key self-motivational beliefs: self-efficacy, outcome expectations, intrinsic interest or valuing, and goal orientation. As was noted earlier, self-efficacy refers to personal beliefs about having the means to learn or perform effectively, whereas outcome expectations refer to beliefs about the ultimate ends of performance (Bandura, 1997). (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;self-regulatory efficacy beliefs causally influence use of such regulatory processes as academic learning strategies (Schunk &amp;amp; Schwartz, 1993; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp;amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992), academic time management (Britton &amp;amp; Tcssor, 1991), resisting adverse peer pressures (Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara &amp;amp; Pastorelli, 1996b), selfmonitoring (Bouffard-Bouchard, Parent, &amp;amp; Larivee, 1991), self-evaluation, and goal setting (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Bandura, 1994). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-regulated learners feel self-efficacious in part because they have adopted hierarchical process goals for themselves whose progressive mastery provides them with immediate satisfaction rather than requiring them to suspend any sense of success until a final outcome goal is attained. There is evidence that process goal attainment can become intrinsically motivating in its own right and can even outweigh attainment of superordinatc outcome goals (Schunk &amp;amp; Schwartz, 1993; Zimmerman &amp;amp; Kitsantas, 1997). (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. PERFORMANCE OR VOLITIONAL CONTROL PHASE (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two major types of performance or volitional control processes have been studied to date: self-control and self-observation. Self-control processes, such as self-instruction, imagery, attention focusing, and task strategies, help learners and performers to focus on the task and optimize their effort. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third form of self-control, attention focusing, is designed to improve one’s concentration and screen out other covert processes or external events. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second type of volition or performance control process involves selfobservation. This refers to a person’s tracking of specific aspects of their own performance, the conditions that surround it, and the effects that it produces (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Paulsen, 1995). Although this skill may seem elemental, it is not, because the amount of information involved in complex performances can easily inundate naive self-observers and typically can lead to disorganized or cursory self-monitoring. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-observation can lead to cycles of self-experimentation (Bandura, 1991). When self-observation of natural variations in behavior docs not provide decisive diagnostic information, people can engage in personal experimentation by systematically varying the aspects of their functioning that are in question. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. SELF-REFLECTION PHASE (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bandura (1986) has identified two self-reflective processes that are closely associated with self-observation: self-judgment and self-reactions. Selfjudgment involves self-evaluating one’s performance and attributing causal significance to the results. Self-evaluation refers to comparing selfmonitored information with a standard or goal, such as a sprinter judging practice runs according to his or her best previous effort. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judgments vs. evaluation&lt;br /&gt;
 Interesting distinction highlighted here. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four distinctive types of criteria that people use to evaluate themselves: mastery, previous performance, normative, and collaborative. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;normative criteria involve social comparisons with the performance of others, such as classmates or a national population that was tested. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a collaborative criterion is used primarily in team endeavors (Bandura, 1991). Under these common but more complex circumstances, success is defined in terms of fulfilling a particular role, such as the point guard on a basketball team. The criteria of success for a point guard are different than those used for the other team positions, and how well a point guard can work cooperatively with his or her teammates becomes the ultimate criterion of success. (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogy&lt;br /&gt;
 A potentially fruitful analogy for assessing knowledge building (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-evaluative judgments are linked to causal attributions about the results, such as whether poor performance is due to one’s limited ability or to insufficient effort. These attributional judgments are pivotal to selfreflection, because attributions of errors to a fixed ability prompt learners to react negatively and discourage efforts to improve (Weiner, 1979). (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When self-satisfaction is made conditional on reaching adopted goals, people give direction to their actions and create selfincentives to persist in their efforts. Thus, a person’s motivation does not stem from the goals themselves, but rather from self-evaluative reactions to behavioral outcomes. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adaptive or defensive inferences are conclusions about how one needs to alter his or her self-regulatory approach during subsequent efforts to learn or perform. Adaptive inferences are important because they direct people to new and potentially better forms of performance self-regulation, such as by shifting the goals hierarchically or choosing a more effective strategy (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). In contrast, defensive inferences serve primarily to protect the person from future dissatisfaction and aversive affect, but unfortunately they also undermine successful adaptation. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garcia and Pintrich (1994) have referred to such defensive reactions as self-handicapping strategies, because, despite their intended protectiveness, they ultimately limit personal growth. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;III. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON SELF-REGULATION (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selfinitiated processes alter one’s social and physical environment, and are in turn affected by those changes, such as when a mother puts a note on the refrigerator (an environmental cue) to remind herself or other family members (a social resource) to buy milk. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the seemingly solitary and highly personal craft of writing, there is abundant evidence (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Riscmberg, 1997) of the value of social and physical environmental regulation techniques, such as emulating the styles of exemplary models, soliciting assistance from teachers or confidants, and restructuring the writing setting. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the social and physical environment is viewed by social cognitive researchers as a resource for self-enhancing forethought, performance or volitional control, and self-reflection. Modeling and instruction serve as a primary vehicle through which parents, teachers, and communities socially convey self-regulatory skills, such as persistence, self-praise, and adaptive (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;self-reactions to children. Conversely, when social models demonstrate impulsiveness, self-criticism, or defensive self-reactions, or when social groups reward or accept such actions, a wide array of personal dysfunctions often ensue. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IV. DYSFUNCTIONS IN SELF-REGULATION (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low self-regulatory skill is associated with a wide range of personal problems. For example, there is evidence that students who have trouble self-regulating their academic studying achieve more poorly in school (Zimmerman and MartinezPons, 1986, 1988) and present more deportment problems for their teachers (Brody, Stoneman, &amp;amp; Flor, 1996). (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of social learning experiences is the first important source of self-regulatory dysfunctions. Many forms of self-regulation are difficult to learn by individuals who grow up in homes or communities where they are not taught, modeled, or rewarded. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second personal limitation that leads to dysfunctions in self-regulation is motivational; namely, the presence of apathy or disinterest. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mood disorders, such as mania or depression, are a third personal limitation that can cause major dysfunctions in self-regulation. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth common dysfunction in self-regulation is associated with the presence of learning disabilities, such as cognitive problems in concentration, recall, reading, and writing. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V. DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-REGULATORY SKILL (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is possible to develop self-regulatory competence by personal discovery, this path is often tedious, frustrating, and limited in its effectiveness. (p. 16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, self-regulatory processes can be acquired from and are sustained by social as well as self sources of influence. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a social cognitive perspective (Schunk &amp;amp; Zimmerman, 1997; Zimmerman &amp;amp; Bonner, in press), the acquisition of a wide range of task competencies, from personal care skills to academic learning strategies, emerge in a series of regulatory skill levels. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to strategic skill, models convey associated self-regulatory processes, such as performance standards, motivational orientations, and values that observers can use personally during subsequent developmental phases. (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An observational level of proficiency can be assessed through strategy descriptions or vicarious performance predictions (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Blom, 1983). (p. 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An emulation level of self-regulatory skill is attained when a learner’s behavioral performance approximates the general strategic form of the model. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attainment of a third, self-controlled level of self-regulatory skill occurs when learners master the use of a skill in structured settings outside the presence of models, such as when a pianist can play scales fluidly in the major and minor keys. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A self-regulated level of task skill is achieved when learners can systematically adapt their performance to changing personal and contextual conditions. (p. 18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because selfregulatory skill is context dependent, new performance problems can uncover limitations in existing strategies and require additional social learning experiences. Unlike developmental stage models, this formulation does not assume learners must advance through the four levels in an invariant sequence or that once the highest level is attained, it will be used universally. Instead, like learning hierarchy models, it assumes that students who master each skill level in sequence will learn more easily and effectively. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although level 4 learners have the competence to perform sclf-rcgulatively, they may not choose to do so because of the motivational or contextual factors that were discussed at the outset of this chapter. Intentional forethought, proactive performance effort, and self-reflection arc mentally and physically demanding activities, and a person may decide to forego their use if he or she feels tired, disinterested, or uncommitted. (p. 19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VI. FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, research on the effects of goal shifting during self-controlled learning (Zimmerman &amp;amp; Kitsantas, 1997) needs to be extended to new tasks to determine whether these goal effects are a general or a task-specific phenomenon. (p. 20)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, research also is needed to extend the distinction between the observational and emulation levels to determine if these vicarious learning effects arc general or limited in scope (Kitsantas et al., 1999). (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the distinction between the second (emulation) level and the third (self-control) level should be tested in future research. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these efforts to extend this social cognitive model are successful, they will indicate specifically how human self-regulatory development can be facilitated using social models. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key pedagogical issue regarding socially initiated selfregulatory training is when to withdraw the various forms of modeling support. Although social models are advantageous in conveying high quality methods of task skill, they may inhibit learners from assuming self-direction unless these models are phased out as soon as possible. (p. 21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VII. A CONCLUDING COMMENT (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A social cognitive perspective differs markedly from theoretical traditions that seek to define self-regulation as a singular internal state, trait, or stage that is genetically endowed or personally discovered. Instead it is defined in terms of contextspecific processes that are used cyclically to achieve personal goals. These processes entail more than metacognitive knowledge and skill; they also include affective and behavioral processes, and a resilient sense of selfefficacy to control them. The cyclical interdependence of these processes, reactions, and beliefs was described in terms of three sequential phases: forethought, performance or volitional control, and self-reflection. (p. 22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High achieving students displayed significantly greater use of 13 cate- gories of self-regulated learning (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, several theoretical articles have sought to relate various views of self-regulated learning to academic moti- vation and achievement (Corno &amp;amp; Mandinach, 1983; McCombs, 1984; Schunk, 1984). In the present account, the term self-regulation will be used to describe this general theoretical approach. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By self-regulated learning strategy we mean actions directed at acquiring information or skill that involve agency, purpose (goals), and instrumentality self-perceptions by a learner. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They included goal-setting, environmental structuring, self-consequences (self-rewarding and self-punishment), and self-evaluating. Several other categories were included on the basis of closely allied theoretical formulations—namely, the strategies of organizing and transforming (Baird, 1983; Corno &amp;amp; Mandinach, 1983), seeking and selecting information (Baird, 1983; Wang, 1983), and rehearsal and mnemonic strategies (McCombs, 1984; Paris, Newman, &amp;amp; Jacobs, 1984). Also included were the strategies of seeking social assistance and reviewing previously compiled records such as class notes and notes on text material (Wang, 1983). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present study investigated student use of 14 self-regulation strategies in nonclassroom as well as classroom contexts using a structured interview procedure. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a second goal of the study was to determine the relationship between students&amp;rsquo; reported use of these strategies and an omnibus measure of scholastic accomplishment: their achievement track in school. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hypothesized that students selected from a high achievement track in a public high school would display greater use of self-regulation strategies than students chosen from other (lower) achievement tracks. Greater use of a non-self-regulated strategy was expected by students from the lower achievement tracks. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METHOD (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-Regulated Learning Interview Schedule (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the basis of prior research and theory, 14 classes of self-regulated behavior were identified. In addition, a single category of non-self-regulated behavior (labeled &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo;) was included. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on pilot interviews with high school students from a different community, six different learning contexts were identified: in classroom situations, at home, when completing writing assignments outside class, when completing mathematics assignments outside class, when preparing for and taking tests, and when poorly motivated. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TABLE I Self-Regulated Learning Strategies (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This table is super important. One possibility for the MOOC project is to derive a set of measures for each of those SRL strategies. Even focusing on one would be interesting. (Start from the easier ones&amp;hellip;) (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Categories of strategies Definitions 1. Self-evaluation 2. Organizing and transform- ing 3. Goal-setting and planning 4. Seeking information 5. Keeping records and moni- toring 6. Enviromental structuring 7. Self-consequences 8. Rehearsing and memoriz- ing 9-11. Seeking social assistance 12-14. Reviewing records 15. Other Statements indicating student-initiated evaluations of the quality or progress of their work, e.g., &amp;ldquo;I check over my work to make sure I did it right.&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating student-initiated overt or cov- ert rearrangement of instructional materials to im- prove learning, e.g., &amp;ldquo;I make an outline before I write my paper.&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating student setting of educational goals or subgoals and planning for sequencing, timing, and completing activities related to those goals, e.g., &amp;ldquo;First, I start studying two weeks before exams, and I pace myself&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to se- cure further task information from nonsocial sources when undertaking an assignment, e.g., &amp;ldquo;Be- fore beginning to write the paper, I go to the library to get as much information as possible concerning the topic.&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to re- cord events or results, e.g., &amp;ldquo;I took notes of the class discussion.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I kept a list of the words I got wrong.&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to se- lect or arrange the physical setting to make learning easier, e.g., &amp;ldquo;I isolate myself from anything that distracts me.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I turned off the radio so I can concentrate on what I am doing.&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating student arrangement or imag- ination of rewards or punishment for success or failure, e.g., &amp;ldquo;If I do well on a test, I treat myself to a movie.&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to memorize material by overt or covert practice, e.g., &amp;ldquo;In preparing for a math test, I keep writing the formula down until I remember it.&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to so- licit help from peers (9), teachers (10), and adults (11), e.g., &amp;ldquo;If I have problems with math assign- ments, I ask a friend to help.&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to re- read tests (12) notes (13), or textbooks (14) to prepare for class or further testing, e.g., &amp;ldquo;When preparing for a test, I review my notes.&amp;rdquo; Statements indicating learning behavior that is initi- ated by other persons such as teachers or parents, and all unclear verbal responses, e.g., &amp;ldquo;I just do what the teacher says.&amp;rdquo; (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protocols were coded by two graduate students. Each of the strategies was assigned by a primary judge to one of the 15 categories Hsted in Table I. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three different procedures were used to summarize these categorical data. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the most elemental level, each self-regulation strategy was scored dichoto- mously as having occurred or not during any of the six learning contexts. This measure was called strategy use (SU). A second, more comprehensive measure was termed strategy frequency (SF). This measure consisted of the number of times that a particular strategy was mentioned. (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the most comprehensive level, the students&amp;rsquo; consistency of strategy use was scored. Each method (i.e., self-regulation or other strategy) was weighted by the student&amp;rsquo;s estimate of its freqency of use, a measure termed strategy consistency (SC). (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESULTS (p. 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine which of the three measures of strategy use was optimal in distinguishing between the two achievement groups, a discriminant function analysis (Tatsuoka, 1971) was performed using the total self- regulation scores for each of the usage measures. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he measures revealed substantial differences between the high and low achievement groups, x^ (3) = 81.49, p &amp;lt; .00} It was found that 91 % of the students in the sample could be correctly classified into the high and low achievement groups on the basis of their self-regulated learning measures. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These statistical results indicate that the SC measure was the most effective, although all three disciminant function coefficients were significant (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-three percent of the students could be correctly classified into their respective achievement group on the basis of their use of these 15 categories of self-regulated learning. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These canonical correlation coefficients indicated that the two achieve- ment groups of students were differentiated most by their mention of the self-regulation strategies of &amp;ldquo;seeking information,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;keeping records and (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;monitoring,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;organizing and transforming.&amp;rdquo; (p. 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The present results indicate that a structured interview procedure de- signed to measure student use of self-regulated learning strategies in non- classroom as well as classroom contexts displayed substantial correlation with academic achievement.&lt;/strong&gt; (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;University of Minnesota Libraries on September 12, 2016&lt;/del&gt; (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was found that an interview procedure could provide reliable evidence concerning students&amp;rsquo; self-regulation reports. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data indicate that the SC measure was superior to the other two measures in distinguishing between the two achievement groups of stu- dents. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence that low achieving students reported significantly more non- self-regulated other responses (particularly will power statements) than high achievers indicates that the Self-Regulated Learning Interview in fact assessed individual differences in use of learning strategies, not merely in verbalness. Although it was anticipated that high achievers would be more verbal, the probe procedure was designed to accommodate students who felt reticent about discussing these matters, and the procedure appeared informally to work. Furthermore, the SC measure, which proved to be most effective in differentiating the two achievement groups of students, did not rely simply on verbal description. It differed from the SF measure in its dependence on data from a nonverbal rating scale. Clearly, the results cannot be attributed simply to student verbal fluency. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Self-Regulated Learning Interview Schedule appears to have promise for describing students&amp;rsquo; use of these strategies in natural- istic settings. Like all instruments based on a posteriori self-descriptions of performance and reasoning, it needs to be validated ultimately against students&amp;rsquo; actual performance on academic tasks in naturalistic settings. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present results suggest that theoretical conceptions of students as initiators, planners, and observers of their own instructional experiences have empirical and practical merit. (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, much less commonly discussed are the ethical implications of impersonal data. Examples include, among others, the ‘‘likes’’ on Facebook sold to marketing companies in order to more specifically target certain micro-markets; information generated out of Twitter feed based sentiment analyses for political manipulation of groups, etc. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ethicists have to reconsider some traditional ethical conceptions. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it will briefly outline the traditional ethical principles with regard to moral responsibility. Thereafter, it will summarize four qualities of Big Data with ethical relevance. The third delves deeper into the idea of the changing nature of power and the emergence of hypernetworked ethics; and the fourth section illustrates which ethical problems might emerge in society, politics and research due to these changes.

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its novelty, the very nature of Big Data has an underestimated impact on the individual’s ability to understand its potential (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional ethics (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Big Data are four ethically relevant qualities: (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the enlightenment, traditional deontological and utilitarian ethics place a strong emphasis on moral responsibility of the individual, often also called moral agency (MacIntyre, 1998). This idea of moral agency very much stems from almost religiously followed assumptions about individualism and free will. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is more data than ever in the history of data (Smolan and Erwitt 2012): (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Data is organic: although this comes with messiness, by collecting everything that is digitally available, Big Data represents reality digitally much more naturally than statistical data—in this sense it is much more organic. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the moral agency is determined by several entity innate conditions, three of which are commonly agreed upon (Noorman, 2012): (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Causality: An agent can be held responsible if the ethically relevant result is an outcome of its actions. 2. Knowledge: An agent can be blamed for the result of its actions if it had (or should have had) knowledge of the consequences of its actions. 3. Choice: An agent can be blamed for the result if it had the liberty to choose an alternative without greater harm for itself. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Data is potentially global: not only is the representation of reality organic, with truly huge Big Data sets (like Google’s) the reach becomes global. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correlations versus causation: Big data analyses emphasize correlations over causation. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New advances in ethics have been made in network ethics (Floridi, 2009), the ethics of social networking (Vallor, 2012), distributed and corporate moral responsibility (Erskine, 2004), as well as computer and information ethics (Bynum, 2011). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;distributed morality (Floridi, 2013; Noorman, 2012), which need to be raised (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New power distributions (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four qualities of Big Data (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many books on computer ethics and cyber ethics have been written in the past three decades since, among others, Johnson (1985) and Moor (1985) established the field. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the ethics of Big Data moves away from a personal moral agency in some instances (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, however, the trend is towards an impersonal ethics based on consequences for others. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interaction between these three stakeholders illustrates power relationships and gives us already an entirely different view on individual agency, namely an agency that is, for its capability of morally relevant action, entirely dependent on other actors. One could call this agency ‘dependent agency’ (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in a hyperconnected era, the concept of power, which is so crucial for ethics and moral responsibility, is changing into a more networked fashion. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three categories of Big Data stakeholders: Big Data collectors, Big Data utilizers, and Big Data generators. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more connections A has, the more power he or she can exert. This is referred to as micro-level power and is understood as the concept of centrality (Bonacich, 1987). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of Big Data stakeholders, this could mean that we find these new stakeholders wielding a lot of power: a. Big Data collectors determine which data is collected, which is stored and for how long. They govern the collection, and implicitly the utility, of Big Data. b. Big Data utilizers: They are on the utility production side. While (a) might collect data with or without a certain purpose, (b) (re-)defines the purpose for which data is used, for example regarding: (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ethical Big Data challenges (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Data is the effect of individual actions, sensory data, and other real world measurements creating a digital image of our reality. Cukier (2013) calls this ‘‘datafication’’. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group privacy (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propensity (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie Minority Report painted a vision of a future in which predictions about what people were likely to do could lead to their incarceration without an act committed. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To strip data from all elements pertaining to any sort of group belongingness would mean to strip it from its content. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘‘predictive policing’’ (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Data might induce certain changes to traditional assumptions of ethics regarding individuality, free will, and power. This might have consequences in many areas that we have taken for granted for so long. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Big Data makes the likelihood of random findings bigger—something that should be critically observed with regard to investigative techniques such as RIOT. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research ethics (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethical codes and standards with regard to research ethics lag behind this development. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, ethicists will have to continue to discuss how we can and how we want to live in a datafied world and how we can prevent the abuse of Big Data as a new found source of information and power. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research findings that reveal uncomfortable information about groups (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is the ‘‘informed consent’’: despite the data being already public, no one really considers suddenly being the subject of research in Twitter or Facebook studies. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

Investigating patterns of interaction in networked learning and computer-supported collaborative learning: A role for Social Network Analysis.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is about applying SNA in analyzing CSCL (or networked learning as called in EU). What is unique about this study is it highlights the value of combining SNA with Content Analysis together, and put them both onto a timeline (considering the temporal dimension), to more holistically analyze CSCL processes. In particular, while SNA provides behavioral accounts of interactions (e.g., density of an interaction network and centrality of its individuals), Content Analysis further adds insights about what those behaviors/interactions are all about. In the authors&amp;rsquo; case, CA codes &amp;lsquo;learning&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;tutoring&amp;rsquo; processes in forum posts, whereas SNA provides a picture (or pictures) about the resulting network. While by putting SNA onto a timeline can reveal changes with interactions, insights from CA help explain these changes by putting corresponding learning/tutoring processes into perspective. &lt;strong&gt;Overall, this paper highlights the importance of combining insights from multiple analyses, including CA, SNA, and temporal analysis when understanding CSCL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this paper provides a quite broad review of applying SNA to analyzing CSCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to use these methods to study the nature of the interaction patterns within a networked learning community (NLC), and the way its members share and construct knowledge. The paper also examines some of the current findings of SNA analysis work elsewhere in the literature, and discusses future prospects for SNA. (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;social network (Wellman, 2001) (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Barry Wellman indicated in the magazine Science, “human computer interaction has become socialized. Much of the discussion [&amp;hellip;] is about how people use computers to relate to each other&amp;hellip; [and] has slowly moved from the lone computer user to dealing with (1) how two people relate to each other online, (2) how small groups interact, and (3) how large unbounded systems operate.” (Wellman, 2001, p. 2031). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNA is a research methodology that seeks to identify underlying patterns of social relations based on the way actors are connected with each other (Scott, 1991; Wasserman &amp;amp; Faust, 1997). (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 NL is a U.K. and European term that is used in place of CSCL. We think it is, for practical purposes, synonymous with CSCL and henceforth will refer to them both as NL/CSCL. (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we will discuss (1) how SNA can be used, in general terms, when studying NL/CSCL, and (2) provide a brief account of the application of SNA to a small sample of our own case study data. (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general discussion of Social Network Analysis and NL/CSCL (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of content analysis (Gunawardena et al., 1997; Hara, Bonk, &amp;amp; Angeli, 2000; Henri, 1992) can provide insight into the nature of the content of communication among the participants. This can then augment the perspective gained by using SNA to focus on network connections. These may vary in content, in direction of information flow, and in strength (network connections can be weak or strong, depending on the number of exchanges between participants). (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two key indicators of SNA are “density” and “centrality.” Density provides a measure of the overall ‘connections’ between the participants. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centrality is a measure that provides us with information about the behavior of individual participants within a network. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sociogram is a representation of all participant connections in a social network. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now briefly summarize some recent studies in NL/CSCL that have made use of SNA. (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haythornthwaite, for example, showed that during class communication in a NL/CSCL environment there was a tendency to interact more as teams within the network. Martinez, Dimitriadis, Rubia, Gomez, and de la Fuente (2003) found that the density of a network was affected by the teacher’s presence. Reffay &amp;amp; Chanier (2003) illustrated that SNA can help study the cohesion of small groups engaged in collaborative distance learning as a way to locate isolated participants, active subgroups, and various roles of the participants in the interaction structure. Reuven, Zippy, Gilad, and Aviva (2003) found that in a structured, asynchronous learning network (as opposed to an unstructured open discussion forum) the knowledge construction process reached a high level of critical thinking and the participants developed cohesive cliques. Nurmela et al. (1999) used SNA to study participation in collaborative learning activities such as knowledge building and acquisition. Cho, Stefano, and Gay (2002) used SNA techniques in an educational context to identify central, influential actors in a class. They found, similarly to Beck, Fitzgerald, and Pauksztat (2003), that participants using a discussion board were more likely to follow recommendations made by highly ‘central’ actors than those made by peripheral actors. Daradoumis, (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martinez-Mones, and Xhafa (2004) used SNA to assess participatory aspects, identify the most effective groups and most prominent actors to monitor and assess the performance of virtual learning groups. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of SNA as part of a multi-method case study (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second part of this paper we will present a brief summary of one of our own case studies as an example of how SNA may be used to explore group cohesion and interaction patterns within a networked learning community. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;illustrate how these patterns evolve over time, and attempts to combine these outcomes with the development of teaching and learning processes (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the notion of following interaction patterns over time within Networked Learning Communities has been implemented in several studies. Hara et al. (2000) provide a study in which they conduct a timeline analysis of computer-mediated communication. Howell-Richardson &amp;amp; Mellar (1996) made weekly visual representations of conference activity, based on direct or indirect connections made by the students in their messages. Their analysis was focused on describing interaction patterns when students are assigned to particular roles, and exploring these patterns as they changed over time. Daradoumis et al. (2004) implemented a similar time-line analysis in their research design to track the changes in student participation and group cohesion over time. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haythornthwaite (2001) and Martinez et al. (2003) also concluded that network patterns change and that it is important to study these changes over time. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, in this study we focus on the following questions: 1. How dense is participation within the network and how does this change over time? 2. To what extent are members participating in the discourse and how does this change over time? (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program is hosted in the virtual learning environment called WebCT. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis is based on collaborative project work conducted by seven students and one tutor in the first workshop of this program (approximately 10 week’s duration). In order to make the analysis manageable we sampled the message data from the workshop (approximately 1,000 messages were posted during the task). We divided the 10-week period into three sections: beginning, middle and end. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central purpose of content analysis (CA) is to generalize and abstract from the complexity of the original messages in order to look, in our case, for evidence of learning and tutoring activities. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first coding schema, developed by Veldhuis-Diermanse (2002), was used to code units of meaning that were regarded as “on the task.” These focused on the learning processes used to carry out the task. This schema includes four main categories: cognitive activities used to process the learning content and to attain learning goals; metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive skills used to regulate the cognitive activities; affective activities used to cope with feelings occurring during learning; and, finally, miscellaneous activities. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second schema is used to code units of meaning that are “around the task,” where the focus is on tutoring (Anderson et al., 2001). This schema includes three main sub–categories: design and organization, facilitation of discourse, and direct instruction. (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using WebCT as a source of raw data for SNA (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information retrieved from WebCT logs (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample results of SNA analysis (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning phase, the density is 48%, and for the middle phase the value is 46%. In the last phase of the collaboration the value drops somewhat, to 36%. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high out-degree centralization value indicates that the communication is dominated by some central participants; a low value means that communication is distributed more equally among all the participants. It is interesting to see that while the density drops slightly in the middle, the out-degree centralization goes up. This means that some participants have become more centrally involved compared to the beginning phase. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, this imbalance does not necessarily mean that some participants control the communication by excluding others. It may mean that some participants choose to make fewer contributions to the community during this phase. (p. 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore some answers to the second question, (To what extent are members participating in the discourse and how does this change over time?), we start by presenting the findings of the inand out-degree values for each participant (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using SNA alone, however, does not provide us with a full picture. It is also useful to combine these findings with the outcomes of content analysis to interpret whether central participants, as determined by SNA, are also central to the learning and teaching activity within this group. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When relating the SNA results to the CA (Table 3) we see that Andrea and Charles are responsible for 60% of the learning messages, and that the others (except Bill) are also making a learning input. With respect to tutoring, it seems that Brian and Charles (50%) are responsible for most of this, but all the participants were involved to some extent as well. This leads to the conclusion that although Brian, Andrea and Charles appear to be active participants, they are not entirely dominating the teaching and learning activities of the NLC during this phase. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These general network properties can also be studied more closely using the sociograms. (p. 11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion and discussion (p. 13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the present time, the number of studies available that adopt a research agenda similar to the one outlined here is relatively small. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore crucial to use a combination of content analysis, interviews and social network analysis to understand the teaching and learning processes that are present during NL/CSCL. (p. 14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, what do these social network analysis diagrams and network properties add to what we already know, from previous research (de Laat &amp;amp; Lally, 2003, 2004), about this community? The overall patterns of communication are illustrated in a way that shows the social nature of group learning and tutoring. This dimension was not revealed in content analysis of messages (Table 3) and CER. The diagrams show how people connect to the members in the group, the patterns of collaboration are revealed (one-to-one or many-tomany), and the involvement of individuals in each phase. The findings may be used to seek further explanation for this behavior or can be used to contextualize previous findings about the NL/CSCL activities. However, only by combining SNA with CER and CA can we understand the process and intentions of the participants at the level of individual agencywhat they claim they are doing, why they are doing it and how it occurs through posted messages. By using a time line analysis when studying learning and teaching processes we can also see how certain participants become gradually more active and central figures in their community. (p. 15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我国学者顾小清等[5]也对学习分析 的概念、学习分析技术的发展以及其在未来教育中广泛的应 用前景以及巨大发展潜力做了较为系统的解读。本文将对学 习分析的内涵与外延做进一步的探讨和更加深入的阐释,并 尝试从推动大学教学创新的视角,阐释学习分析技术对促进 大学教学信息化深化发展的重要价值和深远影响。 (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一 学习分析的发展脉络梳理 (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;研究表明,尽管学习分析植根于两个与学习并没有直 接联系的领域,即:商业智能(Business Intelligence)和网站 分析(Web Analytics),其目的是了解组织内部的数据以及外 部的客户行为之间的关系。但是它们在推动学习分析形成的 过程中扮演了举足轻重的角色。&lt;a href=&#34;p. 1&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 学习分析的构成要素 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campbell 和 Oblinger[20]认为学术分析应包含五个步骤: 采集、报告、预测、行动和提炼。 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanya Elias则在Campbell and Oblinger[21]提出的学术分析 五步骤的基础上,提出强调分析过程循环本质的三阶段五个 层面的模型,进一步将学习分析的过程具体为七个步骤,即: 筛选、捕捉、收集和报告、预测、应用、提炼、分享。 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;三 学习分析的过程、工具与方法 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;教育工作者利用数据考核、分析和评估教学和学习已有 悠久历史,随着参与网络学习的人数和支持网络学习活动的 工具种类的剧增,有关学习行为数据的数量不断增多并具多 样性。 (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.学习分析技术的定义 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDUCAUSE 研究机构对学习分析技术的界定是:学习 分析技术就是利用数据和模型,预测学习者在学习中的进步 和表现,预测未来表现和发现潜在问题[12]。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.学习分析技术的要素 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;从纵向发展角度来看,学习分析技术是 CMI 与DDDM 发 展的产物,而从横向发展角度来看,学习分析技术又是网络 分析技术(web analytics)与学术分析技术(academic analytics) 综合应用的结果。 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5)多元化的理论基础。 学习分析技术的理论基础包括 分析理论和实践知识两部分:第一是协同过滤算法、贝叶斯 网络、关联规则挖掘、聚类、基于知识的建议和协同过滤算法 等理论的有效分析方法和技术。 第二是与学习理论、良好的 教学实践、知识共同体的构建、学生的学习动机、毅力和动机 等知识积累的相关领域[17]。 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(二)学习分析技术中的关键技术 (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;伦理问题&lt;br /&gt;
 不知是隐私问题，还涉及ethical use of results (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;隐私问题 (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;学习分析技术所能 够获取的是那些学生的外显行为数据, 由于内隐数据的缺 位,行为数据也许不能反映学生学习的全貌。 如果只分析行 为数据,我们就有重返行为主义学习理论的危险[57]。 (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;五、存在的问题与挑战 (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;责任分担问题 (p. 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LA 在国际上被称为是 “自从学习管理系统 (Learning Management System, 简 称 LMS) 问 世 以 来 , 教育技术大规模发展的第三次浪潮”。 &lt;a href=&#34;p. 1&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四,LA 起源于其他几个已经相对成熟的领域,如 商 务 智 能 (Business Intelligence)、 网 站 分 析 (Web Analysis)、 学 术 分 析 (Academic Analysis)、 行 动 分 析 (Action Analysis)、 教 育 数 据 挖 掘 (Educational Data Mining)、运筹学(Operational Research)[19][20]以及社会网络 分析(Social Network Analysis)等。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;二、学习分析学研究的缘起以及相关技术 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第一个原因是大数据(Big Data)的出现。 [10]Greller 和 Drachsler 认为学习分析学的起源在于网络大数据 的出现,包括政府类数据。 &lt;a href=&#34;p. 2&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siemens 认为, 与 LA 密切相关的是学术分析学 (Academic Analytics, 以下简称 AA)和教育数据挖掘。&lt;a href=&#34;p. 2&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二个原因则可以归结为在线学习或者教育技 术的发展。 [14]随着教育技术的发展,在线学习成为传 LA(学习 统学校教育和终生教育的一个重要模式。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;defition&lt;br /&gt;
 把LA和智慧教育捆绑在一起有意思吗？什么是智慧教育？？？！！ (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第三个原因则与教育机构自身对数据的需求有 关。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;四、LA 的设计研究框架、资源 过程模型及重要环节 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooper 采纳了 Davenport 等对“Analytics ”能够阐释和 回答的问题的总结,[25]并根据其时间线(过去、现在、 将来)和回答的深度(信息型、洞悉型)对问题作了归 类。 &lt;a href=&#34;p. 3&#34;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;issue&lt;br /&gt;
 这完全不是对学习分析学的分析啊！ (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greller&amp;amp;Drachsler 根据他们对学习分析学现存文 献的梳理, 提出了具有六个纬度的 LA 通用设计框 架,即关益者(包括学生用户、教师用户等)、目标(包 括使用数据的目的,如预测等)、数据(包括受限数据 和公开数据等)、工具(分析数据的依据,包括教学理 论等)、外部限制(如用户隐私)、内部限定(包括分析 解读数据结果的能力等)。 &lt;a href=&#34;p. 3&#34;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elias 认为电脑(软硬件技术)、理论、人员和 机构构成了 LA 的四种技术资源,同时也成为 LA 的 核心。 &lt;a href=&#34;p. 4&#34;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;学习分析产生的背景是什么?学习分析与教育数据挖掘的区别如何?学习分析过 程中如何保护个人隐私? (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siemens:学习分析包含丰富的内容,有时 (p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;涉及复杂预测模型,有时涉及日常任务,如课堂 分配和能源保护等。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;那么学习分析与教育数据挖掘 (Education Data Mining,EDM)有什么区别呢? (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;国际教育数据挖掘协会 (International Educational Data Mining Society, IEDMS) 目前正在开展通过设计算法和开发技术来理解学习 过程的工作。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;学习分析从根本上是收集和 测量学生学习过程中产生的数据。然后我们将分析 结果反馈给学习者、研究机构以及教育工作者。我 们的目标是更好地理解学习发生的过程,进而考虑 如何改进学习经历或学习发生的环境,以上就是学 习分析的定义。简单地说,就是分析、揭示学生学 习过程中产生数据所包含的信息。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在温哥华召开的第二届学习和知 识分析国际大会上,强调了教育数据挖掘与学习分 析的联系。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;学习分析是如何产生的呢?我认为有很多原 因,其中最主要的原因是现在可获取的大量数据。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;基于这些学习活动, 我们可以开始构建学习者模型,进而推测哪些学生 可能存在辍学危险;通过评估学生已具备的知识, 我们可以寻找个性化学习的方法,进而帮助学生知 道下一步应该学什么。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;学习分析与教育数据挖掘也存在不同。教育数 据挖掘实际上强调自动发现,因此,它侧重于模型 和发现模式。学习分析尽管也强调自动发现,但同 时还需要人为干预。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我们希望捕捉范围广泛的学习及 学习发生的整个过程。教育数据挖掘侧重于各个组 成部分以及他们之间的关系,不一定采取整体的方 法,而学习分析更关注情境和特定干预。 (p. 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;区分学习分析和教育数据挖掘最好的方法或许 是所依赖的工具和技术。教育数据挖掘重点依赖于 聚类技术,同时也很依赖于智能辅导系统,更加重 视建立模型。而学习分析更加强调社会干预,如社 会网络分析(Social Network Analysis)在学习分析中普 遍应用,话语分析(Discourse Analysis)也很普遍。 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于学习分析, 我们需要考虑如何更好地捕捉环境和情境因素。 (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如何评估学习分析的有效性? (p. 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siemens:学习分析存在很多局限性,目前最 大的缺点是数据收集的范围。目前很多数据来自于 学习管理系统、键盘数据、浏览器数据,基本上都 是学生操作电脑的数据。实际上,很多学习发生在 现实情境当中,但我们并没有捕捉这些发生在现实 情境中的学习过程。 (p. 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandoval, W. A. (2005). Understanding students’ practical epistemologies and their influence on learning through inquiry. Science Education, 89(4), 634–656. doi:10.1002/sce.20065&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;page-9&#34;&gt;Page: 9&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 9
What the above studies and others show is that students at all age levels commonly have
inarticulate ideas about the nature and role of scientiﬁc experimentation, and the relation
between method and theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 9
Methods of Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 9
Although Deanna Kuhn has argued that most children, and even lay adults, fail to distinguish
between theories and evidence (Kuhn, 1993; Kuhn et al., 1988), a number of researchers
have demonstrated that children as young as ﬁve (Sodian, Zaitchik, &amp;amp; Carey, 1991; Tschirgi,
1980) and certainly older students, can in fact distinguish ideas from experiments designed
to test those ideas (Carey &amp;amp; Smith, 1993; Chinn &amp;amp; Brewer, 1998; Koslowski, 1996; Sandoval
&amp;amp; Morrison, 2003; Smith et al., 2000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 9
Science as Constructed. Through middle school, students do not readily acknowledge
that scientiﬁc knowledge is constructed. Younger students tend to report that scientiﬁc
knowledge resides directly in experimental results, whereas older students talk about ideas
as being deﬁnitely right or wrong (Carey et al., 1989; Carey &amp;amp; Smith, 1993; Driver et al.,
1996; Mackay, 1971; Ryan &amp;amp; Aikenhead, 1992). By high school, there is evidence that some
students have developed notions that scientists construct models and theories (Driver et al.,
1996; Lederman &amp;amp; O’Malley, 1990; Solomon, Scott, &amp;amp; Duveen, 1996). Students who have
constructivist notions appear to have more productive science-learning strategies (Hammer,
1994), and perform better in inquiry-oriented environments (Linn &amp;amp; Songer, 1993; Tobin,
Tippins, &amp;amp; Hook, 1995; Windschitl &amp;amp; Andre, 1998).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 9
 The general picture from such studies is that students’ ideas about for-
mal science follow a developmental trajectory toward increasing sophistication throughout
adolescence (Driver et al., 1996; Leach et al., 1997; Mackay, 1971; Ryan &amp;amp; Aikenhead,
1992), but tend to remain fairly na¨ıve through high school or even university instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;page-10&#34;&gt;Page: 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 10
Forms of Scientific Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 10
Students also seem to think of scientiﬁc models in
a common everyday sense, as physical replicas of some aspect of the world, rather than
conceptual systems for explaining phenomena (Grosslight et al., 1991).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 10
Through adolescence, most students seem to be-
lieve that scientiﬁc knowledge is, or at least can be, certain. Students talk about ideas as
either being right or wrong. As instruction tends to focus on what Duschl (1990) calls “ﬁnal
form science,” divorcing ideas from their historical development, most students seem to
believe that old ideas are simply wrong and replaced by newer ideas. For summaries, see
the reviews by (Abd-El-Khalick &amp;amp; Lederman, 2000b; Driver et al., 1996; Lederman, 1992).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 10
Certainty of Scientific Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 10
Most students, even through high school, appear to
believe that hypotheses, theories, and laws are related in a linear hierarchy from less to more
proof. That is, hypotheses are guesses, theories are hypotheses supported by evidence, and
laws have been irrefutably proven (Carey et al., 1989; Ryan &amp;amp; Aikenhead, 1992; Sandoval
&amp;amp; Morrison, 2003; Smith et al., 2000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page: 10
In sum, we do not yet know very much about how students think of the diversity of sci-
entiﬁc methods, because assessments focus exclusively on experimentation as the method
of generating scientiﬁc knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
