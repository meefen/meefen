I am reviewing these two keynotes together because they were both slightly more technical (compared by the third keynote by Alexander) and both about addressing challenges in building models.\nRyan Baker is the founding president of the international society of Educational Data Mining (EDM), a sister community of learning analytics. His talk was focused on six important challenges faced by both EDM and learning analytics. As a keynote it almost sets a future research agenda for the community.\nFirst keynote at #LAK19 by @BakerEDMLab pic.twitter.com/EkrAAOA6qv\n\u0026mdash; Sweet San Pedro (@sweetsp) March 6, 2019 \nChallenges set by ⁦@BakerEDMLab⁩ #lak19 pic.twitter.com/na9aBhwwCa\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) March 6, 2019 \nPredictive models has been a trending topic in the community even though prediction is only one of those five EDM techniques outlined by Baker and Yacef (2009) (see also Siemens, 2013).\nI appreciated Ryan\u0026rsquo;s keynote because it pointed out a few acute problems with our current research and practice. We build models and analytics facing a serious constraint \u0026ndash; the \u0026lsquo;learning system wall\u0026rsquo; problem (Challenge #1). Learning analytics systems we build are not making lasting impact on student lives (Challenge #2). Findings from models are not necessarily interpretable (Challenge #3). We are less confident in detecting student learning in real-world scenarios (say, not in front of a computer) (Challenge #4). Our models are not generalizable across contexts (Challenge #5). Our models are not general either \u0026ndash; not built for a non-typical population (e.g. high school dropouts, Alaska students) (Challenge #6).\nThese important challenges are closely aligned with LAK19\u0026rsquo;s theme, Promoting Inclusion and Access, and vital for the long-term legitimacy of this field. Framing them in technical terms was intended to help us find practical solutions. But I started to feel less optimistic about addressing them within the next 18 years when considering the complex political, ethical, socio-technical, theoretical terrain facing these challenges.\n(Note: Expect Ryan to share more details about these challenges via Twitter soon.)\nThe second keynote by Prof. Lise Getoor was focused on Collective Reasoning as a key challenge in data mining and machine learning. She first called attention to structures in data and critiqued the widespread practice of flattening rich behavioral data into tables. Starting from this recognition, she highlighted that all decisions are structured and argued we should use multimodal, multi-relational, spatio-temporal features of data when making decisions, instead of flattening data and discarding relations.\nGetoor went further to explain Collective Reasoning and suggested constructing logial rules \u0026ndash; many of them \u0026ndash; to further support reasoning.\n.⁦@lgetoor⁩ speaks about the challenge of achieving Collective Reasoning! #lak19 pic.twitter.com/fH7DzjMh8D\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) March 7, 2019 \nHer group developed the Probabilistic soft logic (PSL) framework and toolkit for building probabilistic models.

In the learning sciences, we\u0026rsquo;ve been criticizing the practice of coding-and-counting approach. While part of my research has been trying to cast light on micro-temporal dynamics in learning processes, I am also interested in maintaining the complexity of learning data intact when conducting data analysis. The keynote itself did not provide more details about Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), given the time limit, so I look forward to digging into the PSL framework and tools later.\nLearning Sciences Panel On Wednesday, I moderated a Learning Sciences panel featuring Ryan Baker, Nancy Law (University of Hong Kong), Phil Winne (Simon Fraser University), and Alyssa Wise (New York University). We were charged to inspire the audience with \u0026ldquo;Design and analysis strategies that promote inclusion and increase access\u0026rdquo;. While all of our panelists had very wise things to say, we all concurred we need more expertise represented in the room.\n@bod0ng Important observation about how learning sciences have gone far to help elucidate the political and material conditions affecting learning and what is valued about what we measure in #LearningAnalytics #LAK19\n\u0026mdash; Robin Pappas (@RobinPappas1) March 6, 2019 \nNear the end of the session, one of this year\u0026rsquo;s Doctoral Consortium participants Catherine Manly (UM-Amherst) mentioned her work on Universal Design for Learning.

Besides my own presentation on Value Sensitive Design, I was only able to attend a few sessions on Ethics (which I chaired), Dialogue \u0026amp; Engagement, and Reading Analytics.\nThere were many sessions I wished to attend. And I missed an important talk on the impact of learning analytics, by Shane Dowson and colleagues.\nanalysis of 522 papers thus far in#LAK: simplification, techno-centric, case studies, exploratory\u0026hellip; similar trends in the last several years.. where is learning optimisation? how do we move the field forward in education as a complex system @shaned07 @s_joksimovic #lak19\n\u0026mdash; Sasha (@choux) March 8, 2019 \nFortunately, the conference proceedings are nicely organized by sessions for us to catch up.\nSlides of my talk on Towards Value-Sensitive Learning Analytics Design can be found below.

While we\u0026rsquo;re doing detailed, careful work, it is important to make sure our work is contributing to the betterment of the larger education system. We need to connect models with design, and with feedback. We need to engage more voices in our work. We need to look at choice-making by learners besides knowledge acquisition. We need to connect learning that\u0026rsquo;s life-wide and lifelong. Move towards knowledge convergence. While we can do all sorts of cool analyses on all sorts of interesting data, we need to be an even better job on understanding learning in richer contexts. How can we put advances from multiple analytical perspectives together? Focus on impact. While there are convincing cases of data-rich educational practices, we need to invest more in studying acceptance and impact. Include one keynote speaker from a \u0026ldquo;non-WEIRD\u0026rdquo; country each year. While the society has been doing an amazing job on equity and inclusion, I would like to see a stronger representation from the Global South in the next 10 years. Ensuring voices from \u0026ldquo;non-WEIRD\u0026rdquo; countries could be a good start.  Look forward to seeing you at LAK \u0026lsquo;20 in Frankfurt, Germany.\n","date":1552189515,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552189515,"objectID":"413a806d7da28ce6ce7dfd9ff2b96ec4","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2019-03-08-lak19-part2/","publishdate":"2019-03-09T21:45:15-06:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-03-08-lak19-part2/","section":"post","summary":"(This is the second part of a report of the #LAK19 conference.

This conference, surely one of my favorites, is inching to its 10th anniversary next year. I still remember when I was in the 2nd year of my PhD in 2010, Chris Teplovs told me about an exciting, upcoming gathering of 60~ people in Banff, Canada to discuss a thing called \u0026ldquo;learning analytics.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter nearly a decade of development, we see clear progress this community has accomplished. The growth of the conference size itself, from 60 to 500+ attendees, while impressive, does not speak to the international sensation around this topic. As someone who first attended LAK as a doctoral student in 2014 and now work on a tenure-track position to grow this area at my institution, I can speak to my lived experiences of observing the rise of local interests in this topic (e.g., the \u0026ldquo;R1\u0026rdquo; university I\u0026rsquo;m part of, the state\u0026rsquo;s Department of Education), as well as an international passion for learning analytics when I travel to Singapore, Manila, and Beijing.\nThe rise of learning analytics (the field), LAK (its conference) and SoLAR (its society), coincides with many other things. In education, there is a push for \u0026ldquo;evidence-based practice\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;data use\u0026rdquo; in schools (however we mean by evidence or data). In EdTech, words like A.I., adaptive learning, personalization are mentioned in board rooms, websites of philanthropist foundations, and news headlines. Of course, an earlier surge of MOOCs and an ongoing rise of online, lifelong learning demand analytic supports while also offering fertile grounds for learning analytics to grow. In many cases, learning analytics are truly needed and making impossible things possible. But in others, it\u0026rsquo;s scooped up to be a tag on a product to drive sales.\nRealities, for better or worse, just like many other fields we can think of.\nOverall impression of LAK19 First of all, many thanks to the amazing organizing team who has done a wonderful job to make everything real and enjoyable! The program is cohesively organized; conference amenities are thoughtfully arranged; student volunteers are kind and amazingly helpful. These are on top of myself escaping -30C weather in Minnesota for the 20C dessert temperature.\nThanks #LAK19 Defrosting in progress. pic.twitter.com/C1lPgc52XE\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) March 4, 2019 \nAs the community grows bigger, I always found multiple concurrent sessions/talks I hoped to check out. So my impression and report of this conference are surely biased.\nMonday: Full-Day Workshop on Connectivism I went to this workshops mainly for jokes among Canadians, Aussies, and Serbians :). I was sorted of disappointed because Vita was clearly jet-lagged.\nJokes aside, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a big fan of Connectivism, George Siemens, and Stephen Downes for years. Many ideas under Connectivism resonate with me, as a big part of my research is grounded in the Knowledge-Building Community model created by Scardamalia and Bereiter.\nGeorge kicked off the workshop by briefly explaining its 15-year history. Connectivism emerged in the early stage of the Read/Write web (Web 2.0) and grew out of a dissatisfaction with existing frameworks of learning that were not very helpful in explaining the construction of \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; knowledge in a networked world.\nThe core arguments made by Connectivism are:\n Knowledge is networked. This idea is in line with works from Rosen (2012), combinatorial creativity, Nielsen (2013), and Borner (network of science). Learning is the process of developing those networks. These two ideas apply beyond learning.  At this workshop, George challenged us to work on three domains where learning is networked: Neural; Cognitive/Conceptual; and Social/External. Future work on Connectivism should try to deliver quality empirical research about networks of learning at these levels, detail how things fit together, integrate networks across levels, and articulate human and artificial cognition.\nCritiques of Connectivism as a learning theory were mentioned for multiple times. It\u0026rsquo;s probably accurate to say George found these critiques fair and highlighted that Connectivism meant to provide a framework (or paradigm) to think about knowledge and learning in a fresh way. There is a vast empty space left by Connectivism, including pedagogy, learning analytics, etc.\nStephen Downes joined the workshop remotely and shared a very informative review* of recent work on connectivism. His review looked at scholars\u0026rsquo; various interpretations of connectivism, criticisms, connectivism as pedagogy (e.g., Wang, Anderson, \u0026amp; Chen 2018), connectivism as a theory of learning, and properties of a successful network. He offered a number of future directions, including critical thinking and deep learning (not the ML sense), rhizomatic learning, social networking, and cognitive cities. Listening to such a review from one of the creators was helpful.\n(*: As a strong advocate of open scholarship, Stephen may have chosen to focus this review on open-access publications.)\nComing into this workshop, I was looking for two things:\n Conceptually, I was wondering why many research papers on cMOOCs used frameworks such as the Community of Inquiry to examine connectivist learning instead of connectivism itself. I was curious about further articulation of connectivism. In terms of design \u0026ndash; of both connectivist learning environments and analytics \u0026ndash; I was looking for design principles and design ideas to inform some of our ongoing projects.  Four principles of connectivism Stephen laid out later was quite useful. These principles include:\n Autonomy of learners Diversity of learners, ideas, information, etc. Openness of the environment and process. Interactivity within the network.  I found these principles valuable even though more work is needed to further unpack and articulate them. Stephen predicted a shift is going to happen (if not yet) even if it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily tagged with connectivism.\nAt the workshop, there were several interesting research talks as well, including analyzing group communication (Nia Dowell), assessing idea development using epidemiological modeling (Sasank Peri), and modeling network dynamics (Renzhe Yu). They represented promising directions to further advance connectivism, especially in the areas of analyzing connective learning processes and developing automated indices about connective learning. Srećko Joksimović also presented findings from an ongoing bibliometric study of the connectivism literature. More details can be found on the workshop website.\nI very much appreciated the multi-level network view laid out by George and his urge for us to connect levels. These ideas are informative for my recent thinking, tinkering, and design (since 2017) to:\n Represent, describe, and model learning (at multiple levels) as complex networks Design tools for personal, connectivist learning that give learners agency to maintain their networks Brainstorm an analytical infrastructure that maintains complexity of all sorts of learning processes  Attending this workshop was a treat!\nTuesday: Workshop on Fairness It was an honor to give an invited talk about Value-Sensitive Design in learning analytics at the FairLAK workshop organized by Kenneth Holstein and Shayan Doroudi.\nIt is a timely workshop that deals with a topic that\u0026rsquo;s critical for our work in this community and beyond. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know there are 21 fairness definitions (Narayanan, 2018; Youtube video). During my limited time spent at the workshop, it is refreshing to see multiple approaches to considering fairness, ranging from creating new metric based on slice analysis to evaluate fairness in predictive models (Josh Gardner), to applying the Socio-Technical Integration Research approach to design processes.\nThe program and slides of the FairLAK workshop can be found on its website.\nTuesday: Workshop on Curriculum Development in LA Programs Stephanie Teasley and John Stamper asked me to stop by another workshop about curriculum development in learning analytics. It was half-way through after coming from the FairLAK workshop.\nCharles Lang and Leah Macfadyen showed us their informative reviews of degree programs related to learning analytics. John Stamper showed us CMU\u0026rsquo;s Master\u0026rsquo;s Educational Technology and Applied Learning Science program that interestingly integrates courses from different disciplines and connects deeply with the industry.\nFollowing Charles\u0026rsquo; lead, we even got a chance to co-design a class activity to engage students to consider and experience themselves as data producers, data analysts, and analytics consumers. I believe nurturing criticality in all course of a learning analytics program is critical. Interesting activities like this could be very helpful.\nWe discussed collectively mapping out a learning analytics curriculum. Workshop leaders will be working on compiling a list of courses and syllabi to be shared on the SoLAR website. I look forward to being part of this important work.\nOther Pre-Conference Workshops There were many interesting workshops happening at LAK.\nThe Writing Analytics workshop has generously shared their notes that I look forward to dig into. Mladen Rakovic from SFU channeled some \u0026ldquo;knowledge telling vs. knowledge transforming\u0026rdquo; wisdom (Bereiter \u0026amp; Scardamalia) I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with.\nWriting analytics for helping students move from knowledge telling to knowledge transforming in writing #WaLAK19 #LAK19 @MladenRakovic pic.twitter.com/TIb20hWbRl\n\u0026mdash; Shibani Antonette (@ShibaniAntonett) March 4, 2019 \nThe Doctoral Consortium seemed to be going strong as well!

The first study applied Value Sensitive Design methods, specifically stakeholder analysis and value analysis, to a conceptual investigation of an existing learning analytics tool. This investigation uncovered a number of values and value tensions, leading to design trade-offs to be considered in future tool refinements. The second study holistically applied Value Sensitive Design to the design of a recommendation system for the Wikipedia WikiProjects. To proactively consider values among stakeholders, we derived a multi-stage design process that included literature analysis, empirical investigations, prototype development, community engagement, iterative testing and refinement, and continuous evaluation. By reporting on these two studies, this paper responds to a need of practical means to support ethical considerations and human values in learning analytics systems.

Jeremy Dean from Hypothes.is chimed in on Authorea later in Jan 2018 and we eventually met in June 2018 at the I Annotate conference in San Francisco.\nOn April 22, 2018, after going through two rounds of revisions (with great comments from reviewers and the editor), the article was publised \u0026ldquo;Online First\u0026rdquo; in TechTrends.\nTill now, October 2018, this article is still in its \u0026ldquo;Online First\u0026rdquo; status and may get included in an issue next year. However:\n its first version on Authorea has been annotated 24 times its OSF preprint has been downloaded 89 times its Springer \u0026ldquo;Online First\u0026rdquo; version has been downloaded 89 times, shared 14 times, and annotated 43 times  From its inception in 2017 to its \u0026ldquo;formal\u0026rdquo; appearance in a printed issue in 2019, a whole lot has happened to this particular work. Indeed, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent extra hours to make things work (e.g., converting between document formats, uploading to OSF). But this journey, which I did not anticipate in the beginning, has been extremely rewarding. This article may not be my seminal work, but it is reassuring that by doing bits and pieces related to Open Access, we as researchers can (1) receive feedback from a broader audience, (2) make valuable connections with colleagues, and (3) get our work read and discussed \u0026ndash; much earlier than its formal publication.\nVoicing the Stance Despite the power of Open Access \u0026ndash; and more broadly, Open Scholarship \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced so far, it is unfortunate some disciplines and some tenure committees (not mine) would bluntly equate Open Access with \u0026ldquo;lesser quality.\u0026rdquo; The tyranny of metrics is worth a separate post. But here I want to share a statement related to Open Access I decided to include in my dossier (as a tenure-track professor):\n As an interdisciplinary scholar, I seek to publish in refereed journals from various fields of research, including learning sciences, educational technology, educational psychology, and learning analytics.\nAs an advocate of Open Scholarship, I also attempt to balance my publication venues between “traditional” journals and quality open-access alternatives.\nAs a scholar with Chinese heritage, I also write for audiences who speak my mother tongue.\n Despite 10 years of #OpenAccessWeek, we still have a long way to go to make \u0026ldquo;Invisible Labour\u0026rdquo; in Open Scholarship visible and valued. This is a sudden realization I had this year, thanks to the tweet below.\n#OAweek event in Vancouver BC Canada: Open but not free: Invisible Labour in Open Scholarship. pic.twitter.com/aNz8txzD1c\n\u0026mdash; Christina Hendricks (@clhendricksbc) October 25, 2018 \nWhile I will continue to do those \u0026ldquo;bits and pieces,\u0026rdquo; I will especially try to be a strong adavocate for: (1) valuing work published in many quality open-access journals, and (2) crediting labor put into Open Scholarship \u0026ndash; including Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data (according to SPARC) \u0026ndash; in tenure or performance review committees.\nMore broadly, we need changes with institutional culture, re-imagined writing and publishing practices (like PubPub), and better Open Scholarship infrastructure (like the Open Science Framework, ICPSR, and Open Web Annotation).\nI wonder how things may look like in 2028!\n","date":1540601298,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540601298,"objectID":"55725b98513442bc4e212b06322223e2","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2018-10-oa-week/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T19:48:18-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-10-oa-week/","section":"post","summary":"This week is the Open Access Week 2018.

He built a wiki-based workflow system, named researchr, and convinced a few OISE friends, including Cresencia Fong and Alisa Acosta, to share our annotations publicly, in a well-organized manner. For us, the benefits of using researchr are obvious: the system scaffolds the scholarly process of reading and annotating articles, as well as summarizing and organizing our notes. Its openness adds another important piece that\u0026rsquo;s a bit murkier. What does it mean to share out annotations publicly \u0026ndash; to academics who annotate, to authors of an annotated article, and to academia?\nMeeting with Pratim Sengupta, whose work was annotated by myself when running a journal club with a dozen grad students, just gave me a chance to really ponder on these questions. He and his team\u0026rsquo;s work on public computing inspires my evolving thinking on the value of openness.\nMy thinking is also contextualized in my recent attendance to the I Annotate conference and the idea of creating \u0026lsquo;A Coalition for Scholarly Annotation\u0026rsquo; shared by Jon Udell. My key takeaway from the conference was that the web annotation community has been thinking deeply about web information, knowledge and workflows. Their work has generated nascent web standards, tools and practices that are making an impact on publishing, information \u0026lsquo;consumption\u0026rsquo;, and human collaboration on the web.\nNow enters this blog post This post will be an evolving document reflecting my ongoing thinking on open scholarly annotation. Writing this blog post is a new experiment. I admit my bias upfront. That is, I strongly believe scholarly annotations generated at various stages of the scholarly process are of great value. However, these annotations have become part of the \u0026lsquo;dark data\u0026rsquo; generated by scholars and are rarely talked about. While research reproducibility has been embraced by many disciplines and scholarly communities, how we actually \u0026lsquo;annotate\u0026rsquo; each other\u0026rsquo;s ideas into new ones remains opaque. Remaining in the dark is not doing justice to hidden value we produce as scholars and is not helping with the training of emerging scholars. Further enriching openness in scholarly practices \u0026ndash; even beyond open data and analysis reproducibility \u0026ndash; would be a meaningful next step.\nPhase 1 of writing this post In Phase 1, I will publicly annotate web documents about open scholarly annotation, using Hypothes.is and a tag ValueAnnotation. Below is an evolving collection of my annotations, and I invite you to annotate with me using the same tag.\n --  Here is an example of a Hypothesis annotation I created.\nPhase 2 This is an emerging process. The next step, as I see now, is to make sense of generated annotations and update this post with summaries and new ideas that \u0026lsquo;rise above\u0026rsquo; existing ones.\nUpdate (2018-7-20): In preparation for an AERA 2019 submission, I wrote a research summary describing what I hope to do next.

I am not knowledgeable enough to explain why. But I had lived experiences with buying bulky textbooks for $200 and using them as laptop stands after a single use. They are from respected textbook publishers (like SAGE) and are indeed well-written. But \u0026hellip; there could be 100 reasons why a textbook should not cost that much.\nMore importantly, the notion of ‘a textbook’ has evolved, at least for some disciplines. In many fields that are fast-evolving, textbooks written today will become dated in two years. Also, one textbook can rarely fulfill needs of a course, making it necessary to introduce fresh texts and multimedia content from the ‘open world’. Digital tools, such as H5P and Colaboratory, offer richer modalities, interoperability, and interactivity for learning in comparison with traditional paper books.\nMore profoundly, the conceptualization of a textbook as a container of knowledge to be acquired by students is challenged by ‘new cultures of learning’ that de-emphasize ‘knowledge as stocks’ and value learning as \u0026lsquo;participating in a flow of knowledge production\u0026rsquo;. Instructors can surely do inspiring things with a traditional textbook, but grounding principles of Open Educational Resources (OER) almost automatically make a philosophical statement that draws one’s teaching closer to new cultures of learning. It’s the (promised) paradigm shift behind OER (and open textbooks) that attracts me, besides cost concerns mentioned above.\nAnd, by the way, these changes are not limited to textbooks, but also scholarly knowledge production in general.\nOpen educational practices So my thinking on OER are tilted towards ‘open educational practices’. In addition to making my course content open (on Github for example), I am also interested in:\n Open participation — that does not limit participation within a socially, spatiotemporally, and technologically bounded environment Student agency and voice — that give students a say about what to learn and how to learn Connected learning and networked scholarship opportunities — that present a fuller picture of learning  In a design case I recently published in TechTrends, an EdTech journal, I introduce in great details about a course I designed with these ideas in mind. I wrote a course handbook, which is essentially a compilation of OER, and incorporated tools like Hypothes.is and Slack to facilitate collaborative discourse.\nIt would be fun to integrate more ‘open pedagogy’ ideas in the next iteration of this course. Maybe asking students to rewrite the handbook. Maybe setting up open Jupyter Notebooks for students to fork, remix, and redistribute.\nWhat does this mean for faculty members? \u0026quot;use their free time\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;on top of their day-to-day work, often only receiving relatively small grants as compensation\u0026quot; 🤔 Bit problematic framing of OER production, as if it\u0026#39;s done by amateurs, out of love.\n\u0026mdash; Ewout ter Haar (@ewout) April 19, 2018 \nIt’s a good critique. Free-time is an unfamiliar word for many academics. The idea of teaching online is already facing push-backs over the years. Structural supports for faculty members are needed to make OER production sustainable. Supporting broader acceptance of OER and open educational practices also requires cultural shifts within an institution, which is often hard to bring about.\n","date":1524528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524528000,"objectID":"f12a9bdc67e7bf82262f3297acc8f5db","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2018-04-24-open-textbooks/","publishdate":"2018-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-04-24-open-textbooks/","section":"post","summary":"I was included in an MN Daily story about open textbooks last week.

The intimate connection between us with screens has been built into another piece of technology.\n(Image Source)\n\u0026ldquo;Say Something in English\u0026rdquo; On a workday, my pre-schooler son and I were playing in a playground in Shanghai. There were a bunch of other kids \u0026ndash; mostly younger \u0026ndash; also playing there. My son always prefers talking with me in Mandarin but may entertain with a few English words from time to time. Then there was a dad with his young daughter (approximately 2 years old). It didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for him to make a request to his daughter: \u0026ldquo;Baby, can you say something in English?\u0026rdquo; The same thing happened again the next day in a park.\nA few days later when I was in my hometown, a small town in Western China, I visited a newly built factory where an uncle works. This factory manufactures food supplements with nutritions extracted from traditional Chinese herbs. I somehow ended up meeting with their young sales team, which was made of four fresh college graduates. They were in their early 20s, and two of them graduated from the same high school I attended. Then I began to learn about their goals of taking over their international sales from intermediaries located in costal areas. They were not confident in their English capabilities though and showed tremendous interests in Western culture(s).\nMy biggest dream while growing up in my hometown was to go to college in Shanghai or Beijing. Now it seems people living in my hometown are aspiring to ride the tide of globalization. It may be still difficult to attract or retain necessary talents. But they have lofty goals. The new factory aims to become a listed company in 15 years.\n\u0026ldquo;I accept both WeChat and Zhifubao\u0026rdquo; Riding on a taxi from Shanghai Pudong Airport to a hotel, I noticed two QR codes attached to the dashboard of the taxi.\n\u0026ldquo;I accept both WeChat and Zhifubao,\u0026rdquo; said the driver when we arrived. And he taught me how to use them on the fly.\nThis time around, I could basically go cash-free everywhere in China.\n\u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t see the point.\u0026rdquo; During my stay at Beijing Normal, I taught a few classes on topics such as MOOCs and learning analytics. In a graduate-level class, a professor introduced to us a project aiming to build a recommender engine to help highschool students choose subjects in the newly reformed college entrance exam. The recommender engine will be based on a wide range of factors, including previous performance, personality traits, competitiveness of the student\u0026rsquo;s aspired college, and so on.\nOne student said, \u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t see the point.\u0026rdquo; Her argument was this choice is too high-stake and too personal. She would like to make the choice on her own even if the recommendation is meant to be informational.\nShe had a point.

In particular, students reported usefulness of the toolkit for monitoring posting behaviors and setting participation goals. Content analysis of post content linked tool usage with students' increased attempts to solicit peer responses to their posts and increased reflection on individual participation. However, the tool was not found useful or easy to use by some students, and it did not show benefits in other aspects of online discussion, such as crafting stronger argumentation or reflecting on group processes.

In Part II of my personal reflection, I summarize key Data Sharing resources/initiatives to be aware of, possible action items, and some personal random thoughts on future directions.\nThe 3-day workshop on \u0026quot;Data Sharing and Research Transparency at the Article Publishing Stage\u0026quot; comes to a close today in D.C. pic.twitter.com/XpXIKp459g\n\u0026mdash; AERA (@AERA_EdResearch) July 27, 2017 \nData Sharing in Education Science: The Status Quo On the second day of the workshop, scholars working at the frontiers of data sharing and open science presented their insights and experiences, together with officers from funding agencies (IES, NSF, NIH) and journal editors.\nSkip Lupia (UMich), a political scientist and the Chairman of the Board of the Center for Open Science, gave a talk about Why Share, Why Now, What for?. He helped us unpacking two important criteria of scientific research: credibility and legitimacy. Equally helpful was a recognition that transparency encompasses production transparency (the production of data) and analytic transparency (how a scholar goes from data to knowledge claims). He shared important resources from the DA-RT: Data Access and Research Transparency initiative and its TOP Guidelines, supported by 29 top journals across disciplines. He shared preliminary evidence of \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; things like the CoS Badges can effectively spur the adoption of data sharing \u0026amp; research transparency practices. Finally, it was so refreshing to hear that those data sharing initiatives have been and are being championed by qualitative researchers. Data sharing is indeed doable for qualitative researchers and how qualitative researchers perceive data (and I guess more specifically their ontological and epistemological commitments) are of great value to data sharing practices. This is a very important and mindbolging message that I did not expect before this workshop.\nThree recognized data sharing repositories \u0026mdash; Inter‐university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) (UMich), Databrary (PSU \u0026amp; NYU), and Qualitative Data Repository (QDR) (Syracuse) \u0026mdash; and their leaders/PIs presented as a panel. It was encouraging to see: 1) ICPSR\u0026rsquo;s long record of data sharing/archiving since 1962; 2) QDR as a repository focusing on qualitative data; and 3) \u0026ldquo;even\u0026rdquo; research videos are also sharable on Databrary. AERA is partnering with ICPSR to set up a dedicated repository for AERA journals, in line with AERA\u0026rsquo;s forthcoming policies on data sharing. Important questions were asked about possible impact on international researchers \u0026mdash; and non-WEIRED populations \u0026mdash; who are automatically excluded by some data repositories\u0026rsquo; requirements of IRB approvals that are nonexistent in some countries/regions. For me, it was encouraging to learn existing templates and guidelines made available by data sharing repositories that I could refactor for IRB protocols of my projects. Together with emerging policies made by funding agencies, professional associations, and journals, I can feel more confident about pursuing data sharing (as much as possible) when proposing a study.\nIt was exiting to hear from Maggie Levenstein (Director of ICPSR) about work on researcher credential building blocks that\u0026rsquo;s under way. Their framework of credentials includes a researcher\u0026rsquo;s status (incl. academic, geographic, demographics), affiliation, training (e.g., in data sharing), access level, prior contributions, and violations of data stewardship. While companies like ResearchGate are inventing scores to determine researchers\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;status,\u0026rdquo; why not build a non-proprietary system to enable positive feedback loop for data sharing? A researcher credentialing system with an emphasis on data sharing could raise awareness of data sharing, give credits to those who share, and maintain reputation of data users. Exciting stuff!\nOf course, there are still so many issues to be sorted out, especially from an editor\u0026rsquo;s standpoint, who may constantly face work overload and not wish to add another layer to a journal\u0026rsquo;s production pipeline. Extremely legitimate. As an early career scholar, I\u0026rsquo;m quite blind to many challenges an editor or an association\u0026rsquo;s president might be thinking about. Fortunately colleagues running data repositories may have a lot to offer.\nIt was helpful to hear from Lupia on the third day about multiple levels and multiple dimensions a journal can consider when implementing data sharing practices. Check out this one-pager explaining 8 modular standards and 3 levels. From the lowest level, for example, a journal could encourage \u0026mdash; instead of requiring \u0026mdash; authors to put data into a repository. In terms of dimensions, a journal could consider change of citation practices to reinforce secondary datasets being cited, require preregistration of (causal-inferential) research, encourage replication studies, nurture analytic transparency by asking authors to share code, and so forth. As our JLS co-editor-in-chief Susan Yoon nicely worded, \u0026ldquo;it seems the train has already departed, and we need to catch it.\u0026rdquo; I was thinking about a slightly different metaphor based on my experiences playing \u0026ldquo;Real-Time Strategy Games\u0026rdquo;: there are multiple pathways towards winning a game (e.g., defeating an opponent), and doing one thing (such as collecting a lot of lamber) may unlock other components of winning; further, in a game that requires teamwork, one player (e.g., a journal editor) could focus on one component (e.g., collecting lamber) and share to teammates, while other teammates (e.g., community advocates, data repositories) could handle other parts. We should not drain an editorial team\u0026rsquo;s limited resources to achieve everything overnight; rather, maybe we could create a roadmap that involves multiple types of contributors \u0026mdash; authors, editors, data sharing services, funders, and maybe also publishers (for-profit or not).\nFunding agencies have been actively looking into data sharing. For instance, discussions on data and data stewardship are central to NSF Programs such as smart and connected communities and Internet of Things. NIH has 71 data repositories and is very active in Genomic data sharing. To a great extent, broader impacts sought by funding agencies could become more achievable if research data \u0026mdash; collected with support from tax-payer dollars \u0026mdash; are not sitting in one team\u0026rsquo;s private server for 10 years but instead shared carefully, ethically, and with proper restrictions.\nLike a colleague nicely said:\n Data sharing is not a thing in addition to doing science. Data sharing is doing science.\n Action Items A collective resolution has been reached near the end of the workshop and is likely to be shared by AERA soon. Below are action items that seem to me thinkable \u0026mdash; if not yet feasible \u0026mdash; for different players.\n(Disclaimer: These items are in many cases my personal takeaways and do not represent official policies from funding agencies or professional associations. Some ideas are based on group discussion but may not accurately reflect what was originally said.)\nIndividual researchers. Study issues related to research transparency, reproducibility, replicability, etc. Get familiar with terms like p-hacking, preregistration, reproducible research, preprints, Research Objects, etc. Take a hard look at our own research workflows and think about potential transparency/reproducibility hazards \u0026mdash; which could be related to how we name files, store research memos, document R codes, backup data, etc. Stay current with existing data sharing guidelines from funders, journals, and research societies \u0026mdash; as the train has ignited its engine if not yet departed. Seek support from our institutions, libraries, data stewards, etc. For those ahead of the game, publish your codes in Github, package algorithms in an R package, etc.\nA very important point made by Robyn Read (an early career peer \u0026amp; also an OISE alumnus): academia has been quite intolerant of failures and mistakes. We get afraid of missteps at every stage of a research project. How about making peer-review more collaborative? How about putting drafts/preprints out there early on for open discussions (see this paper originally shared as a draft)? There are certain norms in academia possibly ripe for disruption (a word I typically don\u0026rsquo;t like using).\nFaculty members. Engage students in conversations, in our labs or methodology courses. Point them to training resources on campus or online (webinars, MOOCs, manuals). Help them stay calm, even when we aren\u0026rsquo;t :-). Maybe even develop new courses about research transparency and reproducible research \u0026mdash; typically nonexistent in colleges of Education.\nReproducibility Guide from the R and rOpenSci communities https://t.co/e7DA5PP16h #DataSharing #openscience\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) July 26, 2017 \nProfessional associations and their journals. Convey messages to association members and share exemplars. Expect non-supportive reactions and resistance. Treat resistance as good opportunities of conversations, as a colleague said. Engage members \u0026mdash; esp. international members \u0026mdash; in conversations about data sharing at board meetings, conferences, webinars, doctoral consortia, etc. Talk with other journals under a same society, journals in a same field by \u0026ldquo;reside\u0026rdquo; somewhere else, and journals from other fields. Identify early-starters of data sharing and engage them in training and conversations. Maybe consider a new award category for data sharing or research transparency/reproducibility (suggested by Skip).\nData repositories. I look forward to digging into datasets already living in those repositories and studying their resources for IRB preparation. For example, to me knowing data sharing is not the same as making data totally open to anyone was helpful (see the tweet below). It would be very useful if data repositories could further provide dataset exemplars. A 3-minute video walkthrough about the process of depositing a dataset will also help. These resources would help us get a more concrete understanding of data sharing.\nOne example ICPSR dataset showing ways to protect data: the words #DataSharing sound scary but there are strategies https://t.co/MfZqqUSWxf pic.twitter.com/FUpfc3SZNh\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) July 26, 2017 \nUniversities and research institutions. IRB practices are evolving as well. My institution, the University of Minnesota, hosted IRB Town Halls last academic year discussing the changing landscape of Compliance \u0026amp; Ethics. Engage IRB offices in data sharing conversations, if not yet. Also important is a university\u0026rsquo;s willingness to back up its researchers\u0026rsquo; ethical data sharing practices and stand with them against possible vicious attacks. Just like many universities are backing up their faculty members\u0026rsquo; fair-use claims.\nTowards My Dream World This workshop was so helpful in getting me to think more deeply about data sharing and possible actions I can take as a researcher, faculty member, new investigator, author, international person whose home country\u0026rsquo;s ethical review practice is still emerging.\nBelow I explore a few other components touched upon (implicitly) during the workshop. I am quite excited about them even though they are still vague and paradoxical to me, or are totally against our current norms and routines. So I\u0026rsquo;m now throwing them out there for further discussions.\nControl. Before attending the workshop, I thought data sharing is to put data out there \u0026mdash; totally public and totally beyond one\u0026rsquo;s control after data get shared. That is a scary scene for many of us. As researchers, we can still remain a certain level of control over a shared dataset \u0026mdash; not based on whether we like a data requester or whether a requested usage contradicts our published findings.. But it seems controls pre- and post-sharing are areas that could be further discussed.\nHere I\u0026rsquo;m especially curious about possible controls after data sharing (post-sharing). Linked to work on researcher credentials, data repositories could have an opportunity to think twice about a data request from someone with many previous violations. For data sharers, they may wish to be able to track who are accessing my shared data, how, and where results are published; so are data repositories.\nRelated to post-sharing controls, we also image a shared dataset to keep evolving after secondary analysts invest time to recode, reshape, or link them. When we allow a new version of a dataset to appear? Or do we allow a dataset to fork? Who can make these judgements? Intriguing questions.\nHow about research participants? While our currently practices seek clearcut delimiters of data ownership/stewardship in a lifecycle of project. For example, when an informed consent is made, we say data ownership is transferred from a participant to a researcher; similarly, when a dataset gets submitted to shared to a repository after de-identification, we see another change of data ownership and stewardship. However, in a deeply connected world, should research participants remain control of their own data? Would it be more ethical if participants have the choice to stay aware of work conducted on data they contributed \u0026mdash; while remaining hidden from data users? This may seem totally quite counter-intuitive. But see yourself the Kavli HUMAN project, the shift from an Internet of Information to an Internet of Actions, and a move to store medical records on blockchains.\n Ubiquitous networking has transformed cyberspace into a pervasive layer atop our physical reality. (source)\n What\u0026rsquo;re the implications on research data? What does it mean to data sharing?\nLinked data and maintained contexts. Information loss accompanies the lifecycle of research data \u0026ndash; from collection, cleansing, transformation, analysis, synthesis, publication, to meta-analysis\u0026hellip; We are increasingly losing the context where data were originally collected. In a \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; connected world, as described above, how about data sharing is not too distant from where data originally reside? Data sharing is just like adding faces and masks to data and selectively expose data to secondary users? In my experiences with secondary data, I saw data shared in forms PDFs, CSVs, Excels, JSONs, and XMLs. How about we say those data formats or shapes all suck, and we wish to (safely \u0026amp; ethically) maintain possible connectivity when sharing data instead of cutting connections?\nBroader conceptions of value and incentives. I shared an idea in a breakout group discussion about crediting data sharers with a crypto- or digital currency, with which they can \u0026ldquo;purchase\u0026rdquo; other data. Like the Ethereum blockchain, data sharers share data with \u0026ldquo;smart contracts\u0026rdquo; attached to them and users \u0026ldquo;pay\u0026rdquo; a price in a digital currency based on their status (e.g. free for a student or a researcher without funding, a fair amount for someone having funding, expensive for someone with many prior violations). One colleague said this \u0026ldquo;monetization\u0026rdquo; was against the spirit of data sharing. Probably. But is it?\nMy intention of mentioning digital currencies was simply to recognize value generated by research work. For data sharing, if citations to a shared dataset with DOIs provide an \u0026ldquo;alternate currency\u0026rdquo; worth considering for tenure promotion. What else mechanisms could be created to promote and facilitate data sharing and \u0026mdash; research integrity, in general? I would argue citations might be too narrow, and not enabling enough. My citation count may signal my prior achievements and help me get funded. But how many grant proposals can I possibly write each year? And a citation count does not represent my reputation in research collaboration, data sharing, peer review, conference organization, etc. As academics, what values do we generate from our work? How to give ourselves credit (not until once in a lifetime tenure promotions)? Crazy? Maybe. But academia is outsourcing \u0026mdash; if not losing \u0026mdash; values generated by us to others \u0026ndash; for-profit publishers, data-rich startups, etc. See the fight for Open Access against the \u0026ldquo;paywall\u0026rdquo;, sometimes in dramatic unlawful manners. See our love-hate relationship with the Impact Factor or other algorithms like h-index that influence who get jobs, tenure, and grants. We can stay proud of those nicely formatted PDFs published in high Impact-Factor journals. But what other things can we care more about? If we\u0026rsquo;re not standing with various types of value generated by our work \u0026mdash; during data collect, data analysis, peer review, journal editing, etc. \u0026mdash; it\u0026rsquo;s probably a matter of time another startup or rich company to claim ownership of a piece of our work.\nIf ten years later learning is earning (see the video below), I predict data sharing, and other value generation or value sharing activities in scholarly research, will also be recognized \u0026mdash; not necessarily with money but with something that can more holistically represent the value of our work and can be used/transacted to enable further scholarly activities.\n \nFinally, my heartfelt thanks to our leaders \u0026mdash; esp. Dr. Felice levine from AERA and Drs. Susan Yoon, Jan van Aalst \u0026amp; Bill Sandoval from ISLS \u0026mdash; in engaging me in this exciting and rewarding journey. I look forward to working further on data sharing and in various inter-related areas.\n","date":1501113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501113600,"objectID":"0bb420005b8ee495e5fa78cebd12a1c4","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2017-07-27-data-sharing-workshop-2/","publishdate":"2017-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-07-27-data-sharing-workshop-2/","section":"post","summary":"Story continued, after Part I.\nIn the 2.5 days of the workshop, the group continued to deepen the discussion on Data Sharing to more concrete and practical items.

I am attending as an early career scholar from the International Society of the Learning Sciences \u0026mdash; my academic home.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s only a half-day into the workshop but I\u0026rsquo;m already amazed by so many great thoughts from a full room of journal editors, program officers from funding agencies, and early career peers. Below I\u0026rsquo;m sharing some general (not necessarily representative) themes of ideas discussed so far at the workshop.\nData Sharing: Where Are We? In preparation for the conference, Dr. Felice J. Levine, the workshop convener from AERA, shared out the classic National Academies Report on Sharing Research Data that was released in 1985. I read it on my flight into D.C. and it was a worth read. What stroke me was: many thoughts I compiled in preparation of the workshop were already elaborated in this 32-year-old report. The value of data sharing is not newly recognized. Many challenges have persisted.\nBefore reading this report, I happened to read a much newer article titled Administrative social science data: The challenge of reproducible research published in Big Data \u0026amp; Society \u0026mdash; a journal I reviewed for. There are some clear advancements the social science communities (and scholarly communities in general) have made since 1985. For instance, we have various research tools and platforms available these days to facilitate data management, sharing, and publishing. Git \u0026mdash; a version control system highly recommended by this article \u0026mdash; was nonexistent when the National Academies Report came out; neither were platforms and initiatives such as Open Science Framework, Harvard Dataverse Network, and Figshare. However, when juxtaposing challenges discussed in both pieces, what stroke me \u0026mdash; again \u0026mdash; was how slow it has been to shift academic cultures to promote data sharing. Indeed, developing tools are easier, whereas changing cultures at many levels \u0026mdash; e.g., in research labs, departments and colleges, institutions, associations, funding agencies \u0026mdash; are much much more difficult.\nDiscussion Themes Perspectives from these two pieces were echoed in a round of self-intros at the workshop this afternoon. Below are some keywords I noted, which again, reflect my own bias.\nData. One important point was made about what we mean by data. This is not only about the traditional dichotomy of qualitative vs. quantitative data, but also \u0026mdash; purposes of data, power relations in data and data systems (e.g., whom are served by data), shapes of data, etc. I recently wrote in an invited think piece in Chinese about how the term data (数据) originally meant punishing people in ancient Chinese. In the same vein, one colleague commented on the word research being dirty to Indigenous peoples. These views apply here in educational research data as well and therefore in data sharing.\nContexts of research data are also extremely important. Data shared without sufficient information about their context are useless. This fact places burden on both initial investigators who share data (because they need to explain the context in prep for data sharing) and secondary analysts who need to understand the context (often based on insufficient documentation). More work is probably needed to further unpack data, and to articulate data that are shareable, situations where data are meaningful to be shared, and constituents of shared data.\nCulture and practices. I believe this topic was mostly discussed so far. Subtopics include incentives and disincentives related to data sharing, which are explored in depth in the National Academies Report. For an assistant professor like me, for example, the current tenure process does not credit my investment in data sharing or data publishing. Even if I publish a dataset with a DOI attached to it, it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t carry the same weight as an empirical piece in a top journal. An editor mentioned it\u0026rsquo;s also considered \u0026ldquo;suboptimal\u0026rdquo; for someone\u0026rsquo;s tenure case to publish a study based on secondary data. While there is currently less credit given to data sharing practices, disincentives abound, which are also elaborated in the National Academies Report. Therefore, data sharing does not only need a few mavericks but systematic investments to incentify and sustain culture changes.\nEthics. Another major concern was ethical challenges related to data sharing. It was refreshing to hear from one senior colleague sharing that patients whose data were collected for medical research were eager to have their data shared, because they wished to contribute to the quest for a cure, while laws and ethics guidelines prohibit sharing of personal health data. For me as an early career scholar, I tend to make \u0026ldquo;the minimal ask\u0026rdquo; when preparing my IRB protocols \u0026mdash; only because the IRB work with an IRB office and a school district is already so daunting for someone who\u0026rsquo;s still navigating the systems. I worry that being ambitious in data sharing would undermine the likelihood of getting research protocols approved. In addition to putting a sentence to a journal\u0026rsquo;s homepage saying \u0026ldquo;you should share your data\u0026rdquo;, we need additional resources to help scholars deal with ethical challenges even before a study is conducted.\nInfrastructure. Numerous initiatives have emerged to support data sharing, and open science in general. I look forward to experts who are in the forefront of these matters to share their work. For example, colleagues from the Center for Open Science, which has developed systems like the Open Science Framework and OSF Preprints, will present tomorrow. As an advocate of open science, I am also intrigued by recent work by writing \u0026amp; preprint platforms like Authorea and code sharing platforms like Code Ocean which do not only allow sharing of Research Objects but more interactive forms of scholarly discourse \u0026amp; content consumption (e.g., interactive visualizations linked with shared data and directly embedded in publications). So, technically we are (almost) there.\nValue. At the dinner table, it was refreshing to hear from senior scholars how they had to mail out their manuscripts when submitting to a journal and how they needed to fax their reviews to a journal/conference. At that time, the manuscript was almost the only thing others can see from someone\u0026rsquo;s work. We talked about how we can now assign value to so many \u0026ldquo;middle-products\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;byproducts\u0026rdquo; of academic research in addition to an article as an end-product. This is linked to a point made in my last blog post about the need to expand valuation in education to include artifacts generated in learning processes. After reading emerging, draft guidelines that encourage and, in some cases, enforce citations of shared data, I\u0026rsquo;m increasingly optimistic about new cultures of research and publishing that are yet to come.\nStay tuned.\nResources  Fienberg, S.

When it came the season to plow the fields, they had to hire experts \u0026mdash; a situation that could be tough when the only buffalo became fully booked. And as picky farmers, they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to hire any random, potentially lousy buffalo handlers, who might plow shallowly (to save the buffalo\u0026rsquo;s energy) and jeopardize the harvest of a whole year. Indeed, for my grandparents\u0026rsquo; generation in the village, knowing how to handle a water buffalo was valuable, more valuable than going to schools.\nThings changed for my parents\u0026rsquo; generation. They saw growing value of formal education. My dad became the first one of his generation in the family to enter a \u0026ldquo;teacher\u0026rsquo;s school\u0026rdquo; (equivalent to high school) and to land a teaching job with a monthly paycheck. My mom went to high school but narrowly missed college. What became remarkable in their careers was the value of a diploma, with which my dad went on to work as a teacher, received additional training, and is now leading a small team in a local educational department. My mom, with \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; a high-school diploma, has been teaching for decades but is not recognized as a formal member of the teaching force. The differences a diploma could make came up a million times at our dinner table. So my parents\u0026rsquo; shared dream was to send me to college \u0026mdash; to get an even better diploma from a much bigger place.\nThe pursuit for advanced degrees became exactly what my generation was all about. While my parents could not fully invest in schoolwork because they had to take care of their families, my generation was generally sucked into homework and crazy amounts of standardized tests. I did get a high-school diploma like my mom and ventured 2,000 miles to Beijing for a college degree, which led me to opportunities of doing what I\u0026rsquo;m doing \u0026mdash; a huge privilege for a kid whose dream was as big and as far as going to college.\nFrom handling a water buffalo to holding a respected diploma/degree, what is seen as valuable, or having value, has dramatically shifted across three generations in my family. If formal education is conceptualized as an activity leading to an outcome. For my grandparents, the outcome was not as valuable as being able to handle a water buffalo. For my parents and myself, the outcome was a diploma, certificate or degree, which accreditates knowledge as \u0026ldquo;entities\u0026rdquo; passed onto us through education and entitles us to work on certain jobs or to pursuit new goals.\nNow, what will happen for my son\u0026rsquo;s generation?\nIt could be possible when my son graduates from college, there is no or very few jobs. This is not being pessimist about the economy, but a reality check given the rise of automation and artificial intelligence. As a report published by McKinsey claims, automation and artificial intelligence could readily carry out 45% of paid activities across the U.S. economy, influencing about 60% of all occupations. While routine tasks in manufacturing, transportation and food service is already being automated, jobs requiring creativity and emotions are where humanity will be seeking meaningful work in the foreseeable future [1]. Even if technical feasibility of automation does not guarantee adoption, education \u0026mdash; which has been (partially) charged with workforce preparation \u0026mdash; is facing hard questions. What if an education does not lead to a job, because there is no, or not enough, jobs? Are curriculum standards limiting the scope of education to areas that would be soon automated? How the \u0026ldquo;achievement gap\u0026rdquo; will be re-lived (not relieved) in an era when the meaning of achievement will be fundamentally redefined?\nWe are enduring another \u0026mdash; and maybe even bigger \u0026mdash; shift in valuation in education and learning. For my grandparents, formal education was irrelevant and learning in schools was too detached from their daily lives. What mattered for them was learning knowledge in-use and of practical value, like handling a water buffalo, which was not valued in education. This situation changed for my parents\u0026rsquo; and my generation, as formal accreditations from educational institutions are not only relevant but connected to social mobility more than ever before. Degrees, certificates and transcripts given by respected institutions are trusted accreditation of acquired knowledge and skills valued by curriculum standards. With a teaching certificate, my dad became eligible to teach. With a university degree, many doors opened for me. These credentials carry great amounts of value and trust \u0026mdash; not determined by learners and educational institutions, but the broader changing societal landscape.\nHowever, one issue with this model is these credentials mark the endpoints of educational experiences which are put in a \u0026ldquo;black box\u0026rdquo; for outsiders and are not consistently regarded by the credentialing process in different societies, institutions, departments, or even different iterations of a same course. And yet a same GPA from a same school is equivalently valued, because it is the only thing that gets valued and remains visible after a learning journey is \u0026ldquo;done.\u0026rdquo; Things that get produced in learning towards these credentials are largely disregarded and discarded during credentialing; in most cases, they are not seen as generating value at all.\nIt is only quite recently in new cultures of learning [2], where artifacts generated in learning are more recognized. Exciting projects are emerging, e.g., Open Badges and the newer Transcripts on blockchain, which open up new ways to credit learning. Specifically, we can now credit a broader range of learner achievements, democratize the practice of credentialing, and give learners stronger control over their credentials. However, in many cases a new technology is adopted to embrace an old educational model \u0026mdash; or more precisely an old valuation model that disregards learning in-situ or knowledge that exists in flows of participation, collaboration, and authentic problem-solving. If automation and artificial intelligence are taking away jobs, and if future generations can only find meaningful work at the \u0026ldquo;creative end,\u0026rdquo; some larger questions regarding value and valuation need to be discussed. In the newer context of broad and deep automation, and after decades of discussing 21st century competencies:\n What should be seen as having value in learning processes? Who are entitled to the act of valuation, if not (only) traditional institutions? After valuation, how would value be presented? And to whom? Will future learners get paid to learn? Or for what they produce \u0026mdash; such as artifacts, meaningful social connections, something contributing to public goods \u0026mdash; in learning processes? What are the roles of a curriculum? How equatable opportunities could be ensured given existing gaps and new divides introduced by any new valuation model?  I am curious about your responses to these bizarre or maybe unanswerable questions.\nNotes\n [1] Sources from McKinsey Quarterly: Where machines could replace humans—and where they can’t (yet), and Four fundamentals of workplace automation.

The whole world \u0026ndash; or all Reddit users \u0026ndash; were given a 999 x 999 blank canvas to draw on. Some simple rules apply:\n Each user could choose one pixel from 16 colors to place anywhere on the canvas. They could place as many pixels of as many colors as they wanted, but they had to wait a few minutes between placing each one. (source)\n During the following 72 hours, amazingly interesting things happened on this 999 x 999 canvas. Below is a gif that gives you a glimpse into what had happened. Numerous accounts of this event have been posted. See this post for a good overview, and more posts can be found at the Reddit Place itself.\nGraphing the Reddit Place with Neo4j The Reddit Place as a web-based social phenomenon will be remembered and studied by many people. I didn\u0026rsquo;t follow this event at all but was amazed by the various types of participating users, sub-communities who self-organized to achieve certain goals, clashes and fights, evolving rules, impressive artworks, and so on \u0026ndash; all that happened on this little canvas. I\u0026rsquo;m especially intrigued by the emergent, self-organizing processes of constructing, destructing, negotiating, and re-constructing among numerous users and user networks supported by all kinds of communication tools (mostly Reddit itself).\nWith a data dump that captured the history of this event, I could not resist myself from playing with it using Neo4j.\nImporting data To begin with, I wrote the following Cypher scripts to import the csv dump into Neo4j:\n{% highlight cypher %} // Set constraints CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Point) ASSERT p.location IS UNIQUE; CREATE INDEX ON :User(name);\n// Insert data USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000 LOAD CSV FROM \u0026ldquo;file:///export.csv\u0026rdquo; AS l WITH l, [toInt(l[1]), toInt(l[2])] AS loc WHERE l[3] IS NOT NULL MERGE (p:Point {location: loc}) ON CREATE SET p.location = loc, p.count = 1 ON MATCH SET p.count = p.count + 1 MERGE (u:User {name: l[3]}) ON CREATE SET u.name = l[3], u.count = 1 ON MATCH SET u.count = u.count + 1 MERGE (u)-[r:PAINT]-\u0026gt;(p) ON CREATE SET r.count = 1, r.ids = [toInt(l[0])], r.colors = [toInt(l[4])], r.times = [toInt(l[5])] ON MATCH SET r.count = r.count + 1, r.ids = r.ids + toInt(l[0]), r.colors = r.colors + toInt(l[4]), r.times = r.times + toInt(l[5]); {% endhighlight %}\nThe figure below demonstrates the graph model of the created Neo4j graph database. The model is quite simple and intuitive, including two node types named User and Point and one relationship type named Paint.\nIt took my computer ~22 minutes to create 1.6 million labels, 1.6 million nodes, 28.8 million properties, and 4.13 million relationships in this graph database, the size of which ended up to be 4.30 GB.\nGeneral queries After data were loaded, I did some quick queries.\nFirst, who were the most active users? User itsnotlupus won the game as s/he painted for 177 times. This may not sound much but if you multiple 177 by 5 minutes (the \u0026lsquo;cooldown\u0026rsquo; time), you will find the user spent roughly 15 hours painting or contemplating the next pixel on the canvas. This time amount does not include activities in other communication tools.\nWhere did itsnotlupus paint? Below is a graph showing this user (in the center) and 100 pixels s/he painted on. Note that each pixel is identified by its coordinates in the 2D canvas.\nI noticed this user painted a whole lot near Point [380, 880]. By clicking on the [380, 881] Point node, see below, I could check who else have painted on that spot. 16 other users have painted there. Maybe there were some interesting collisions on that single pixel?\nWhich colors did itsnotlupus use? It appeared itsnotlupus painted #E59500 for 104 times, and #E50000 for 70 times. Do those two colors belong to specific clans itsnotlupus was affiliated with?\n{% highlight cypher %} MATCH (u:User {name: \u0026ldquo;itsnotlupus\u0026rdquo;})-[r:PAINT]-\u0026gt;() WITH collect(r.colors) as colors UNWIND colors as array UNWIND array as color RETURN color, count(color) as count ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10 {% endhighlight %}\nThe Blue Corner Based on this post, the lower-right corner was occupied by Blue. So I checked the corner pixel [999, 999]. The following Cypher query returned a total of 10,121 user actions on that single pixel. The figure that follows shows 100 of those users who painted at [999, 999].\n{% highlight cypher %} MATCH (p:Point {location: [999, 999]})\u0026lt;-[r:PAINT]-() RETURN count\u0026reg; {% endhighlight %}\nTop painters in that corner are listed in the figure below. Querying the top [999, 999] painter MrMeltJr I found him painting blue (#0000EA) predominantly (105 out of 116 times). He was clearly a member of the Blue Corner sub-community.\nWhat was the most used color in that corner? The following query found the most dominant color to be #0000EA, which appeared for 7400 times, followed by #820080\u0026rsquo;s 2055 times. This finding could be confirmed by the gif above.\n{% highlight cypher %} MATCH (p:Point {location: [999, 999]})\u0026lt;-[r:PAINT]-() WITH collect(r.colors) as allColors UNWIND allColors as array UNWIND array as color RETURN color, count(color) as count ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10 {% endhighlight %}\nMore Fun to Come These queries are far from even scratching the surface of the complex social phenomenon. Two aspects I\u0026rsquo;m especially interested in exploring (if I have time) are the temporal aspect of user actions on single pixels and the spacial aspect of changes with neighboring pixels. In addition, it would also be useful if we could connect communication and coordination among users and communities external to the canvas.\nYes, now I see the April Fool\u0026rsquo;s Day could be fun!\n","date":1491782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491782400,"objectID":"229246857bba35a20921b7862a7dca88","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2017-04-10-graphing-reddit-place/","publishdate":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-04-10-graphing-reddit-place/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ver never liked the April Fool\u0026rsquo;s Day, until this year when Reddit decided to launch a social experiment called Reddit Place.\nThe idea is simple.
