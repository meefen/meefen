First, it\u0026rsquo;s held near the end of November, for the first time in summer for folks from the Southern Hemisphere. Second, the conference is going to be virtual, following a hybrid synchronous\u0026ndash;asynchronous model. Much work will be done in Knowledge Forum asynchronously before interactive sessions in Zoom on the conference days. Last but not least, this year\u0026rsquo;s conference will feature a global KB design experiment, Saving the Planet, Saving Lives, led by colleagues from Ontario and Singpapore. See conference program here for details.\nFor me, it\u0026rsquo;s especially exciting to see a broadening interest in Knowledge Building (KB) Analytics in this intimate community. I still believe KB has a special place in learning analytics because its views on learning and education (see Chen \u0026amp; Zhang, 2016). KB\u0026rsquo;s attempt to refashion education into an effort aligned with knowledge societies can also help learning analytics find more common grounds with CSCW, HCI, knowledge analytics, etc.\nThis year, there are one theme and two sessions dedicated to Knowledge Building Analytics at KBSI. Here are my quick takeaways, before the conference, from reading papers in these sessions.\nGraph/network based approaches A number of contributions have adopted a graph/network approach.\n Xue, Zhang, \u0026amp; Xu (Nanjing Normal Unversity) propose to construct dynamic knowledge graphs (DKG) to assess and foster conceptual change. The DKG approach integrates a wide range of techniques from natural language processing (POS tagging, topic modeling, Word2vec), association rule mining, and graph visualization. With the constructed graph, centrality indices can be used to surface key concepts, which collectively provide indicators of a community\u0026rsquo;s current conceptual understanding. The DKG approach is an important technical advancement for KB analytics. It builds on a long-term interest in using network/graph approaches (e.g., KBDeX) in the KB community. It expands our KB analytics work by combining nascent graph database technologies, data mining techniques, and front-end web interfaces to deliver a complete analytics package. Grounded in the \u0026ldquo;Good moves in knowledge-creating dialogue\u0026rdquo; framework by Bereiter and Scardamalia (2016), Feng, van Aalst, \u0026amp; Chan (University of Hong Kong) propose to use the Idea-Friend Maps to help students consider new ideas, meta-dialogue, high-level ideas, etc. The Idea-Friend Maps use the word networks extracted from KBDeX and enrich them with important information such as knowledge problems. A major contribution made by the Idea-Friend Maps project is it meaningfully connects sophisticated conceptual ideas (i.e. the Good Moves framework) and analytic tools (i.e., KBDeX) to student engagement. The Maps and their accompanying questions are actionable for students. Hussein \u0026amp; Chen (Univeresity of Minnesota) propose to use network-based text analysis to bridge gaps in knowledge-building discourse, by using network indices and network phenomena such as structural holes. This work is situated in the goal of connecting discourse across spaces but is applicable to meta-discourse.  A cross-cutting theme among three contributions (Hussein \u0026amp; Chen; Feng, van Aalst, \u0026amp; Chan; Xue, Zhang, \u0026amp; Xu) is the use of network/graph approaches in KB Analytics. Feng et al. use socio-semantic networks created by KBDeX; Hussein \u0026amp; Chen use text networks that rely on network analysis techniques for topic modeling and structural analysis; Xue et al. integrate a range of data science methods in a graph analysis scheme that leads to the identification of dominant terms. We collectively have an interesting mix of ideas about how to use graphs/networks in KB analytics. Graph/network analysis is a promising direction for our community.\nStudent-facing analytics Besides Feng, van Aalst, \u0026amp; Chan\u0026rsquo;s Idea-Friend Maps described above, Ma, Akyea, \u0026amp; Martin (University of Toronto) have done some really interesting work engaging 8- to 11-year-olds to review and critique current analytic tools in Knowledge Forum. \u0026ldquo;[Students] demonstrated sophisticated interpretations of their online activities with the Knowledge Forum analytic tools. Not only were they honest and open about receiving feedback through novel forms of data visualization, they were also aware of the potential limitations of these tools and offered thoughtful and insightful feedback for our engineers.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Xue et al.\u0026lsquo;s paper, they also mention that pilot studies of the DKG with teachers and students are also underway.\nWe do not necessarily need more advanced analytical techniques. Work that scaffolds student sense-making and use of analytic information is equally (or even more) important. Trying to put more analytic tools \u0026ndash; good ones \u0026ndash; in the hands of students is a promising idea that\u0026rsquo;s aligned with Knowledge Building.\nBridge technical work on analytics and KB concepts/principles Tan \u0026amp; Teo (National Institute of Education, Singapore) take a much-needed meta perspective. Based on a literature review of KB analytics, they propose two sets of guiding questions that are instrumental for future KB analytics design and development. These questions achieve two important goals: (1) to ground analytics design and use in KB ideals (e.g., students take high-level responsibility), and (2) to suggest areas to consider as we put KB analytics tools into practice. These questions are applicable to the other contributions mentioned above. Tan and Teo remind us that we should not forget what these KB analytics are developed for. They also distinguish augmented intelligence from artificial intelligence (AI) and argue the KB community may want to side with the augmented intelligence camp, which is also called intelligence augmentation (IA) by scholars (Engelbart, 1962).\nIt is a promising direction for the community to consolidate a set of such guiding questions for KB analytics and continue to refine them to bring technical work and KB concepts into alignment.\nThoughts on future work Analyze KB discourse as a multidimensional phenomenon. It is apparent that we as a community has quite impressive expertise in applying data science methods to KB discourse data (there is exciting work not covered here such as Dr. Gaoxia Zhu\u0026rsquo;s dissertation work on emotional dynamics). We now need to push for integrated views of KB discourse by bringing various analytical perspectives together \u0026ndash; social, semantic, temporal, emotional, spatial, etc.\nInvolve students and teachers to co-design analytics tools. Multiple papers in these sessions have highlighted the need to look at human factors as we design and deploy KB analytics. This recognition is aligned with human-centered design sought by the learning analytics community in recent years. Feng et al. show us important work that needs to take place to move from analytical results to actionable insights. What\u0026rsquo;s useful is not determined by the researchers or analytical methods; instead, it\u0026rsquo;s determined by the students and teachers who sense-make and problem-solve with the provided information.\nArticulate conceptual groundings of measures and analytical decisions. As mentioned above, the graph/network approach is a promising direction. However, we still need to do a better job at grounding network measures/indices in KB concepts or phenomena. What does betweenness centrality in the word network really mean? Why only nouns are retained in a knowledge graph? Why a certain threshold is chosen when trimming a network? We need to be mindful of these questions and analytical decisions in future work. As a community, we should consider mapping out measures we have, connect them with KB constructs, and examine conceptual congruence and incongruence. Actually, we may need to do a network analysis of our own KB analytics work to identify gaps and future directions.\n That\u0026rsquo;s all for now. I will provide an updated view after the conference.\n","date":1605457719,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605457719,"objectID":"d67c859a7c937e323d32430a4b9e4dc6","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2020-11-15-kb-analytics/","publishdate":"2020-11-15T10:28:39-06:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-11-15-kb-analytics/","section":"post","summary":"This year\u0026rsquo;s Knowledge Building Summer Institute (KBSI) is going to be special.

As a community, learning analytics has grown substantially and to a great extent matured since it emerged around 10 years ago. Thanks to tremendous work by colleagues, we have an annual conference, a professional society, an established journal, and probably even more importantly, significant interest in our field from society. For our community to keep growing and evolving, it is time to come up with a set of self-regulating norms around rigor, not only to achieve broader impacts but also to ensure the impacts contribute to the betterment of learning and education.\nSo, what do we mean by rigor in learning analytics? Full disclosure: I approach this question as someone who was primarily trained in educational technology and learning sciences, and who relies on design-based research, mixed methods, and design partnerships to come up with solutions that get piloted and evaluated in classroom settings.\nAnswering the question of \u0026ldquo;what rigor is\u0026rdquo; is quite hard in learning analytics. A primary reason is that learning analytics is a multidisciplinary area of research and practice. We have an eclectic mix of researchers and practitioners from various disciplinary backgrounds, which often have different sets of standards for judging rigor.\nAs I think about this question, I continued to return to the fundamental premise that motivated the formation of our field. That is: if we do a good job at measuring, collecting, analyzing, and reporting learning data, we could better understand and eventually improve conditions for learning (see SoLAR\u0026rsquo;s definition of learning analytics). This is a laudable and ambitious endeavor that is truly complex. To break this work down, we can recognize different types of work going on in our research community. On one hand, there is exciting work that tries to apply computational techniques or data science methods, to investigating learning and teaching using all sorts of data. On the other hand, many of us are designing tools and interventions for learners and educators to act on certain information, in many cases outputs of computational analysis. As we discuss rigor in learning analytics, we need to recognize that these two distinct \u0026ldquo;buckets of work\u0026rdquo; are quite different and need to be judged based on quite different criteria.\nToday, I would like to turn more attention to the second bucket of work that is about designing tools and interventions to improve conditions for learning. Within this scope, in addition to these important notions of conceptual rigor, methodological rigor, measurement rigor, and reporting rigors, ideas that you find in methodology textbooks, I want to argue that we need to highlight relevance to practice and the extent to which practice is engaged as additional criteria of rigor. Following this idea, there are at least two facets of rigor to consider:\nFirst, we need to disclose the educational ideals and value premises that motivate a particular study or intervention, and the ways in which educational practice contributes to the formation of a solution. The work of putting learning analytics tools into practice is fundamentally interventionist. The rigor with our design solutions is not only about their data sources or computational techniques, but how education as a (complex) system is considered, how key stakeholders such as learners and teachers are involved, how different perspectives (and their tensions) are considered, etc. Are the value premises hold by the researchers, designers or technologies in line with these key stakeholders, especially if they are impacted by the introduced intervention. Answering these questions may be even more important than demonstrating conceptual and methodological rigor. As we instrument learning analytics solutions in practical contexts, we need a bi-directional dialogue to improve rigor of our solutions in a sense that they are relevant to practice and in line with educational wisdom. Human-centered design approaches, which involve both quantitative and qualitative methods, are important for this work.\nSecond, as we move into evaluating an intervention, rigor requires sustained, direct, and systematic documentation of what takes place in authentic learning contexts. Learning and teaching are messy. The transition of research knowledge (embedded in tools) into professional practice is also highly complex. We should not rush to conduct RCT trials in the early phase of a new learning analytics intervention. Instead, we need to gain a nuanced view of how students and teachers might react to the intervention in practice, and how the local context might dynamically react to the intervention. Students and teachers operate within existing systems. Intended outcomes in a classroom are mediated by factors that operate at school and district levels. In this case, qualitative work is more than relevant, but crucial for documenting how an intervention works in an authentic setting to illuminate various ways an intervention could go awry.\nTo conclude, as the field of learning analytics continue to evolve, we need to recognize the diverse body work happening in our community and have continuing conversations about what rigor is \u0026ndash; for different types of work. There might be a shared set of principles that cut across different studies/projects. This could be especially helpful for guiding our communication at conferences or in journals. In the meantime, we may need to stay content with disagreements and healthy debates simply because different work needs to answer to different criteria of rigor. Finally, as learning analytics make more real-world impacts \u0026ndash; in some cases at scale \u0026ndash; finding ways to engage practice as we consider rigor is important for realizing the field\u0026rsquo;s potential.\n","date":1605131018,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605131018,"objectID":"ab11f2725d3ee1a2f59eb33e04619dc0","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2020-11-11-rigor-learning-analytics/","publishdate":"2020-11-11T15:43:38-06:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-11-11-rigor-learning-analytics/","section":"post","summary":"First of all, I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank our JLA editors-in-chief and SoLAR for organizing this webinar, and more events to come on the topic of rigor.

It was an interesting challenge given the short timeframe. But we eventually pulled this off as a team thanks to Xinran Zhu\u0026lsquo;s strong leadership and everyone\u0026rsquo;s dedication to this work.\nIn this blog post, I won\u0026rsquo;t talk about what we wrote. (You can read the preprint if you are interested.) Instead, I will talk about how we used social annotation to conduct this collaborative literature review about social annotation. My hope is to share our collaborative research practice based on social annotation to those who\u0026rsquo;re interested.\nWhat is web annotation? My interest in web annotation technologies dates back to my early PhD coursework. In 2010 (exactly 10 years ago), I took a course titled Knowledge Media and Learning offered by Prof Jim Slotta. My colleague Cresencia Fong and I became interested in \u0026ldquo;layered information systems\u0026rdquo; (probably coined by us) and led the class to explore this genre of knowledge media and a tool named Diigo. This work eventually informed my dissertation research on the Promising Ideas tool and promisingness judgments in knowledge-building communities.\nWhat is web annotation exactly?\nIn 2017, the W3C Web Annotation Working Group published the W3C Web Annotation Data Model. As a technical recommendation, this document thinks about annotation very broadly:\n Annotating, the act of creating associations between distinct pieces of information, is a pervasive activity online in many guises. Web citizens make comments about online resources using either tools built in to the hosting website, external web services, or the functionality of an annotation client. Comments about shared photos or videos, reviews of products, or even social network mentions of web resources could all be considered as annotations. In addition, there are a plethora of \u0026ldquo;sticky note\u0026rdquo; systems and stand-alone multimedia annotation systems.\n This document further offers several basic principles to help us think about web annotation. It writes:\n An annotation is a rooted, directed graph that represents a relationship between resources (see the figure below).\nThere are two primary types of resource that participate in this relationship, Bodies and Targets.\n I like this basic technical definition because it articulates the boundary of a web annotation while focusing on the relationships and associations between web objects an annotation involves.\nTo me, the crucial, definitive characteristic of web annotation is an active, retrievable link between the annotation body and the annotated target. Web annotation is fundamentally about the user generating one piece of information and linking it with a pre-existing piece of information on the web.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t this what we do all the time as academic researchers? In the following figure created by the Open Science Framework (OSF) to depict the entire research lifecycle, it appears each stage is about processing existing information and transform it into new information (e.g., from literature to a research idea, from interview data to codes). One main challenge with the research lifecycle, however, is we do not have a good approach to maintain these links between different types of information.\nUsing web annotation for collaborative literature review When conducting this literature review, we used web annotation as an important strategy to maintain the linkages between our analysis/interpretation and the literature we analyzed. Five of us collaborated on this project. So we also used web annotation to link us as collaborators.\nThe collaborative work roughly involved two stages: initial coding, and theme development. We used a web annotation tool named Hypothesis in both stages. Below, I describe how Hypothesis was integrated in our collaborative research workflow.\nInitial coding stage After a systematic literature search and screening, we narrowed our scope down to ~40 research articles. It\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable size for a typical literature review and we had a lot to process within a short timeframe.\nAfter deciding to use Hypothesis, we created a private group for this work.\nAfter a few Zoom meetings, we came up with a few key dimensions that would be used to consistently code all articles. In particular, we agreed that for each article, we would code its content related to \u0026ldquo;level of education,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;subject area,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;technology,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;activity design,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;research methods,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;learning outcomes\u0026rdquo; using their corresponding tags. For each article, the lead researcher would also create a page note to summarize key take-aways from this article.\nIn total, we generated 494 annotations about ~40 articles. Below is a screenshot of our group page.\nImportantly, our Hypothesis annotations were created within the context of each article, and the relationships between our codes and the original content were preserved. For each article, the annotations are both summarized on the group page and remain embedded in the annotated document.\nTheme development stage After the initial coding, the next challenge for the team was to distill a couple themes to synthesize our findings and make them useful for the reader.\nTo this end, each of us first reviewed all annotations made by the group and replied to each other when there was a question or suggestion about a particular annotation.\nWe used the native Hypothesis interface to filter our annotations by tags. For example, clicking on tag #design would help us quickly retrieve information about every study\u0026rsquo;s activity design.\nWe also used a tool named Facet that was developed by Jon Udell. With Facet, we could not only review and filter our annotations, but also download them into different formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).\nAfter several Zoom meetings and writing sprints, we synthesized our findings into five themes that are reported in the manuscript (see the table below). During the write-up, I went back to read specific annotations, drawing on our annotations as a database of ideas.\nHow is web annotation useful for a literature review project like this? There are designers like Andy Matuschak who are thinking deeply about tools for thought and for knowledge work. A pity we academics do not spend enough time to think about our knowledge work. Rumors are that some of us are still using a giant Word document to keep references.\nTo me, tools I use as a researcher are my extended brain and carry out important cognitive work for/with me. It would also be ideal if tools I use also embody my philosophies.\nWith these high-level ideas in mind, web annotation is useful for me in a number of ways.\nFirst, from both the UI and the technical implementation, web annotation cares about relationships and links and tries to keep them alive. In this case, it kept my reaction to a piece of information in an article anchored in the exact place where my reaction occurred. I can choose to go back to the location where an annotation was created (assuming the file is not corrupted).\nSecond, web annotation enhances within-group accountability. Within the team, we made our thinking visible to each other by explicitly anchoring our ideas in the analyzed articles. Without the step of socially annotating these articles, we would probably directly write notes in a Google doc, with the links between our ideas and the analyzed literature largely obscure and inconsistently maintained. Being able to see and respond to each other\u0026rsquo;s initial annotations had two effects: 1) it made the annotator more accountable when annotating, as these annotations were not only for herself but for the team; and 2) we did challenge each other\u0026rsquo;s annotations, which lead to greater inter-rater reliability.\nThird, web annotation enhanced research transparency and reproducibility. The fact we can go back to check our initial coding at any point makes our (qualitative) work much more reproducible. We could even include our annotations in the submission if a journal demands it.\nFinally, using web annotation is fun. I appreciated so much of everyone\u0026rsquo;s thinking. It made literature reading more social and less like a solo sport. Here, I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank all team members, Xinran Zhu, Rukmini Manasa, Hong Shui, and Raymond Zhang, who shared this journey with me.\n","date":1589249581,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589249581,"objectID":"27718aaf6e6a3a625254ece3095b0b23","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2020-05-11-web-annotation/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T21:13:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-05-11-web-annotation/","section":"post","summary":"In response to a special call for papers from Information and Learning Sciences, a team of us rallied and wrote a review article about Using Social Annotation in Online Classes (see preprint).

Below is a draft abstract of the chapter. In this post, I am sharing a key message from this chapter \u0026ndash; a map of collaboration analytics \u0026ndash; and invite you to provide me feedback and suggestions.\n Abstract: Collaboration is an important competency in the modern society. To harness the intersection of learning, work, collaboration, and analytics, several fundamental challenges need to be addressed. This chapter about collaboration analytics aims to mitigate these challenges for the learning analytics community. We first survey the conceptual landscape of collaboration and learning with a focus on the CSCL literature while attending to perspectives from CSCW and HCI. Grounded in the conceptual exploration, we then distinguish two salient strands of collaboration analytics: (a) computational analysis of collaboration that involves the application of computational methods to examining collaborative processes; and (b) analytics for collaboration which is primarily concerned with designing and deploying data analytics in authentic contexts to facilitate collaboration. Examples and cases representing contexts of different scale, space, and analytical frames are presented, followed by a discussion of key challenges and future directions.\n The matrices of groupware systems In CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work), researchers have developed a number of ways to classify groupware systems that support cooperative/collaborative1 work.\nOne representative example is classifying groupware by where and when the participants are performing the cooperative work (see the figure below from Grudin, 1994). A time/space matrix is used to summarize the classification. The time/space matrix is a very useful reference when discussing a particular cooperative work context and design constraints it entails.\nA map of collaboration analytics When thinking about analytics for collaboration \u0026ndash; collaborative learning or work \u0026ndash; we think the community could benefit from such a classification system. Here, we locate the central concern of analytics at the translation/transformation of findings from analysis to actions in the learning analytics cycle. While the analysis of collaboration is dictated by epistemological and conceptual ideas (which are expanded in the chapter but not this post), the use of analytics for collaboration deals with the distribution of agency between human and computer, as well as a wide range of other design decisions. So the map of collaboration analytics we derive is based on how collaboration analytics are deployed in socio-technical systems of collaboration to make an impact.\nAs illustrated in the table below, we discuss collaboration analytics along two important dimensions: (1) analytics as partner vs. regulartor, and (2) analytic actions being closely vs. loosely coupled with collaboration. While there are other dimensions to consider, such as by the consumer of analytic information and the level of analytic focus, we choose to articulate these two dimensions as they are central to human-computer partnership that CSCL and CSCW care about since their inceptions.\nDimension 1: Analytics as Partner vs. Regulator of Collaboration The first dimension is concerned with the power distribution between analytics and humans (e.g., learners, teachers). Along this dimension, we distinguish analytics as a regulator versus a partner of collaborative interaction.\nWhen analytics functions as a partner of collaboration, it acts to facilitate collaboration but still turns to humans for action-taking. For instance, analytics applications are designed to support time coordination, a surprisingly challenging task for today’s organizations, teams, and families. Time coordination is a hard problem not only because of the geographical and temporal distribution of team members, but also explicit and implicit temporal structures not commonly understood by team members (Wu et al., 2016). Coordinating schedules among co-workers could still be a frustrating task despite coordination systems such as shared calendars. To confront this challenge, HCI and CSCW researchers have created A.I. scheduling assistants that act just like human agents to schedule meetings (Cranshaw et al., 2017; Modi et al., 2005). Based on a combination of heuristics, machine learning, and natural language processing, such A.I. assistants are trained to extract meeting information, such as meeting subject, time, and attendees, from emails and engage in back-and-forth messages to coordinate meetings (Cranshaw et al., 2017). In this case, the A.I. agent serves as a partner delegated to solve the mundane and yet non-trivial task of time coordination.\nAnalytics can be a partner for team formation in large-scale collaboration settings. NovoEd is a social learning environment that supports team formation processes in massive online classes. Teams can be formed algorithmically based on instructor-specified factors such as size of the team and geographical location of the members, while learners can also self-organize themselves into “organic” teams (Ronaghi Khameneh et al., 2017). Another analytics-based team formation approach draws on discussion data and algorithmically assigns learners to teams based on their transactive interaction with each other (Wen et al., 2017). On Wikipedia, a variety of algorithms are designed to recommend newcomers into WikiProjects based on their interests in or relationships with project topics; human agents including project leaders remain “in the loop” to carry out the action of inviting newcomers (Zhu et al., 2018).\nBesides temporal coordination and team formation, analytics can also be a partner that provides content-specific support relevant to the task. For instance, Winkler et al. (2019) developed a smart personal assistant using Alexa to facilitate collaborative problem-solving by providing proactive structured facilitation and reactive help for humans’ content-specific questions. When analytics act as a partner in such cases, they provide important affordances that contribute to key constructs of collaboration, but do not evaluate collaboration or prescribe actions on the human’s behalf.\nWhen analytics acts as a regulator, in contrast, it takes responsibility in monitoring the status of collaboration and taking actions to shape the ongoing progress of collaboration. One straightforward example is the awareness lantern designed by Alavi \u0026amp; Dillenbourg (2012). Combining colors, lightness, and blinking, the lantern creates an ambient display of the status of collaborative groups designed to attract the tutor’s attention. Student teams can press the lantern to call for help and the lantern blinks and adjusts the blinking frequency based on the wait time. In this case, the lantern directly mirrors the status of collaborative groups and regulates the help-seeking process in a classroom. In a different example, sociometric badges are used to collect and analyze data from geographically distributed teams and provide instant feedback about team participation (Kim et al., 2012). Based on speech and group interaction patterns captured by sociometric badges, feedback is provided about the participation balance within a group to promote active and balanced participation and frequent turn transitions (Kim et al., 2012). In classrooms where multiple collaborative teams are in action, teacher dashboards are designed to capture multiple group indicators (e.g., task progress, participation balance) and alert the teacher when a group deviates from a norm (van Leeuwen et al., 2019). In these cases, analytics provide evaluative information about collaboration to different analytics “consumers” (the teacher, participants, software) for them to take regulatory actions towards collaboration.\nDimension 2: Action-taking Being Closely vs. Loosely Coupled with Collaboration The second dimension is about the ways in which the analytics are integrated with collaboration processes. Here we distinguish analytics that are closely vs. loosely coupled with collaborative actions. This distinction is concerned with the relation between analytics-based action-taking and the other components of a collaboration workflow.\nOn one side of the continuum, analytic outputs present merely outcomes of computational analysis of collaboration and it is up to humans to choose whether, when, and how to act upon the presented information. On Wikipedia, quality management in the editorial process is increasingly relying on algorithmic agents or “bots” (Geiger, 2009). For instance, the SuggestBot applies a combination of text analysis, collaborative filtering, and hyperlink following to suggest editing tasks to Wikipedia editors based on their edit histories; suggestions are made directly to an editor who would decide how to react (Cosley et al., 2007). In this case, analytics is loosely coupled with any individual or collaborative editing efforts. In contrast, the ClueBot NG is designed to automatically detect vandalism based on a machine learning approach and autonomously revert vandalism as soon as it is discovered (Zheng et al., 2019). While both bots act as partners (see Dimension 1), they differ in how closely their analytic actions are coupled with the overall editing process on Wikipedia.\nIn knowledge building classrooms, teachers and students have had access to dashboard-like analytics tools embedded in the Knowledge Forum since the ‘90s (Burtis, 1998; Teplovs et al., 2007). Much like teacher dashboards in CSCL classrooms (van Leeuwen et al., 2019), these analytics, such as social network and lexical analysis tools, are loosely coupled with the knowledge-building workflow. A more recently developed “meta-discourse” tool known as the Idea Thread Mapper shares the same characteristic (Zhang et al., 2018). This tool’s goal is to engage learners in reflecting on their collective knowledge progress as a community by creating, visualizing, and inspecting “idea threads” in their Knowledge Forum dialogues. These idea threads \u0026ndash; created by students with assistance from topic modeling techniques \u0026ndash; demonstrate salient themes and knowledge structures in their inquiry (Zhang et al., 2018). Similar to the Wikipedia SuggestBot, the Idea Thread Mapper is also loosely coupled with students’ knowledge work and it is up to the humans to trigger its use during knowledge building.\nOn the other side of the continuum, analytic actions are deeply embedded in collaboration processes. Analytic tools embody ideas about how actions should be taken in response to a collaborative situation. In the context of scripted collaborative inquiry, software agents can be specially designed to process student interactions in real-time in response to both pre-specified scripts and emergent collaborative scenarios. For example, in a “smart learning space” designed to facilitate sophisticated collaborative inquiry, high-school students work together as a community to address science problems (Tissenbaum \u0026amp; Slotta, 2019). Tablets, large displays, multi-touch tables, and the teacher play distinct roles in supporting the inquiry. In particular, multiple real-time software agents are present, including a Student Sorting Agent that sorts students into groups, a Consensus Agent that monitors whether groups have achieved consensus, and a Student Progress Agent that tracks individual, small group, and whole class progress. Drawing from various computational techniques, these software agents automate important parts of the collaboration scripts and help the teacher make orchestrational decisions (Tissenbaum \u0026amp; Slotta, 2019). The roles played by these software agents are akin to the operators in an orchestration graph (Dillenbourg, 2015). In a concrete example of using orchestration graphs to facilitate sophisticated collaboration workflow in an online classroom, a variety of operators are created to respond to artifacts generated by individuals, groups, and the class in real time (Chen et al., 2020; Håklev et al., 2017). Analytic actions (such as distributing student-generated post-it notes based on groups and topics) are embodied by these operators, setting the condition for the next collaboration activity (such as making sense of the assigned post-it notes as a group). Here, analytics are tightly coupled with predefined collaboration scenarios or workflows.\nConversational agents developed to facilitate peer collaboration can also embody analytic supports tightly within the flow of collaborative conversations. For example, MentorChat asks learners to collaborate on open-ended learning tasks through online chats. Drawing on the Accountable Talk framework that details productive classroom discussion practices and norms (Michaels et al., 2008), MentorChat processes each dialogue contribution, updates students’ domain models, decides whether an intervention is desirable, and if so, delivers its intervention verbally using a text-to-speech engine (Tegos \u0026amp; Demetriadis, 2017). Analytics, including semantic analysis based on WordNet, directly responds to the unfolding student dialogue; the agent directly intervenes and hereby triggers further student conversations (Tegos \u0026amp; Demetriadis, 2017). In contrast with the Alexa-based conversational agent that acts as a partner who answers student questions (Winkler et al., 2019), MentorChat serves a regulatory role by monitoring students’ domain understanding and directly intervening when necessary.\nConcluding Remarks To summarize, we identified two important dimensions of collaboration analytics: analytics as regulator vs. partner, and analytic actions being tightly vs. loosely coupled with collaborative interaction. This typology can provide a roadmap for future development of collaboration analytics. It is important to note that these two dimensions are two continuums and, as illustrated in these aforementioned cases, one analytics application could serve multiple roles that cut across multiple areas of the space.\nThe presented map of collaboration analytics gives special attention to the distribution of agency between humans and analytics in socio-technical systems of collaboration. On Wikipedia, the delicate relations between human editors and bots, as well as among bots, are especially illuminating (Geiger, 2009; Tsvetkova et al., 2017). The learning analytics community needs robust design approaches to help us cope with value tensions and ethical dilemmas in a learning analytics system. As human activities are shaped by various analytics tools, we need to critically examine the structures (temporal, spatial, social, material, conceptual) created for collaboration and the ways in which human and computer agents are collectively shaping these structures.\n  Collaboration and cooperation are used interchangeably in general discourse and in fields such as CSCW and HCI; for them collaboration broadly means teamwork and cooperative work in a group. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1588259126,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588259126,"objectID":"b4fa5d2e4e837c4fe3212d88907d60a2","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2020-04-30-collaboration-analytics/","publishdate":"2020-04-30T10:05:26-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-04-30-collaboration-analytics/","section":"post","summary":"In a chapter to be included in the 2nd edition of the Handbook of Learning Analytis, Dr. Stephanie Teasley and I tried to write about Collaboration Analytics in a way that integrate ideas from CSCL, CSCW, learning sciences, and learning analytics.

Networks provide a powerful way to think about a variety of phenomena from economic and political interdependencies among countries, interactions between humans in local communities, and to protein interactions in drug development. In education, networks give ways to describe human relationships, neural activities in brains, technology-mediated interactions, language development, discourse patterns, etc. The common use of networks to depict these phenomena is unsurprising given the variety of educational theories and approaches that are deeply committed to a networked view of learning. Compatible with this view, network analysis is applied as a method for understanding learning and connections involved in learning.\nThis webinar will explore the conceptual, methodological, and practical use of networks in learning analytics by presenting examples from real-world learning and teaching scenarios that cover the following areas.

In this paper, we argue that the analysis of online peer interactions would benefit from the focus on relational events that are temporal and occur due to a range of factors. To demonstrate the possibility, we applied Relational Event Modeling (REM) to a dataset from online discussions in seven online classes. Informed by a conceptual model of social interaction in online discussions, this modeling included (a) a learner attribute capturing aspects of temporal participation, (b) social dynamics factors such as preferential attachment and reciprocity, and (c) turn- by-turn sequential patterns. Results showed that learner activity and familiarity from recent interactions affected their propensity to form ties. Turn-by-turn sequential patterns, that capture individual posting in bursts, explain how two-star network patterns form. Since two-star network patterns could further facilitate small group formation in the network, we expected the models to also capture communication in triads (i.e. triadic closure). Yet, models, devoid of the content of exchanges, did not capture the social dynamics well, and failed to predict patterns for communication across triads. By bringing in discourse features, future work can investigate the role of knowledge building behaviours in triadic closure of digital networks. This study contributes fresh insights into social interaction in online discussions, calls for attention to micro-level temporal patterns, and motivates future work to scaffold learner participation in similar contexts.","tags":["social network","educational data science","learning analytics"],"title":"Socio-Temporal Dynamics in Peer Interaction Events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bodong Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575676800,"objectID":"1f64387a7677da0d9e1a6838d9b2e088","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/talk/2019-icce-keynote/","publishdate":"2019-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-icce-keynote/","section":"talk","summary":"Knowledge creation and innovation are becoming pervasive and essential in meeting today's societal demands. This has led to increasing pressure on education to explore new pedagogical models, to move from knowledge transmission to educational paradigms that are more creative, collaborative, and connected. Knowledge Building represents a longstanding effort to redesign education as a knowledge-creating enterprise. Knowledge Building immerses learners in creative work with ideas from the earliest grades; it engages learners in continually improving knowledge of value to their class community; it challenges learners to take greater collective responsibility for their work. Students are asked to identify promising ideas, participate in meta-cognitive dialogues, play epistemic games, assess themselves, and grapple with complex, emergent knowledge structures. These competencies and high-level learner agency espoused by Knowledge Building are needed more than ever in the era of automation and A.I. In this talk, I will introduce ongoing design-research projects that attempt to further stretch students' knowledge building in classrooms to connect more deeply with the public. Overall, I posit that with proper pedagogical and socio-technical conditions learners are capable of meaningfully participating in public discourse while advancing curricular goals. In particular, I will introduce computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments we designed to support ninth graders to study 'Energy and Matter' in connection with the 'Green New Deal' in the United States; I will also showcase computational research conducted by sixth graders in relation to the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. Alongside the explication of the design principles and designed environments, I will share episodes of students' knowledge building and evidence of their knowledge advancement, expressiveness, and higher-order competencies. In doing so, I hope to challenge our entrenched beliefs about learner capabilities and highlight the potential of nurturing conditions in K-12 classrooms for knowledge building that connects with and contributes to the public good.","tags":[],"title":"Creating Conditions for Knowledge Building for the Public Good","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Bodong Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575244800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575244800,"objectID":"3abf4b0477a5c3c45655408890c7e375","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/talk/2019-pel-episteic-cultures/","publishdate":"2019-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-pel-episteic-cultures/","section":"talk","summary":"Epistemic cognition is about people's thinking about what they know and how they come to know. As a constructivist approach with unique onto-epistemological underpinnings, Knowledge Building (KB; Scardamalia \u0026 Bereiter, 2014) is deeply invested in facilitating epistemic cognition of learners. For example, the inculturation of learners into KB's theory-building discourse involves the exploration and development of learners' epistemic views; KB's supporting technology---Knowledge Forum---is built with epistemic scaffolds to promote epistemic diversity in the theory-building discourse. In this talk, I will discuss a line of research that aims to design discourse practices, tools, metrics, and analytics to promote epistemic cognition in KB. In the first study, we designed a Discourse Moves tool that visualizes epistemic diversity in a KB community. With this tool, we engaged a second grade class in metadiscourse about their discourse moves and salient concepts. Results indicated second graders' capability in reflecting on their epistemic moves and taking actions to enrich the epistemic diversity of their community. In the second study, I introduce my recent work on applying Network Science techniques to develop network representations of discourse data and derive network-based metrics of epistemic cognition. In this work, I conceptualize theory-building discourse in KB as a dynamic, multidimensional network involving epistemic agents, epistemic moves, ideas, and concepts. Epistemic cognition---of either an individual and a collective---is reflected in meta-paths and structural patterns of the multidimensional network. I will introduce nascent network-based metrics of epistemic cognition in KB discourse and discuss plans of developing analytics tools based on these metrics to promote epistemic cognition.","tags":[],"title":"Promoting Epistemic Cognition in Knowledge Building: Discourse, Tools, and Analytics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Bodong Chen"],"categories":["blog"],"content":"Following advice from a fantastic leadership coach from my university, I drafted a statement of advising philosophy in the past summer (yes the summer has already passed in MN).\nHere it is!\nPlease feel free to leave suggestions via Hypothesis annotations.\nThe other project that I haven\u0026rsquo;t accomplished this summer is to create a Résumé of Failures.

In medicine, precision medicine \u0026ldquo;takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person\u0026rdquo; when treating diseases. In business, business intelligence harnesses information and analytics to improve and optimize decisions and performance. All good stuff, right?\nIndeed, the emergence of learning analytics—now often referred to as ‘AI in Education’—was motivated by these very analogies. With more and richer data, as well as stronger data science methods, education is poised to better understand and support learning.\nHowever, as pointed out by Yong Zhao, we rarely talk about ‘side effects’ in education when discussing changes and reforms. So aren’t more of us talking about types of learning and learning cultures out of the ‘curriculum box’, or not in the mainstream accountability-centric education system.\nWork tagged with ‘learning analytics’ is probably facing the same challenges as earlier educational interventions, especially those related to the integration of EdTech in the education systems. While precision medicine is a great idea, is \u0026ldquo;precision education\u0026rdquo; necessarily a good one? If precision medicine is optimizing conditions of combating a disease, what outcomes would precision education work for? Outcomes worthwhile for whom?\nDifferent Levels of Learning Let me first turn to the ‘learning’ part in learning analytics.\nIn Stephen Sterling’s (2001) book titled Sustainable Education, he delineates three levels of learning. The first-order learning is about ‘basic’ acquisition of knowledge and skills. The second-order learning deals with ‘learning about learning’ and requires reflexitivity. The third-order learning recognizes the existing paradigm of learning and facilitates paradigmatic reconstruction to transform learning.\nOf course, such categorization is coarse to a certain degree. What is useful an exercise is to scan articles from the Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conference or the Journal of Learning Analytics (JLA) to see what learning analytics research cares about when discussing learning. I would be not surprised if many/most articles are found to deal with first-order learning, such as earning a passing grade in an introductory algebra course. This is not saying passing a course is not a worthwhile educational goal. Rather, we need to think more broadly about what learning means and entails.\nWe need more learning analytics work that pushes our views of learning, given we are now better aided by data, AI, dashboards, and so on. We need to, for instance, look at nurturing higher-order competencies as demonstrated by this JLA special issue. We need to look at nascent (or simply more natural) learning contexts that involve dynamic, messy interactions among learners, artifacts, information systems, and the physical world. Recent work on ‘Collaboration Translucence’ is one great example. We need to build ‘pedagogical biases’ (Scardamalia, 2008)—biases conducive to fresh ideas of learning—into learning analytics applications to combat traditional fixation on first-order learning, and to help educators unlearn and relearn.\nAll in all, to realize its full potential, discourse around learning analytics should not be dominantly about first-order learning. While the field is progressing steadily (e.g., penetrating into board rooms of the provost offices), we probably should set bolder educational goals for learning analytics.\nDifferent Aims of Education  “I believe that education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.” — John Dewey, My Pedagogic Creed\n Of course, we do not agree on the aims of education, like what we don’t agree on the meanings of learning, and like we don’t agree on whether pineapple can be a legitimate pizza topping.\nWhen discussing, designing, and integrating learning analytics at an educational institution, we need to recognize that the education system is multi-functional and carries a mix of very different aims like the following (Sterling, 2001):\n Liberal: To develop the individual and his/her potential Socializing: To replicate society and culture and promote citizenship Transformative: To encourage change toward a fairer society and better world Vocational: To train people for employment  There are fundamental tentions among these educational aims, fueling debates such as whether education ought to be intrinsic (an end in itself) or instrumental (a means to an end).\nJust like my prior criticism of the fixation on first-order learning, I also caution a predominant emphasis on the vocational aim of education. Indeed, graduation rates and employability are important, but only to a degree of serving individual and societal well-being. Without attending to the other aims, the vocational aim would most certainly fail to stand on its own.\nA Call for Third-Order Change If learning analytics is serving a narrow band of learning and educational aims, it may lead to changes\u0026mdash;but most likely only at the functional level.\nIn learning analytics, much work is serving the functional realm of education (not learning) that resolves into a current institution and its established system. Earlier attempts of distincting learning analytics from academic analytics were well-intended but futile. It seems academic analytics would naturally focus more on the functional side, while learning analytics could truly dig into complex processes of learning using sophisticated data science methods. Of course, both tracks are progressing. But I observe a chasm between people whose job codes are on the functional side vs. those who care about the learning side.\nFew learning analytics efforts I witness are aiming at making a third-order change; that is, to harness data analytics to see learning differently. Startups may conveniently claim to totally transform learning or disrupt education, but unfortunately many of their claims fall flat. In the adaptive learning space, for instance, we already know the story about Knewton. And we now have SmartSparrow and Squirrel AI. A problem with many “disruptive” technologies is on Day One they decide to side themselves with a dated educational paradigm and never look back. Still too often, EdTech products harnessing learning analytics merely contribute to the functional and managerial aspects of education such as tracking student progress in a prescribed curricular space. In this case, the third-order change would hardly occur.\nAnd yet, the side effects of the managerialist use of analytics in education cannot be neglected. It has been warned a long time ago that the managerialist approach tends to corrode what a ‘good education’ could be (Sterling, 2001), leading towards:\n a narrowing of what counts as achievement to that which can be measured deprofessionalization of teachers, who become technicians rather than reflective practitioners decline in teacher-led innovation a creeping up of marks over time as it is in everybody’s interests to demonstrate ‘high standards’ valuing what can be measured, rather than measuring what is valued  To move towards third-order change, analytics in education need to broaden the scene from perfecting functional/managerial/mechanistic tasks to consider complex, emergent processes in the ‘ecosystem’. At a basic level, a learning analytics application needs to be clearly positioned in the existing institutional structure in relation to the other ‘agents’ in place\u0026mdash;people and information systems.\n Looking inward into the application, rather than focusing on single variables, it could focus on a set of relations and the whole; rather than powering external evaluation of student learning (or \u0026ldquo;turning students into numbers on a teacher dashboard\u0026rdquo;), it could aim to support self-assessment and self-discovery by students; rather than striving for normative values and homogenization, it could nurture heterogeneity among learners in a class. Looking outward from the application, we need to design for a meaningful social life of learners, and to design interactions between the application and other information systems as well as \u0026lsquo;locations\u0026rsquo; of learning (Edwards \u0026amp; Usher, 2007).  To a certain degree, I’m advocating for some type of 'ecological design\u0026rsquo; of learning analytics. It’s certainly vague right now. It is clear though that the field of learning analytics needs to develop a set of principles and toolkits, things like the feminist chatbot design approach, to help ourselves achieve third-order change. How can we get there?\nReferences  Edwards, R., \u0026amp; Usher, R. (2007). Globalisation \u0026amp; Pedagogy: Space, Place and Identity. Routledge. Scardamalia, M., \u0026amp; Bereiter, C. (2008).

Worth checking\u0026hellip;\nHighlights Abstract This article investigates the types of intentionality involved in human– technology relations. It aims to augment Don Ihde’ s analysis of the relations between human beings and technological artifacts, by analyzing a number of concrete examples at the limits of Ihde’ s analysis. The article distinguishes and analyzes three types of “ cyborg intentionality,” which all involve specific blends of the human and the technological. Technologically mediated intentionality occurs when human intentionality takes place “ through” technological artifacts; hybrid intentionality occurs when the technological actually merges with the human; and composite intentionality is the addition of human intentionality and the intentionality of technological artifacts. (p. 1)\nA cyborg is a border- blurring entity, uniting both human and nonhuman elements. (p. 1)\nWhat is more, authors like Bernhard Stiegler argue that we have always been cyborgs in a sense, since technology can be seen as constitutive for humanity. For Stiegler, humanity is an invention of technology, rather than the other way round; human beings exist by realizing themselves technologically (cf. Stiegler 1998). (p. 2)\nIn this article, I will use the figure of the cyborg to reconceptualize a specific phenomenon which has long been considered to be exclusively human: the phenomenon of intentionality. (p. 2)\nIntentionality and technology (p. 2)\nIn the phenomenological tradition, especially in the existential and embodied directions it took in the work of Jaspers, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty, intentionality is the core concept to understand the relation between human beings and their world. (p. 2)\nJust like human beings can only be understood from their relation with reality, so can reality only be understood from the relation human beings have with it. (p. 2)\nDon Ihde has introduced a technological dimension in this phenomenological tradition of understanding human– world relations. In our technological culture, many of the relations we have with the world around us are either mediated by or directed at technological devices (p. 3)\nMediated intentionality (p. 3)\nIhde (1990) discerns several relationships human beings can have with technological artifacts (p. 3)\nFirstly, technologies can be embodied by their users, establishing a relationship between humans and their world (p. 3)\nSecondly, technologies can be the terminus of our experience. (p. 3)\nA third human – technology relation is the “ hermeneutic relation.” In this relation, technologies provide representations of reality, which need interpretation in order to constitute a “ perception”– like a thermomete (p. 3)\nThe fourth human – technology relation Ihde distinguishes, is the background relation, where technologies are not experienced directly, but rather create a context for our perceptions, like the humming of the air conditioning (p. 3)\nIntentionality can work through technological artifacts, it can be directed at artifacts and it can even take place against the background of them. (p. 3)\nFig. 1 Human– technology rela- tionships (Ihde 1990) (p. 3)\nExperiences like reading off a thermometer and having a telephone conversation, therefore, involve “ cyborg intentionality”– intentionality that is partly constituted by technology. (p. 4)\nIntentionality beyond mediation (p. 4)\nI would like to distinguish two other forms of intentionality related to human– technology associations. First, I would like to introduce the concept of hybrid intentionality, indicating the intentionality of human– technology hybrids, in which the human and the technological are merged into a new entity, rather than interrelated, as in Ihde’ s human– technology relations. And second, I will develop the notion of composite intentionality to indicate situations in which not only human beings have intentionality, but also the technological artifacts they are using. (p. 4)\nBecause Ihde’ s primary focus is on the relations between humans and technologies rather than the intentionalities involved, his analysis tends to blackbox the various forms of intentionality involved in these relations. (p. 4)\nIhde’ s schematic representations of human– technology relations do not only contain arrows, indicating intentionality, but also dashes, indicating a relation between entities which is not specified further. (p. 4)\nIt is precisely by investigating the nature of these dashes that a closer characterization can be developed of what can be called “ cyborg intentionality.” (p. 4)\nHybrid intentionality (p. 4)\na fifth variant could be added to Ihde ’ s (p. 4)\nYet, prior to the embodiment relation there are human– technology relations in which the human and the technological actually merge rather than “ merely” being embodied. (p. 5)\n(human/technology) → world (p. 5)\nThis fifth human– technology relation is the basis for what can be called hybrid intentionality. Rather than being a technologically mediated form of human intentionality, this form of intentionality is “ beyond the human.” (p. 5)\nto distinguish two distinct ways of moving beyond the human (p. 5)\nFirst of all, a “ posthumanist” approach can be taken (p. 5)\nwe need to take into account how the human and the technological co-constitute each other. (p. 5)\nSecond, there is a “ transhumanist” approach, which does not see human– technology relations in terms of constitution but in terms of an actual, physical fusion (p. 5)\nPeter Sloterdijk ’ s analysis of “ anthropotechnol- ogies” in his infamous lecture (p. 5)\nComposite intentionality (p. 6)\nA third form of cyborg intentionality that deserves a closer analysis, beside its mediated and hybrid variants, can be called composite intentionality. In this case, the intentionalities of technological artifacts themselves play a central role, in cooperation with the intentionalities of the human beings using these artifacts. (p. 6)\nDon Ihde elaborated the example of the sound recorder as having a different intentionality for sound than human beings have, recording background noises at a louder volume than perceived by human beings who only focus on the sounds that are meaningful to them in that specific situation (Ihde 1979: 77– 78; Ihde 1983:56;Ihde1990:102– 103). (p. 6)\nis added to human intentionality, composite intentionality comes about: a form of intentionality which results from adding technological intentionality and human intentionality. (p. 7)\nermeneutic relations always involve a technologically generated representation of the world, which inevitably is the product of a specific technological directedness at the world: thermometers focus on temperature, spectrographs on light frequencies, sonograms on how material objects reflect ultrasound. (p. 7)\nThe concept of composite intentionality, therefore, urges us to augment Ihde’ s analysis of the hermeneutic relation. There is a double intentionality involved here; one of technology toward “ its” world, and one of human beings toward the result of this technological intentionality. In other words: humans are directed here at the ways in which a technology is directed at the world. (p. 7)\nThe night photographs of Wouter Hooijmans embody the “ mildest” form of composite intentionality. Hooijmans makes landscape photographs using shutter times of several hours. This allows him to make use of starlight for exposing his pictures, which has stunning effects (p. 7)\nHooijmans’ s photographs embody an extreme mechanical makeover of the intentionality of the human vision. Contrary to the most common use of the photo camera, Hooijmans does not create instantaneous exposures, but rather “ sustained exposures.” His photographs blend together an infinite number of visual impressions into one single representation of the world, which the human eye could never produce itself. We could call this form of composite intentionality “ augmented intentionality,” since it consists in making accessible to the human eye an artificially expanded form of human intentionality. (p. 8)\nThese photographs do not aim to represent reality in any sense, but to generate a new reality which can only exist for human intentionality when it is complemented with technological intentionality. (p. 8)\nThe “ intentionality” that De Realisten gave to their stereographic camera is not directed at making visible an existing reality but at constructing a new reality. For this reason, the intentionality involved here can be called “ constructive intentionality.” (p. 8)\nConclusion (p. 8)\nIntentionality used to be one of these concepts which belonged to the realm of the exclusively human, but by now it has become clear that it needs to be extended to the realm of technology – and to the realm of human– technology amalgams (p. 8)\nBy re-articulating phenomenological and philosophical – anthropological concepts philosophers can contribute to a better understanding of the “ posthuman” or perhaps even “ transhuiman” beings we are becoming – and to the development of a better sense of the limits of humanity.

The distinction made among public/local/private interactions are congruent with my thinking on (public) online pedagogy.\nThere are two references I plan to check out.\nHighlights Some observers had already commented on the difficulty of connecting with other learners in the cMOOCs (Mackness, Mack, and Williams 2010). It turned out that supporting social interaction in the xMOOCs was proving much harder. (p. 4)\nthe “myths and paradoxes” of xMOOCs (Daniel 2012). These included number of students taught (but single-digit completion rates), value (dubious certificates of completion), purpose (disregard for outcomes and focus on posturing and profits rather than spreading learning), pedagogy (essentially behaviorism), access (mostly serving elites), and risks (MOOCs as degree mills). (p. 5)\nThis chapter summarizes one ongoing effort that is intended to inform the entire range of efforts to scale open learning. (p. 5)\nInstructionist approaches are rooted in a more “associationist” perspective on learning (e.g., Anderson 1990; Gagné 1985) which assumes that higher order knowledge can and should be broken down into smaller elements that can be individually learned, mastered, and assessed.1 This perspective is explicitly manifested in artificially intelligent tutors, like those associated with Carnegie Mellon University (Koedinger and Corbett 2006) and competency-based education (Bramante and Colby 2012) (p. 5)\nIn contrast, constructivist approaches are rooted in more “rationalist” views of learning (e.g., Glaser 1984) that emphasize the construction of higher-level conceptual schema that learners create to make sense of the world (rather than by assembling numerous smaller associations). (p. 6)\nconstructivist approaches can be very difficult to scale. This is because both the people who design a course and then the instructors and facilitators who teach that course need a lot of TPCK (technological pedagogical content knowledge; Koehler and Mishra 2008) concerning the way that disciplinary knowledge can optimally unfold within the particular technology. In many settings this knowledge will be in very short supply, very expensive, or both. (p. 6)\nParticipatory Learning and Assessment (PLA) (p. 7)\nReflecting a continued focus on participation in sociocultural practices, the larger framework that these principles formed was deemed Participatory Learning and Assessment (PLA). (p. 8)\ndrew significant inspiration from three strands of research that extended situative theories of learning into the era of digital knowledge networks. Two of these were Henry Jenkins’s (2009) notion of online “participatory culture” and studies by Ito et al. (2009) of the way young people “geek out” in interest-driven social networks. (p. 8)\nWhat distinguishes the PLA framework that emerged from these two courses were online strategies for delivering useful evidence that could be used to enhance participation, individual knowledge, and group achievement, without undermining any of them, and without compromising that evidence for making claims about the resulting knowledge or achievement. (p. 8)\nResearch and Development Context (p. 9)\nGoogle offered grants to faculty for developing MOOCs that were “more interactive than typical MOOCs.” (p. 9)\nDrawing on Hall and Rubin’s (1989) study of situated learning in mathematics classrooms, the principles distinguish between interactions that are public (presented to every member of the class and potentially beyond), local (in public but between specific peers and/or the instructor), or private (between individuals). A fourth kind of interaction, discreet (i.e., unobtrusive), was added to highlight the core PLA assumption that conventional achievement tests should be used judiciously and inconspicuously. (p. 10)\ndraw inspiration from Engle and Conant’s (2002) notions of productive disciplinary engagement (PDE). (p. 10)\nthe “multilevel” assessment model (p. 10)\n Use Public Contexts to Give Meaning to Knowledge Tools (p. 10)  1.1 Personalized learning contexts. In the Assessment BOOC, registrants were directed through a process that asked them questions about their actual or aspirational role in the education system and helped them draft a curricular aim that embodied their practices in that role to personalize their learning in the course. (p. 11)\n1.2 Networking groups. Registration information regarding primary academic domain and role was used to organize students into networking groups (manually in 2013 and automatically in 2014). Doing so structured local interactions with both similar and different peers and revealed how course content interacted with domains and roles. (p. 11)\ndiscussion forums were not used for group interaction (p. 12)\n1.3 Public course artifacts. (p. 12)\nIn contrast, all the BOOC assignments consisted of public (to the class) wikifolios that focused primarily on disciplinary practices. (p. 12)\n1.4 Relevance ranking. (p. 13)\nstudents rank the relevance of elements of disciplinary knowledge or disciplinary resources to their aim and/or role, and then justify that ranking. (p. 13)\n1.5 Personalized open educational resources (OERs). (p. 13)\nIn the BOOC, students posted OER URLs in their wikifolios; the annotated URLs were then automatically placed all together on a separate page, where students could easily review them. (p. 13)\n1.6 Streaming instructor videos. (p. 13)\nRecognize and Reward Productive Disciplinary Engagement (PDE) (p. 14)  3.2 Engagement reflections. (p. 19)\nstudents were instructed to reflect on their contextual engagement (“How suitable was your context for learning this knowledge?”), collaborative engagement (“Who else’s work and whose comments helped you learn this new knowledge?”), and consequential engagement (“What will you do differently in your context and beyond as a consequence of learning this knowledge?”). (p. 19)\nAssess Individual Knowledge Privately (p. 20)  Findings, Next Steps, and Conclusions (p. 22)\nThe first conclusion is that scaling should be done gradually. To quickly scale up to massive numbers of users, most MOOCs and MOOC platforms were forced to sacrifice interaction and personalization (p. 23)\nOur second conclusion is that scaling should be done iteratively. Our efforts were directly shaped by newer design-based research methods that emphasize the development of “local” theories in the context of reform efforts (Cobb et al. 2003). Furthermore, we conclude that such iterative refinements should be done within a coherent theoretical framework. (p. 23)\nFinally, we conclude that the PLA framework seems generally useful for guiding efforts to scale learning. (p. 23)\nthis framework can also “scale out” to large numbers of teachers in conventional online classes.

This paper reports on an undergraduate class's online discussion activities over one semester. Applying social network analysis, this study revealed a participation gap among students reflected by their varied levels of network prestige. The low-prestige group initiated equivalent volumes of interactions but were less reciprocated. In-depth analysis found the high-prestige group also advantageous in other network measures such as closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality, as well as the strength, persistence, and reciprocity of their ties. To probe potential explanations of the revealed gap, we further contrasted post content and posting behaviours between two groups. Results did not identify any significant differences in post content but found low-prestige students' participation less timely and more temporally compressed.

I am reviewing these two keynotes together because they were both slightly more technical (compared by the third keynote by Alexander) and both about addressing challenges in building models.\nRyan Baker is the founding president of the international society of Educational Data Mining (EDM), a sister community of learning analytics. His talk was focused on six important challenges faced by both EDM and learning analytics. As a keynote it almost sets a future research agenda for the community.\nFirst keynote at #LAK19 by @BakerEDMLab pic.twitter.com/EkrAAOA6qv\n\u0026mdash; Sweet San Pedro (@sweetsp) March 6, 2019  Challenges set by ⁦@BakerEDMLab⁩ #lak19 pic.twitter.com/na9aBhwwCa\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) March 6, 2019  Predictive models has been a trending topic in the community even though prediction is only one of those five EDM techniques outlined by Baker and Yacef (2009) (see also Siemens, 2013).\nI appreciated Ryan\u0026rsquo;s keynote because it pointed out a few acute problems with our current research and practice. We build models and analytics facing a serious constraint \u0026ndash; the \u0026lsquo;learning system wall\u0026rsquo; problem (Challenge #1). Learning analytics systems we build are not making lasting impact on student lives (Challenge #2). Findings from models are not necessarily interpretable (Challenge #3). We are less confident in detecting student learning in real-world scenarios (say, not in front of a computer) (Challenge #4). Our models are not generalizable across contexts (Challenge #5). Our models are not general either \u0026ndash; not built for a non-typical population (e.g. high school dropouts, Alaska students) (Challenge #6).\nThese important challenges are closely aligned with LAK19\u0026rsquo;s theme, Promoting Inclusion and Access, and vital for the long-term legitimacy of this field. Framing them in technical terms was intended to help us find practical solutions. But I started to feel less optimistic about addressing them within the next 18 years when considering the complex political, ethical, socio-technical, theoretical terrain facing these challenges.\n(Note: Expect Ryan to share more details about these challenges via Twitter soon.)\nThe second keynote by Prof. Lise Getoor was focused on Collective Reasoning as a key challenge in data mining and machine learning. She first called attention to structures in data and critiqued the widespread practice of flattening rich behavioral data into tables. Starting from this recognition, she highlighted that all decisions are structured and argued we should use multimodal, multi-relational, spatio-temporal features of data when making decisions, instead of flattening data and discarding relations.\nGetoor went further to explain Collective Reasoning and suggested constructing logial rules \u0026ndash; many of them \u0026ndash; to further support reasoning.\n.⁦@lgetoor⁩ speaks about the challenge of achieving Collective Reasoning! #lak19 pic.twitter.com/fH7DzjMh8D\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) March 7, 2019  Her group developed the Probabilistic soft logic (PSL) framework and toolkit for building probabilistic models. She then went ahead to introduce the application of PSL in a wide range of problem spaces (including MOOC discussion forums).\nSecond keynote at #LAK19 is @lgetoor presenting her approach named Probabilistic Soft Logic for #machinelearning to deal with relations, inconsistencies and inference. pic.twitter.com/fsNo64swLx\n\u0026mdash; Daniele Di Mitri (@dimstudi0) March 7, 2019  Issues discussed by Getoor spoke to my heart. In the learning sciences, we\u0026rsquo;ve been criticizing the practice of coding-and-counting approach. While part of my research has been trying to cast light on micro-temporal dynamics in learning processes, I am also interested in maintaining the complexity of learning data intact when conducting data analysis. The keynote itself did not provide more details about Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), given the time limit, so I look forward to digging into the PSL framework and tools later.\nLearning Sciences Panel On Wednesday, I moderated a Learning Sciences panel featuring Ryan Baker, Nancy Law (University of Hong Kong), Phil Winne (Simon Fraser University), and Alyssa Wise (New York University). We were charged to inspire the audience with \u0026ldquo;Design and analysis strategies that promote inclusion and increase access\u0026rdquo;. While all of our panelists had very wise things to say, we all concurred we need more expertise represented in the room.\n@bod0ng Important observation about how learning science*s* have gone far to help elucidate the political and material conditions affecting learning and what is valued about what we measure in #LearningAnalytics #LAK19\n\u0026mdash; Robin Pappas (@RobinPappas1) March 6, 2019  Near the end of the session, one of this year\u0026rsquo;s Doctoral Consortium participants Catherine Manly (UM-Amherst) mentioned her work on Universal Design for Learning.

Besides my own presentation on Value Sensitive Design, I was only able to attend a few sessions on Ethics (which I chaired), Dialogue \u0026amp; Engagement, and Reading Analytics.\nThere were many sessions I wished to attend. And I missed an important talk on the impact of learning analytics, by Shane Dowson and colleagues.\nanalysis of 522 papers thus far in#LAK: simplification, techno-centric, case studies, exploratory... similar trends in the last several years.. where is learning optimisation? how do we move the field forward in education as a complex system @shaned07 @s_joksimovic #lak19\n\u0026mdash; Sasha (@choux) March 8, 2019  Fortunately, the conference proceedings are nicely organized by sessions for us to catch up.\nSlides of my talk on Towards Value-Sensitive Learning Analytics Design can be found below. I am excited about this direction!\n  LAK19 - Towards Value-Sensitive Learning Analytics Design   Looking Ahead It has been a great LAK!\nGiven it will be LAK\u0026rsquo;s 10th anniversary, I do wonder how much this community has achieved and what needs to be down in the next 5 or 10 years.\nBelow I offer my own list of challenges:  Work with the larger system. While we\u0026rsquo;re doing detailed, careful work, it is important to make sure our work is contributing to the betterment of the larger education system. We need to connect models with design, and with feedback. We need to engage more voices in our work. We need to look at choice-making by learners besides knowledge acquisition. We need to connect learning that\u0026rsquo;s life-wide and lifelong. Move towards knowledge convergence. While we can do all sorts of cool analyses on all sorts of interesting data, we need to be an even better job on understanding learning in richer contexts. How can we put advances from multiple analytical perspectives together? Focus on impact. While there are convincing cases of data-rich educational practices, we need to invest more in studying acceptance and impact. Include one keynote speaker from a \u0026ldquo;non-WEIRD\u0026rdquo; country each year. While the society has been doing an amazing job on equity and inclusion, I would like to see a stronger representation from the Global South in the next 10 years. Ensuring voices from \u0026ldquo;non-WEIRD\u0026rdquo; countries could be a good start.  Look forward to seeing you at LAK \u0026lsquo;20 in Frankfurt, Germany.\n","date":1552189515,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552189515,"objectID":"413a806d7da28ce6ce7dfd9ff2b96ec4","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2019-03-08-lak19-part2/","publishdate":"2019-03-09T21:45:15-06:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-03-08-lak19-part2/","section":"post","summary":"(This is the second part of a report of the #LAK19 conference.

This conference, surely one of my favorites, is inching to its 10th anniversary next year. I still remember when I was in the 2nd year of my PhD in 2010, Chris Teplovs told me about an exciting, upcoming gathering of 60~ people in Banff, Canada to discuss a thing called \u0026ldquo;learning analytics.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter nearly a decade of development, we see clear progress this community has accomplished. The growth of the conference size itself, from 60 to 500+ attendees, while impressive, does not speak to the international sensation around this topic. As someone who first attended LAK as a doctoral student in 2014 and now work on a tenure-track position to grow this area at my institution, I can speak to my lived experiences of observing the rise of local interests in this topic (e.g., the \u0026ldquo;R1\u0026rdquo; university I\u0026rsquo;m part of, the state\u0026rsquo;s Department of Education), as well as an international passion for learning analytics when I travel to Singapore, Manila, and Beijing.\nThe rise of learning analytics (the field), LAK (its conference) and SoLAR (its society), coincides with many other things. In education, there is a push for \u0026ldquo;evidence-based practice\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;data use\u0026rdquo; in schools (however we mean by evidence or data). In EdTech, words like A.I., adaptive learning, personalization are mentioned in board rooms, websites of philanthropist foundations, and news headlines. Of course, an earlier surge of MOOCs and an ongoing rise of online, lifelong learning demand analytic supports while also offering fertile grounds for learning analytics to grow. In many cases, learning analytics are truly needed and making impossible things possible. But in others, it\u0026rsquo;s scooped up to be a tag on a product to drive sales.\nRealities, for better or worse, just like many other fields we can think of.\nOverall impression of LAK19 First of all, many thanks to the amazing organizing team who has done a wonderful job to make everything real and enjoyable! The program is cohesively organized; conference amenities are thoughtfully arranged; student volunteers are kind and amazingly helpful. These are on top of myself escaping -30C weather in Minnesota for the 20C dessert temperature.\nThanks #LAK19 Defrosting in progress. pic.twitter.com/C1lPgc52XE\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) March 4, 2019  As the community grows bigger, I always found multiple concurrent sessions/talks I hoped to check out. So my impression and report of this conference are surely biased.\nMonday: Full-Day Workshop on Connectivism I went to this workshops mainly for jokes among Canadians, Aussies, and Serbians :). I was sorted of disappointed because Vita was clearly jet-lagged.\nJokes aside, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a big fan of Connectivism, George Siemens, and Stephen Downes for years. Many ideas under Connectivism resonate with me, as a big part of my research is grounded in the Knowledge-Building Community model created by Scardamalia and Bereiter.\nGeorge kicked off the workshop by briefly explaining its 15-year history. Connectivism emerged in the early stage of the Read/Write web (Web 2.0) and grew out of a dissatisfaction with existing frameworks of learning that were not very helpful in explaining the construction of \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; knowledge in a networked world.\nThe core arguments made by Connectivism are:\n Knowledge is networked. This idea is in line with works from Rosen (2012), combinatorial creativity, Nielsen (2013), and Borner (network of science). Learning is the process of developing those networks. These two ideas apply beyond learning.  At this workshop, George challenged us to work on three domains where learning is networked: Neural; Cognitive/Conceptual; and Social/External. Future work on Connectivism should try to deliver quality empirical research about networks of learning at these levels, detail how things fit together, integrate networks across levels, and articulate human and artificial cognition.\nCritiques of Connectivism as a learning theory were mentioned for multiple times. It\u0026rsquo;s probably accurate to say George found these critiques fair and highlighted that Connectivism meant to provide a framework (or paradigm) to think about knowledge and learning in a fresh way. There is a vast empty space left by Connectivism, including pedagogy, learning analytics, etc.\nStephen Downes joined the workshop remotely and shared a very informative review* of recent work on connectivism. His review looked at scholars\u0026rsquo; various interpretations of connectivism, criticisms, connectivism as pedagogy (e.g., Wang, Anderson, \u0026amp; Chen 2018), connectivism as a theory of learning, and properties of a successful network. He offered a number of future directions, including critical thinking and deep learning (not the ML sense), rhizomatic learning, social networking, and cognitive cities. Listening to such a review from one of the creators was helpful.\n(*: As a strong advocate of open scholarship, Stephen may have chosen to focus this review on open-access publications.)\nComing into this workshop, I was looking for two things:\n Conceptually, I was wondering why many research papers on cMOOCs used frameworks such as the Community of Inquiry to examine connectivist learning instead of connectivism itself. I was curious about further articulation of connectivism. In terms of design \u0026ndash; of both connectivist learning environments and analytics \u0026ndash; I was looking for design principles and design ideas to inform some of our ongoing projects.  Four principles of connectivism Stephen laid out later was quite useful. These principles include:\n Autonomy of learners Diversity of learners, ideas, information, etc. Openness of the environment and process. Interactivity within the network.  I found these principles valuable even though more work is needed to further unpack and articulate them. Stephen predicted a shift is going to happen (if not yet) even if it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily tagged with connectivism.\nAt the workshop, there were several interesting research talks as well, including analyzing group communication (Nia Dowell), assessing idea development using epidemiological modeling (Sasank Peri), and modeling network dynamics (Renzhe Yu). They represented promising directions to further advance connectivism, especially in the areas of analyzing connective learning processes and developing automated indices about connective learning. Srećko Joksimović also presented findings from an ongoing bibliometric study of the connectivism literature. More details can be found on the workshop website.\nI very much appreciated the multi-level network view laid out by George and his urge for us to connect levels. These ideas are informative for my recent thinking, tinkering, and design (since 2017) to:\n Represent, describe, and model learning (at multiple levels) as complex networks Design tools for personal, connectivist learning that give learners agency to maintain their networks Brainstorm an analytical infrastructure that maintains complexity of all sorts of learning processes  Attending this workshop was a treat!\nTuesday: Workshop on Fairness It was an honor to give an invited talk about Value-Sensitive Design in learning analytics at the FairLAK workshop organized by Kenneth Holstein and Shayan Doroudi.\nIt is a timely workshop that deals with a topic that\u0026rsquo;s critical for our work in this community and beyond. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know there are 21 fairness definitions (Narayanan, 2018; Youtube video). During my limited time spent at the workshop, it is refreshing to see multiple approaches to considering fairness, ranging from creating new metric based on slice analysis to evaluate fairness in predictive models (Josh Gardner), to applying the Socio-Technical Integration Research approach to design processes.\nThe program and slides of the FairLAK workshop can be found on its website.\nTuesday: Workshop on Curriculum Development in LA Programs Stephanie Teasley and John Stamper asked me to stop by another workshop about curriculum development in learning analytics. It was half-way through after coming from the FairLAK workshop.\nCharles Lang and Leah Macfadyen showed us their informative reviews of degree programs related to learning analytics. John Stamper showed us CMU\u0026rsquo;s Master\u0026rsquo;s Educational Technology and Applied Learning Science program that interestingly integrates courses from different disciplines and connects deeply with the industry.\nFollowing Charles\u0026rsquo; lead, we even got a chance to co-design a class activity to engage students to consider and experience themselves as data producers, data analysts, and analytics consumers. I believe nurturing criticality in all course of a learning analytics program is critical. Interesting activities like this could be very helpful.\nWe discussed collectively mapping out a learning analytics curriculum. Workshop leaders will be working on compiling a list of courses and syllabi to be shared on the SoLAR website. I look forward to being part of this important work.\nOther Pre-Conference Workshops There were many interesting workshops happening at LAK.\nThe Writing Analytics workshop has generously shared their notes that I look forward to dig into. Mladen Rakovic from SFU channeled some \u0026ldquo;knowledge telling vs. knowledge transforming\u0026rdquo; wisdom (Bereiter \u0026amp; Scardamalia) I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with.\nWriting analytics for helping students move from knowledge telling to knowledge transforming in writing #WaLAK19 #LAK19 @MladenRakovic pic.twitter.com/TIb20hWbRl\n\u0026mdash; Shibani Antonette (@ShibaniAntonett) March 4, 2019  The Doctoral Consortium seemed to be going strong as well!

The first study applied Value Sensitive Design methods, specifically stakeholder analysis and value analysis, to a conceptual investigation of an existing learning analytics tool. This investigation uncovered a number of values and value tensions, leading to design trade-offs to be considered in future tool refinements. The second study holistically applied Value Sensitive Design to the design of a recommendation system for the Wikipedia WikiProjects. To proactively consider values among stakeholders, we derived a multi-stage design process that included literature analysis, empirical investigations, prototype development, community engagement, iterative testing and refinement, and continuous evaluation. By reporting on these two studies, this paper responds to a need of practical means to support ethical considerations and human values in learning analytics systems.

(p. 3)\nThe solution to the coordination problem resides in artifacts that support the collaborative process by mediating common understanding (Bruner, 1996). (p. 3)\nCollaborative artifacts represent crystallized knowledge that is preserved from past interactive situations and that can be built on in future to produce phenomena like scientific understanding, social practices or social norms (Engeström \u0026amp; Sannino, 2010; Paavola, Lipponen \u0026amp; Hakkareinen, 2004).

His study deals with pivotal knowledge within Wikipedia. He asks (1) what pivotal knowledge in Wikipedia is, and (2) who its authors are. (p. 5)\nhe operationalizes “pivotal knowledge” as articles with a central position at the macro level and distinguishes two types of pivotal knowledge: knowledge that is central within a single domain or knowledge that relates two different domains and resides at the border between them. The presentation shows that social network analysis (SNA) is an appropriate methodological approach to go about the complex large-scale and long-term patterns of creation of pivotal knowledge.

(p. 2)\nonly a few studies have started to address how work is coordinated within the crowd and how to design systems to support higher levels of innovation among crowdworkers. In particular, crowdworkers engaged with knowledge intensive and innovation activities in online platforms, such as Open Idea and Local Motors, are encouraged to collaborate intensively with each other (e.g., Fuller et al, 2011; Langner and Seidel, 2015) in co-creation processes, such as the joint creation of value by a network of diverse actors (Perks et al, 2012; Lusch and Nambinsan, 2015). (p. 2)\nmicro-level patterns of collaboration between knowledge workers impact innovation outcomes (e.g. Perry-Smith and Shalley, 2003) (p. 2)\nwe pose the following research question: How do co-creation processes unfold and predict submission quality in crowd-based open innovation and what is the role of the diversity of the crowd in this process? (p. 2)\nTheoretical Background and Hypotheses (p. 2)\nCrowd-based open innovation (p. 2)\nOpen innovation has been broadly defined to include flows of knowledge and ideas both into and outside of the organization (e.g. Dahlander and Gann, 2010; Lichtenthaler, 2011). (p. 2)\nwork has tended to focus on the firm (West et al., 2014) and not at the level of the workers called upon to enact these new forms of work. (p. 2)\nAs defined by Howe (2009), “crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined and generally large network of people in the form of an open call.” (p. 2)\nStudies suggest, for example, that monetary payments, when available, increase motivation (e.g. Boudreau et al., 2014; Brabham, 2010, 2008), but that other intrinsic factors, such as being challenged by a complex problem (Boudreau et al., 2014), developing skills (e.g. Brabham, 2010), being identified with the community and forming friendships (e.g. Brabham, 2010; Langer and Seidel, 2015), and having fun (Brabham, 2008) are all equally or more important. (p. 2)\nAlthough informative, most studies do not push beyond questions of individual motivation to understand the work itself and few consider how work is coordinated among individuals and what contributes to high quality submissions. (p. 3)\nUnpacking co-creation processes in crowd-based open innovation (p. 3)\nAccording to Perks et al. (2012) and Lusch and Nambinsan (2015), co-creation involves the joint creation of value. “Innovations are thus the outcomes of behaviors and interactions between individuals and organizations” (Perks et al., 2012: 935). (p. 3)\nThus, even if they have promising ideas for a challenge, creators are not always able, alone, to refine and develop them into coherent submissions (Kittur et al., 2013). (p. 3)\nthe theoretical framework proposed by Lusch and Nambisan (2015) underscores the importance of the processes that lead to knowledge integration within a network of heterogenous actors and calls for more research on the micro-dynamics of co-creation, e.g. on the different roles played by diverse actors. In a similar vein, Storbacka et al. (2016) call for more research on co-creation that unpacks how different actors engage with each other. (p. 3)\nFewer works, however, have examined how heterogeneous actors involved in co-creation collaborate among themselves, how this evolves over time, and the outcomes of these collaborative processes (see Lusch \u0026amp; Nambisan, 2015; Storbacka et al., 2016). (p. 3)\nOne exception is the work of Perks et al. (2012), who investigated the micro-level processes of co-creation and identified two interaction patterns in a network of customers, suppliers, distributors, and intermediaries in the car insurance industry. They found, for example, that successful outcomes often involved high levels of intense interactions among contributors. (p. 3)\nThe literature on how creative workers build relationships (e.g., Perry-Smith and Shalley, 2003), interact and exchange feedback (e.g., Perlow, 1999; Harrison and Rouse, 2015; Hargadon and Bechky, 2006), and coordinate their efforts (e.g. Bechky, 2006) is well established and offers important insights into collaboration practices that foster innovative outcomes. (p. 3)\nA handful of recent studies have also begun to examine interactions in teams composed of crowdworkers (e.g., Retelny et al., 2014; Valentine et al., 2017; Riedl and Wooley, 2017). (p. 4)\nRiedl and Woolley also reported that more successful crowdsourcing teams were characterized by “synchrony” dynamics (p. 4)\nTeams that exchanged more diverse information among team members also performed better. (p. 4)\nbut extant research leaves us without a clear understanding of which patterns and sequences of interactions, over time, exemplify co-creation, and their influence on innovation outcomes. The objective of our work is thus to unpack the concept of co-creation and identify the core interaction patterns, or “signatures” that make it successful. (p. 4)\nThus, we focus on how the co-creation patterns contribute to completion and refinement of ideas, i.e. on submission quality. (p. 4)\nHypotheses (p. 4)\nH1 A submission is more likely to be of higher quality if, over time, the number of different contributors (sources) posting on a design idea decreases. (p. 5)\nH2 A submission is more likely to be of higher quality if, over time, posts are coming from a smaller number of community members who emerge as proportionately dominant. (p. 5)\nH3 A submission is less likely to be of higher quality if the creator is proportionally dominant, e.g. responsible for the majority of posts. (p. 5)\nH4 A submission is more likely to be of higher quality if, over time, the creators’ responses to posts from community members escalates. (p. 6)\nData and Method (p. 6)\nResearch Context (p. 6)\nLocal Motors (LM) is a manufacturing company founded in 2007 with the initial aim of becoming the first organization developing an open-source car in collaboration with an online community. (p. 6)\nLM was an ideal company for our study because crowd-based open innovation is a strategic emphasis, and they are engaged on a day-to-day basis with the contributions from their online community. (p. 6)\nData Collection (p. 6)\nWe collected data from multiple sources, both qualitative and quantitative, to have a rich and detailed understanding of community members’ behaviors. (p. 6)\nPreliminary Interviews with Online Community Members and LM Community Managers (p. 6)\nWe conducted 13 preliminary interviews with 10 online community members, i.e., external contributors who participated in the challenges, and 3 LM community managers (p. 6)\nThese interviews were used exclusively as a foundation for the authors to better understand the context and make informed decisions about how to design our data collection and analysis (p. 6)\nData from the Online Platform on Project REDACTED and the Airbus Cargo Drone Challenge (p. 7)\nWe downloaded all data from the community’s message archives (web log of interactions) during the timeframe of the two contests (i.e., from the initial post of the design brief to the announcement of the winners). In particular, we collected data on all the interactions exchanged by 600 community members and employees during the online contest (consisting of more than 10.000 posts). We downloaded information about the sender of each posting, timing, subject, and message content. We also downloaded demographic and personal information about community members to use as controls. (p. 7)\nCoding of Data from the Online Platform (p. 7)\nwe collected information on the timestamp, sender, entry, and content of every comment logged across all entries (p. 7)\nif User A left a comment on Submission B at Time T, with Message K, we would log the observed data point as a tuple of information (A, B, T, K). Our full dataset is then a collection of such tuples, which are grouped by entry and sorted by the time of the post. (p. 7)\nSequence statistics (p. 7)\nPut another way, we want to use numerical descriptions of past behavior, which we call signatures, to predict future behavior (Leenders, Contractor, \u0026amp; DeChurch, 2016). (p. 7)\nto examine these signatures or interaction patterns over time, we created sequence statistics that capture interaction events (posts) on a creator’s entry over the course of the design challenges. These measures are a post-by-post indicator of who is contributing to an entry. (p. 7)\nSubmission Quality (p. 7)\nTable 1. Summary of Sequence Statistics (p. 8)\nonly 45% follow (p. 8)\ned the requirements and were considered ‘complete’ and thus accepted for evaluation. (p. 8)\nAcceptance of a design for evaluation is therefore a proxy for submission quality, distinguishing between higher quality submissions (i.e. those meeting the requirements and being accepted for evaluation=1) and lower quality submissions (i.e. those not meeting the requirements and not being accepted for evaluation=0). (p. 8)\nRelational Event Modeling Analysis (p. 9)\nExplaining communication sequences (p. 9)\nthe relational event model (REM), which is a statistical framework for analyzing sequences of actions and interactions, or relational events (Butts 2008). (p. 9)\nThis model builds on temporal social network analytic techniques, but emphasizes the role of short-term linkages occurring in sequence (Quintane et al. 2013). We define the rate of activity by an individual 𝑖𝑖 on a particular forum 𝑗𝑗 as the following: (p. 9)\nThe resulting parameter estimates 𝜃𝜃 thus capture the overarching patterns observed across entries, as determined by the sequence statistics we previously defined. (p. 9)\nDifferentiating Quality Submissions (p. 9)\nThis approach is similar to the ANCOVA methodology used by Johnson and Faraj (2011) to delineate network patterns across online communities, as well as the moderation approach of Schecter et al. (2017) to characterize behaviors of teams based on variations in emergent constructs. (p. 9)\nWe differentiate our approach from a typical causal inference model; rather than predict the outcome as a function of some antecedents, we characterize an outcome by the underlying process associated with it. In this way, we avoid claiming that a pattern or measure is better or worse, or that a specific sequence leads to a specific result. Rather, we determine if specific variations in certain behaviors are systematically associated with different outcomes. (p. 10)\nResults (p. 10)\nHypothesis Testing (p. 11)\nTo test our four main hypotheses, we conduct relational event analysis. We apply a step-wise approach in which we add additional model terms and determine if there is significant improvement in fit. Our first model (Model 1) contains only the main effects, measured across all entries. Our second model includes these main effects, but also includes number of posts, number of users, and competition version as crossentry controls (Model 2). Finally, our third model includes all prior terms and also differentiates between completed entries and those that were not completed (Model 3). The parameter results for these models are presented in Table 3. Based on reduction in deviance, AIC, and BIC values, we conclude that Model 3 provides the strongest fit to our data. (p. 11)\nLooking first at the main effects (Model 3), we see that, overall, entries tended to have increased diversity over time. That is, over time, different contributors posting to creators’ entries escalated. (p. 11)\nme, it is more likely that 41 quality submissions as compared to low quality submissions, over time, the diversity of contributors to the feedback originates from a smaller number of individuals (other than the creator) in high quality entries as compared to low quality entries,. This finding lends support to Hypothesis 1, suggesting escalating diversity across all submissions, but much less so in high quality submissions. Second, we find a positive and quality submissions (𝛽𝛽 = 1.57, 𝑝𝑝 \u0026lt; 0.001). This result indicates that as interactions revolving around a significant tendency for centralization of contributors over time in high quality as compared with low 42 high-quality submission progresses, feedback is significantly more likely to originate from a small number high quality entries, the creator has a lower overall tendency to post, relative to other contributors (𝛽𝛽 = 44 We also performed additional analyses for robustness which are not included in this manuscript for sake of brevity. Specifically, we tested a variety of interaction terms, as well as a curvilinear effect for diversity. We found that none of the variance associated with these terms across entries explained variance in outcomes among the entries. Surprisingly, this analysis suggests that there is not a point at which increasing diversity has a positive effect. That is, even small amounts of increasing diversity over time were associated with lower submission quality. of active contributors, proving support for Hypothesis 2. Third, as hypothesized (H3), we observe that in −1.20, 𝑝𝑝 \u0026lt; 0.001). In other words, for high quality submissions, the creator of an entry does not dominate to feedback more, over time, in high quality submissions, as compared with low quality submissions (𝛽𝛽 = 43 the discussion of their own idea. Finally, we find a positive and significant tendency for creators to respond 1.21, 𝑝𝑝 \u0026lt; 0.001). Thus, as an entry accumulates more contributor feedback over time, creators of high quality submissions are more likely to respond to and engage with the feedback in the later stages of the context. This result lends support to Hypothesis 4. (p. 11)\nDiscussion (p. 12)\nIn doing so, we respond to the calls for more research on the micro-mechanisms of co-creation (e.g., Lusch and Nambisan; Storbacka et al., 2016). (p. 12)\nWith regard to diversity, our results show that there is a tendency in the overall sample for more unique contributors to flock to an entry over time, but the entries that are most successful have fewer contributors over time. (p. 13)\nin high quality submissions, feedback to the creator tends to originate from a smaller number of individuals, and these individuals are significantly more active relative to other contributors as the project moves from idea generation to elaboration. (p. 13)\nthe creators of more successful submissions, while not dominating the discussion, are particularly responsive to feedback in later stages. (p. 13)\nOne of the primary contributions of this research is that we were able to detect different interaction patterns over time and their effects. (p. 13)\nFinally, in analyzing the patterns of interactions between actors, we did not consider the role played by the content of the messages exchanged.

Our univeristy library system also provides support for Open Access including an Open Access Publishing Fund, a Digital Conservancy system, a Research Data Repository, etc. Not to mention my college is spearheading the Open Textbook Library.\nIn this post, I am writing up a few vignettes based on my humble journey with Open Access.\nBeing Aware In 2009, I became aware of Open Access during a talk at Beijing Normal (probably given by Stian Haklev). At that time, he was finishing up his master\u0026rsquo;s thesis on \u0026ldquo;top-quality open courses in China,\u0026rdquo; and P2PU he co-founded was still an emerging thing.\nOpen access, Open license, \u0026quot;Free Speech/Beer\u0026quot;, Peer production, Yochai Benkler, P2PU, CMU OLI, Stephen Downes, SLL...

Leslie Chan, a professor from University of Toronto at Scarborough, and Stian were running a panel in the OISE library. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what they were presenting but I\u0026rsquo;m quite sure their arguments were so eloquent that I became invested in Open Access on that day.\nSharing Drafts, Posting Preprints Yesterday, I participated in a fun discussion with colleagues from the Office of Innovation at the University of Michigan about my paper about \u0026ldquo;unLMS\u0026rdquo;. Interestingly, this paper has yet to be included in a formal, printed issue of the journal TechTrends.\nGreat turnout for brown bag lunch with guest @bod0ng on networked collaborative discourse @UMichiganAI @rebquintana pic.twitter.com/fwe2thdsJE\n\u0026mdash; Nobuko Fujita (@nobukofujita) October 26, 2018  Here is the timeline of this particular piece of work:\nIn April 2017, I started an open manuscript on Authorea.\nIn June 2017, before submitting this paper to TechTrends, I openly invitated colleagues on Twitter to comment on this manscripts. I received a bunch of comments from Stian, which I incorporated into the submitted version.\nIn Jan 2018, I uploaded a preprint on the Open Science Framework. Jeremy Dean from Hypothes.is chimed in on Authorea later in Jan 2018 and we eventually met in June 2018 at the I Annotate conference in San Francisco.\nOn April 22, 2018, after going through two rounds of revisions (with great comments from reviewers and the editor), the article was publised \u0026ldquo;Online First\u0026rdquo; in TechTrends.\nTill now, October 2018, this article is still in its \u0026ldquo;Online First\u0026rdquo; status and may get included in an issue next year. However:\n its first version on Authorea has been annotated 24 times its OSF preprint has been downloaded 89 times its Springer \u0026ldquo;Online First\u0026rdquo; version has been downloaded 89 times, shared 14 times, and annotated 43 times  From its inception in 2017 to its \u0026ldquo;formal\u0026rdquo; appearance in a printed issue in 2019, a whole lot has happened to this particular work. Indeed, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent extra hours to make things work (e.g., converting between document formats, uploading to OSF). But this journey, which I did not anticipate in the beginning, has been extremely rewarding. This article may not be my seminal work, but it is reassuring that by doing bits and pieces related to Open Access, we as researchers can (1) receive feedback from a broader audience, (2) make valuable connections with colleagues, and (3) get our work read and discussed \u0026ndash; much earlier than its formal publication.\nVoicing the Stance Despite the power of Open Access \u0026ndash; and more broadly, Open Scholarship \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced so far, it is unfortunate some disciplines and some tenure committees (not mine) would bluntly equate Open Access with \u0026ldquo;lesser quality.\u0026quot; The tyranny of metrics is worth a separate post. But here I want to share a statement related to Open Access I decided to include in my dossier (as a tenure-track professor):\n As an interdisciplinary scholar, I seek to publish in refereed journals from various fields of research, including learning sciences, educational technology, educational psychology, and learning analytics.\nAs an advocate of Open Scholarship, I also attempt to balance my publication venues between “traditional” journals and quality open-access alternatives.\nAs a scholar with Chinese heritage, I also write for audiences who speak my mother tongue.\n Despite 10 years of #OpenAccessWeek, we still have a long way to go to make \u0026ldquo;Invisible Labour\u0026rdquo; in Open Scholarship visible and valued.

Data were obtained from student groups’ online discussion of their STEM projects. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses of student groups’ knowledge-building activities, including fostering a strong sense of community, working productively with ideas, and assuming higher-level agency, provided evidence of students’ deep engagement in the design of their STEM projects.

Its openness adds another important piece that\u0026rsquo;s a bit murkier. What does it mean to share out annotations publicly \u0026ndash; to academics who annotate, to authors of an annotated article, and to academia?\nMeeting with Pratim Sengupta, whose work was annotated by myself when running a journal club with a dozen grad students, just gave me a chance to really ponder on these questions. He and his team\u0026rsquo;s work on public computing inspires my evolving thinking on the value of openness.\nMy thinking is also contextualized in my recent attendance to the I Annotate conference and the idea of creating \u0026lsquo;A Coalition for Scholarly Annotation\u0026rsquo; shared by Jon Udell. My key takeaway from the conference was that the web annotation community has been thinking deeply about web information, knowledge and workflows. Their work has generated nascent web standards, tools and practices that are making an impact on publishing, information \u0026lsquo;consumption\u0026rsquo;, and human collaboration on the web.\nNow enters this blog post This post will be an evolving document reflecting my ongoing thinking on open scholarly annotation. Writing this blog post is a new experiment. I admit my bias upfront. That is, I strongly believe scholarly annotations generated at various stages of the scholarly process are of great value. However, these annotations have become part of the \u0026lsquo;dark data\u0026rsquo; generated by scholars and are rarely talked about. While research reproducibility has been embraced by many disciplines and scholarly communities, how we actually \u0026lsquo;annotate\u0026rsquo; each other\u0026rsquo;s ideas into new ones remains opaque. Remaining in the dark is not doing justice to hidden value we produce as scholars and is not helping with the training of emerging scholars. Further enriching openness in scholarly practices \u0026ndash; even beyond open data and analysis reproducibility \u0026ndash; would be a meaningful next step.\nPhase 1 of writing this post In Phase 1, I will publicly annotate web documents about open scholarly annotation, using Hypothes.is and a tag ValueAnnotation. Below is an evolving collection of my annotations, and I invite you to annotate with me using the same tag.\n --  Here is an example of a Hypothesis annotation I created.\nPhase 2 This is an emerging process. The next step, as I see now, is to make sense of generated annotations and update this post with summaries and new ideas that \u0026lsquo;rise above\u0026rsquo; existing ones.\n Update (2018-7-20): In preparation for an AERA 2019 submission, I wrote a research summary describing what I hope to do next.

I am not knowledgeable enough to explain why. But I had lived experiences with buying bulky textbooks for $200 and using them as laptop stands after a single use. They are from respected textbook publishers (like SAGE) and are indeed well-written. But \u0026hellip; there could be 100 reasons why a textbook should not cost that much.\nMore importantly, the notion of ‘a textbook’ has evolved, at least for some disciplines. In many fields that are fast-evolving, textbooks written today will become dated in two years. Also, one textbook can rarely fulfill needs of a course, making it necessary to introduce fresh texts and multimedia content from the ‘open world’. Digital tools, such as H5P and Colaboratory, offer richer modalities, interoperability, and interactivity for learning in comparison with traditional paper books.\nMore profoundly, the conceptualization of a textbook as a container of knowledge to be acquired by students is challenged by ‘new cultures of learning’ that de-emphasize ‘knowledge as stocks’ and value learning as \u0026lsquo;participating in a flow of knowledge production\u0026rsquo;. Instructors can surely do inspiring things with a traditional textbook, but grounding principles of Open Educational Resources (OER) almost automatically make a philosophical statement that draws one’s teaching closer to new cultures of learning. It’s the (promised) paradigm shift behind OER (and open textbooks) that attracts me, besides cost concerns mentioned above.\nAnd, by the way, these changes are not limited to textbooks, but also scholarly knowledge production in general.\nOpen educational practices So my thinking on OER are tilted towards ‘open educational practices’. In addition to making my course content open (on Github for example), I am also interested in:\n Open participation — that does not limit participation within a socially, spatiotemporally, and technologically bounded environment Student agency and voice — that give students a say about what to learn and how to learn Connected learning and networked scholarship opportunities — that present a fuller picture of learning  In a design case I recently published in TechTrends, an EdTech journal, I introduce in great details about a course I designed with these ideas in mind. I wrote a course handbook, which is essentially a compilation of OER, and incorporated tools like Hypothes.is and Slack to facilitate collaborative discourse.\nIt would be fun to integrate more ‘open pedagogy’ ideas in the next iteration of this course. Maybe asking students to rewrite the handbook. Maybe setting up open Jupyter Notebooks for students to fork, remix, and redistribute.\nWhat does this mean for faculty members? \u0026quot;use their free time\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;on top of their day-to-day work, often only receiving relatively small grants as compensation\u0026quot; 🤔 Bit problematic framing of OER production, as if it\u0026#39;s done by amateurs, out of love.\n\u0026mdash; Ewout ter Haar (@ewout) April 19, 2018  It’s a good critique. Free-time is an unfamiliar word for many academics. The idea of teaching online is already facing push-backs over the years. Structural supports for faculty members are needed to make OER production sustainable. Supporting broader acceptance of OER and open educational practices also requires cultural shifts within an institution, which is often hard to bring about.\n","date":1524528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524528000,"objectID":"f12a9bdc67e7bf82262f3297acc8f5db","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2018-04-24-open-textbooks/","publishdate":"2018-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-04-24-open-textbooks/","section":"post","summary":"I was included in an MN Daily story about open textbooks last week.

The intimate connection between us with screens has been built into another piece of technology.\n(Image Source)\n\u0026ldquo;Say Something in English\u0026rdquo; On a workday, my pre-schooler son and I were playing in a playground in Shanghai. There were a bunch of other kids \u0026ndash; mostly younger \u0026ndash; also playing there. My son always prefers talking with me in Mandarin but may entertain with a few English words from time to time. Then there was a dad with his young daughter (approximately 2 years old). It didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for him to make a request to his daughter: \u0026ldquo;Baby, can you say something in English?\u0026quot; The same thing happened again the next day in a park.\nA few days later when I was in my hometown, a small town in Western China, I visited a newly built factory where an uncle works. This factory manufactures food supplements with nutritions extracted from traditional Chinese herbs. I somehow ended up meeting with their young sales team, which was made of four fresh college graduates. They were in their early 20s, and two of them graduated from the same high school I attended. Then I began to learn about their goals of taking over their international sales from intermediaries located in costal areas. They were not confident in their English capabilities though and showed tremendous interests in Western culture(s).\nMy biggest dream while growing up in my hometown was to go to college in Shanghai or Beijing. Now it seems people living in my hometown are aspiring to ride the tide of globalization. It may be still difficult to attract or retain necessary talents. But they have lofty goals. The new factory aims to become a listed company in 15 years.\n\u0026ldquo;I accept both WeChat and Zhifubao\u0026rdquo; Riding on a taxi from Shanghai Pudong Airport to a hotel, I noticed two QR codes attached to the dashboard of the taxi.\n\u0026ldquo;I accept both WeChat and Zhifubao,\u0026rdquo; said the driver when we arrived. And he taught me how to use them on the fly.\nThis time around, I could basically go cash-free everywhere in China.\n\u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t see the point.\u0026rdquo; During my stay at Beijing Normal, I taught a few classes on topics such as MOOCs and learning analytics. In a graduate-level class, a professor introduced to us a project aiming to build a recommender engine to help highschool students choose subjects in the newly reformed college entrance exam. The recommender engine will be based on a wide range of factors, including previous performance, personality traits, competitiveness of the student\u0026rsquo;s aspired college, and so on.\nOne student said, \u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t see the point.\u0026quot; Her argument was this choice is too high-stake and too personal. She would like to make the choice on her own even if the recommendation is meant to be informational.\nShe had a point.

In order to foster student discussion in online classes, we devised an analytics toolkit that turns discussion forum data into information for students to reflect upon. The first pilot study conducted in an online course showed both early promises and challenges with this effort. In particular, students reported usefulness of the toolkit for monitoring posting behaviors and setting participation goals. Content analysis of post content linked tool usage with students' increased attempts to solicit peer responses to their posts and increased reflection on individual participation. However, the tool was not found useful or easy to use by some students, and it did not show benefits in other aspects of online discussion, such as crafting stronger argumentation or reflecting on group processes. These findings highlight the need of social learning analytics to strive for tool simplicity, scaffold students' development in data literacy, and bring analytics and pedagogical designs into close coordination.","tags":["Learning Analytics","Higher Education"],"title":"Fostering student engagement in online discussion through social learning analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qijie Cai","Bodong Chen","Han Wu","Glenn Trussell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514786400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514786400,"objectID":"bcdd09d7e7600d1e4bbaad9f008926b5","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/publication/cai2018-za/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cai2018-za/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, we applied the regulatory focus theory todesign a feedback intervention to promote learning in anintroductory statistics course at a Midwestern public universityin the USA.

He helped us unpacking two important criteria of scientific research: credibility and legitimacy. Equally helpful was a recognition that transparency encompasses production transparency (the production of data) and analytic transparency (how a scholar goes from data to knowledge claims). He shared important resources from the DA-RT: Data Access and Research Transparency initiative and its TOP Guidelines, supported by 29 top journals across disciplines. He shared preliminary evidence of \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; things like the CoS Badges can effectively spur the adoption of data sharing \u0026amp; research transparency practices. Finally, it was so refreshing to hear that those data sharing initiatives have been and are being championed by qualitative researchers. Data sharing is indeed doable for qualitative researchers and how qualitative researchers perceive data (and I guess more specifically their ontological and epistemological commitments) are of great value to data sharing practices. This is a very important and mindbolging message that I did not expect before this workshop.\nThree recognized data sharing repositories \u0026mdash; Inter‐university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) (UMich), Databrary (PSU \u0026amp; NYU), and Qualitative Data Repository (QDR) (Syracuse) \u0026mdash; and their leaders/PIs presented as a panel. It was encouraging to see: 1) ICPSR\u0026rsquo;s long record of data sharing/archiving since 1962; 2) QDR as a repository focusing on qualitative data; and 3) \u0026ldquo;even\u0026rdquo; research videos are also sharable on Databrary. AERA is partnering with ICPSR to set up a dedicated repository for AERA journals, in line with AERA\u0026rsquo;s forthcoming policies on data sharing. Important questions were asked about possible impact on international researchers \u0026mdash; and non-WEIRED populations \u0026mdash; who are automatically excluded by some data repositories\u0026rsquo; requirements of IRB approvals that are nonexistent in some countries/regions. For me, it was encouraging to learn existing templates and guidelines made available by data sharing repositories that I could refactor for IRB protocols of my projects. Together with emerging policies made by funding agencies, professional associations, and journals, I can feel more confident about pursuing data sharing (as much as possible) when proposing a study.\nIt was exiting to hear from Maggie Levenstein (Director of ICPSR) about work on researcher credential building blocks that\u0026rsquo;s under way. Their framework of credentials includes a researcher\u0026rsquo;s status (incl. academic, geographic, demographics), affiliation, training (e.g., in data sharing), access level, prior contributions, and violations of data stewardship. While companies like ResearchGate are inventing scores to determine researchers\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;status,\u0026rdquo; why not build a non-proprietary system to enable positive feedback loop for data sharing? A researcher credentialing system with an emphasis on data sharing could raise awareness of data sharing, give credits to those who share, and maintain reputation of data users. Exciting stuff!\nOf course, there are still so many issues to be sorted out, especially from an editor\u0026rsquo;s standpoint, who may constantly face work overload and not wish to add another layer to a journal\u0026rsquo;s production pipeline. Extremely legitimate. As an early career scholar, I\u0026rsquo;m quite blind to many challenges an editor or an association\u0026rsquo;s president might be thinking about. Fortunately colleagues running data repositories may have a lot to offer.\nIt was helpful to hear from Lupia on the third day about multiple levels and multiple dimensions a journal can consider when implementing data sharing practices. Check out this one-pager explaining 8 modular standards and 3 levels. From the lowest level, for example, a journal could encourage \u0026mdash; instead of requiring \u0026mdash; authors to put data into a repository. In terms of dimensions, a journal could consider change of citation practices to reinforce secondary datasets being cited, require preregistration of (causal-inferential) research, encourage replication studies, nurture analytic transparency by asking authors to share code, and so forth. As our JLS co-editor-in-chief Susan Yoon nicely worded, \u0026ldquo;it seems the train has already departed, and we need to catch it.\u0026rdquo; I was thinking about a slightly different metaphor based on my experiences playing \u0026ldquo;Real-Time Strategy Games\u0026rdquo;: there are multiple pathways towards winning a game (e.g., defeating an opponent), and doing one thing (such as collecting a lot of lamber) may unlock other components of winning; further, in a game that requires teamwork, one player (e.g., a journal editor) could focus on one component (e.g., collecting lamber) and share to teammates, while other teammates (e.g., community advocates, data repositories) could handle other parts. We should not drain an editorial team\u0026rsquo;s limited resources to achieve everything overnight; rather, maybe we could create a roadmap that involves multiple types of contributors \u0026mdash; authors, editors, data sharing services, funders, and maybe also publishers (for-profit or not).\nFunding agencies have been actively looking into data sharing. For instance, discussions on data and data stewardship are central to NSF Programs such as smart and connected communities and Internet of Things. NIH has 71 data repositories and is very active in Genomic data sharing. To a great extent, broader impacts sought by funding agencies could become more achievable if research data \u0026mdash; collected with support from tax-payer dollars \u0026mdash; are not sitting in one team\u0026rsquo;s private server for 10 years but instead shared carefully, ethically, and with proper restrictions.\nLike a colleague nicely said:\n Data sharing is not a thing in addition to doing science. Data sharing is doing science.\n Action Items A collective resolution has been reached near the end of the workshop and is likely to be shared by AERA soon. Below are action items that seem to me thinkable \u0026mdash; if not yet feasible \u0026mdash; for different players.\n(Disclaimer: These items are in many cases my personal takeaways and do not represent official policies from funding agencies or professional associations. Some ideas are based on group discussion but may not accurately reflect what was originally said.)\nIndividual researchers. Study issues related to research transparency, reproducibility, replicability, etc. Get familiar with terms like p-hacking, preregistration, reproducible research, preprints, Research Objects, etc. Take a hard look at our own research workflows and think about potential transparency/reproducibility hazards \u0026mdash; which could be related to how we name files, store research memos, document R codes, backup data, etc. Stay current with existing data sharing guidelines from funders, journals, and research societies \u0026mdash; as the train has ignited its engine if not yet departed. Seek support from our institutions, libraries, data stewards, etc. For those ahead of the game, publish your codes in Github, package algorithms in an R package, etc.\nA very important point made by Robyn Read (an early career peer \u0026amp; also an OISE alumnus): academia has been quite intolerant of failures and mistakes. We get afraid of missteps at every stage of a research project. How about making peer-review more collaborative? How about putting drafts/preprints out there early on for open discussions (see this paper originally shared as a draft)? There are certain norms in academia possibly ripe for disruption (a word I typically don\u0026rsquo;t like using).\nFaculty members. Engage students in conversations, in our labs or methodology courses. Point them to training resources on campus or online (webinars, MOOCs, manuals). Help them stay calm, even when we aren\u0026rsquo;t :-). Maybe even develop new courses about research transparency and reproducible research \u0026mdash; typically nonexistent in colleges of Education.\nReproducibility Guide from the R and rOpenSci communities https://t.co/e7DA5PP16h #DataSharing #openscience\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) July 26, 2017  Professional associations and their journals. Convey messages to association members and share exemplars. Expect non-supportive reactions and resistance. Treat resistance as good opportunities of conversations, as a colleague said. Engage members \u0026mdash; esp. international members \u0026mdash; in conversations about data sharing at board meetings, conferences, webinars, doctoral consortia, etc. Talk with other journals under a same society, journals in a same field by \u0026ldquo;reside\u0026rdquo; somewhere else, and journals from other fields. Identify early-starters of data sharing and engage them in training and conversations. Maybe consider a new award category for data sharing or research transparency/reproducibility (suggested by Skip).\nData repositories. I look forward to digging into datasets already living in those repositories and studying their resources for IRB preparation. For example, to me knowing data sharing is not the same as making data totally open to anyone was helpful (see the tweet below). It would be very useful if data repositories could further provide dataset exemplars. A 3-minute video walkthrough about the process of depositing a dataset will also help. These resources would help us get a more concrete understanding of data sharing.\nOne example ICPSR dataset showing ways to protect data: the words #DataSharing sound scary but there are strategies https://t.co/MfZqqUSWxf pic.twitter.com/FUpfc3SZNh\n\u0026mdash; Bodong Chen (@bod0ng) July 26, 2017  Universities and research institutions. IRB practices are evolving as well. My institution, the University of Minnesota, hosted IRB Town Halls last academic year discussing the changing landscape of Compliance \u0026amp; Ethics. Engage IRB offices in data sharing conversations, if not yet. Also important is a university\u0026rsquo;s willingness to back up its researchers\u0026rsquo; ethical data sharing practices and stand with them against possible vicious attacks. Just like many universities are backing up their faculty members\u0026rsquo; fair-use claims.\nTowards My Dream World This workshop was so helpful in getting me to think more deeply about data sharing and possible actions I can take as a researcher, faculty member, new investigator, author, international person whose home country\u0026rsquo;s ethical review practice is still emerging.\nBelow I explore a few other components touched upon (implicitly) during the workshop. I am quite excited about them even though they are still vague and paradoxical to me, or are totally against our current norms and routines. So I\u0026rsquo;m now throwing them out there for further discussions.\nControl. Before attending the workshop, I thought data sharing is to put data out there \u0026mdash; totally public and totally beyond one\u0026rsquo;s control after data get shared. That is a scary scene for many of us. As researchers, we can still remain a certain level of control over a shared dataset \u0026mdash; not based on whether we like a data requester or whether a requested usage contradicts our published findings.. But it seems controls pre- and post-sharing are areas that could be further discussed.\nHere I\u0026rsquo;m especially curious about possible controls after data sharing (post-sharing). Linked to work on researcher credentials, data repositories could have an opportunity to think twice about a data request from someone with many previous violations. For data sharers, they may wish to be able to track who are accessing my shared data, how, and where results are published; so are data repositories.\nRelated to post-sharing controls, we also image a shared dataset to keep evolving after secondary analysts invest time to recode, reshape, or link them. When we allow a new version of a dataset to appear? Or do we allow a dataset to fork? Who can make these judgements? Intriguing questions.\nHow about research participants? While our currently practices seek clearcut delimiters of data ownership/stewardship in a lifecycle of project. For example, when an informed consent is made, we say data ownership is transferred from a participant to a researcher; similarly, when a dataset gets submitted to shared to a repository after de-identification, we see another change of data ownership and stewardship. However, in a deeply connected world, should research participants remain control of their own data? Would it be more ethical if participants have the choice to stay aware of work conducted on data they contributed \u0026mdash; while remaining hidden from data users? This may seem totally quite counter-intuitive. But see yourself the Kavli HUMAN project, the shift from an Internet of Information to an Internet of Actions, and a move to store medical records on blockchains.\n Ubiquitous networking has transformed cyberspace into a pervasive layer atop our physical reality. (source)\n What\u0026rsquo;re the implications on research data? What does it mean to data sharing?\nLinked data and maintained contexts. Information loss accompanies the lifecycle of research data \u0026ndash; from collection, cleansing, transformation, analysis, synthesis, publication, to meta-analysis\u0026hellip; We are increasingly losing the context where data were originally collected. In a \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; connected world, as described above, how about data sharing is not too distant from where data originally reside? Data sharing is just like adding faces and masks to data and selectively expose data to secondary users? In my experiences with secondary data, I saw data shared in forms PDFs, CSVs, Excels, JSONs, and XMLs. How about we say those data formats or shapes all suck, and we wish to (safely \u0026amp; ethically) maintain possible connectivity when sharing data instead of cutting connections?\nBroader conceptions of value and incentives. I shared an idea in a breakout group discussion about crediting data sharers with a crypto- or digital currency, with which they can \u0026ldquo;purchase\u0026rdquo; other data. Like the Ethereum blockchain, data sharers share data with \u0026ldquo;smart contracts\u0026rdquo; attached to them and users \u0026ldquo;pay\u0026rdquo; a price in a digital currency based on their status (e.g. free for a student or a researcher without funding, a fair amount for someone having funding, expensive for someone with many prior violations). One colleague said this \u0026ldquo;monetization\u0026rdquo; was against the spirit of data sharing. Probably. But is it?\nMy intention of mentioning digital currencies was simply to recognize value generated by research work. For data sharing, if citations to a shared dataset with DOIs provide an \u0026ldquo;alternate currency\u0026rdquo; worth considering for tenure promotion. What else mechanisms could be created to promote and facilitate data sharing and \u0026mdash; research integrity, in general? I would argue citations might be too narrow, and not enabling enough. My citation count may signal my prior achievements and help me get funded. But how many grant proposals can I possibly write each year? And a citation count does not represent my reputation in research collaboration, data sharing, peer review, conference organization, etc. As academics, what values do we generate from our work? How to give ourselves credit (not until once in a lifetime tenure promotions)? Crazy? Maybe. But academia is outsourcing \u0026mdash; if not losing \u0026mdash; values generated by us to others \u0026ndash; for-profit publishers, data-rich startups, etc. See the fight for Open Access against the \u0026ldquo;paywall\u0026rdquo;, sometimes in dramatic unlawful manners. See our love-hate relationship with the Impact Factor or other algorithms like h-index that influence who get jobs, tenure, and grants. We can stay proud of those nicely formatted PDFs published in high Impact-Factor journals. But what other things can we care more about? If we\u0026rsquo;re not standing with various types of value generated by our work \u0026mdash; during data collect, data analysis, peer review, journal editing, etc. \u0026mdash; it\u0026rsquo;s probably a matter of time another startup or rich company to claim ownership of a piece of our work.\nIf ten years later learning is earning (see the video below), I predict data sharing, and other value generation or value sharing activities in scholarly research, will also be recognized \u0026mdash; not necessarily with money but with something that can more holistically represent the value of our work and can be used/transacted to enable further scholarly activities.\n \nFinally, my heartfelt thanks to our leaders \u0026mdash; esp. Dr. Felice levine from AERA and Drs. Susan Yoon, Jan van Aalst \u0026amp; Bill Sandoval from ISLS \u0026mdash; in engaging me in this exciting and rewarding journey. I look forward to working further on data sharing and in various inter-related areas.\n","date":1501113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501113600,"objectID":"0bb420005b8ee495e5fa78cebd12a1c4","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2017-07-27-data-sharing-workshop-2/","publishdate":"2017-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-07-27-data-sharing-workshop-2/","section":"post","summary":"Story continued, after Part I.\nIn the 2.5 days of the workshop, the group continued to deepen the discussion on Data Sharing to more concrete and practical items.

I am attending as an early career scholar from the International Society of the Learning Sciences \u0026mdash; my academic home.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s only a half-day into the workshop but I\u0026rsquo;m already amazed by so many great thoughts from a full room of journal editors, program officers from funding agencies, and early career peers. Below I\u0026rsquo;m sharing some general (not necessarily representative) themes of ideas discussed so far at the workshop.\nData Sharing: Where Are We? In preparation for the conference, Dr. Felice J. Levine, the workshop convener from AERA, shared out the classic National Academies Report on Sharing Research Data that was released in 1985. I read it on my flight into D.C. and it was a worth read. What stroke me was: many thoughts I compiled in preparation of the workshop were already elaborated in this 32-year-old report. The value of data sharing is not newly recognized. Many challenges have persisted.\nBefore reading this report, I happened to read a much newer article titled Administrative social science data: The challenge of reproducible research published in Big Data \u0026amp; Society \u0026mdash; a journal I reviewed for. There are some clear advancements the social science communities (and scholarly communities in general) have made since 1985. For instance, we have various research tools and platforms available these days to facilitate data management, sharing, and publishing. Git \u0026mdash; a version control system highly recommended by this article \u0026mdash; was nonexistent when the National Academies Report came out; neither were platforms and initiatives such as Open Science Framework, Harvard Dataverse Network, and Figshare. However, when juxtaposing challenges discussed in both pieces, what stroke me \u0026mdash; again \u0026mdash; was how slow it has been to shift academic cultures to promote data sharing. Indeed, developing tools are easier, whereas changing cultures at many levels \u0026mdash; e.g., in research labs, departments and colleges, institutions, associations, funding agencies \u0026mdash; are much much more difficult.\nDiscussion Themes Perspectives from these two pieces were echoed in a round of self-intros at the workshop this afternoon. Below are some keywords I noted, which again, reflect my own bias.\nData. One important point was made about what we mean by data. This is not only about the traditional dichotomy of qualitative vs. quantitative data, but also \u0026mdash; purposes of data, power relations in data and data systems (e.g., whom are served by data), shapes of data, etc. I recently wrote in an invited think piece in Chinese about how the term data (数据) originally meant punishing people in ancient Chinese. In the same vein, one colleague commented on the word research being dirty to Indigenous peoples. These views apply here in educational research data as well and therefore in data sharing.\nContexts of research data are also extremely important. Data shared without sufficient information about their context are useless. This fact places burden on both initial investigators who share data (because they need to explain the context in prep for data sharing) and secondary analysts who need to understand the context (often based on insufficient documentation). More work is probably needed to further unpack data, and to articulate data that are shareable, situations where data are meaningful to be shared, and constituents of shared data.\nCulture and practices. I believe this topic was mostly discussed so far. Subtopics include incentives and disincentives related to data sharing, which are explored in depth in the National Academies Report. For an assistant professor like me, for example, the current tenure process does not credit my investment in data sharing or data publishing. Even if I publish a dataset with a DOI attached to it, it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t carry the same weight as an empirical piece in a top journal. An editor mentioned it\u0026rsquo;s also considered \u0026ldquo;suboptimal\u0026rdquo; for someone\u0026rsquo;s tenure case to publish a study based on secondary data. While there is currently less credit given to data sharing practices, disincentives abound, which are also elaborated in the National Academies Report. Therefore, data sharing does not only need a few mavericks but systematic investments to incentify and sustain culture changes.\nEthics. Another major concern was ethical challenges related to data sharing. It was refreshing to hear from one senior colleague sharing that patients whose data were collected for medical research were eager to have their data shared, because they wished to contribute to the quest for a cure, while laws and ethics guidelines prohibit sharing of personal health data. For me as an early career scholar, I tend to make \u0026ldquo;the minimal ask\u0026rdquo; when preparing my IRB protocols \u0026mdash; only because the IRB work with an IRB office and a school district is already so daunting for someone who\u0026rsquo;s still navigating the systems. I worry that being ambitious in data sharing would undermine the likelihood of getting research protocols approved. In addition to putting a sentence to a journal\u0026rsquo;s homepage saying \u0026ldquo;you should share your data\u0026rdquo;, we need additional resources to help scholars deal with ethical challenges even before a study is conducted.\nInfrastructure. Numerous initiatives have emerged to support data sharing, and open science in general. I look forward to experts who are in the forefront of these matters to share their work. For example, colleagues from the Center for Open Science, which has developed systems like the Open Science Framework and OSF Preprints, will present tomorrow. As an advocate of open science, I am also intrigued by recent work by writing \u0026amp; preprint platforms like Authorea and code sharing platforms like Code Ocean which do not only allow sharing of Research Objects but more interactive forms of scholarly discourse \u0026amp; content consumption (e.g., interactive visualizations linked with shared data and directly embedded in publications). So, technically we are (almost) there.\nValue. At the dinner table, it was refreshing to hear from senior scholars how they had to mail out their manuscripts when submitting to a journal and how they needed to fax their reviews to a journal/conference. At that time, the manuscript was almost the only thing others can see from someone\u0026rsquo;s work. We talked about how we can now assign value to so many \u0026ldquo;middle-products\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;byproducts\u0026rdquo; of academic research in addition to an article as an end-product. This is linked to a point made in my last blog post about the need to expand valuation in education to include artifacts generated in learning processes. After reading emerging, draft guidelines that encourage and, in some cases, enforce citations of shared data, I\u0026rsquo;m increasingly optimistic about new cultures of research and publishing that are yet to come.\nStay tuned.\nResources  Fienberg, S.

I don’t know for sure how good a water buffalo handler she [Lady Gaga] could be, but I am quite sure she will not be able to run on bumpy muddy paths with 200 pounds of sweet potatoes dangling on each end of a bamboo pole.\n(See If Lady Gaga Can be Useful\u0026hellip;)\n The village I grew up happens to be only ~20 miles away from Zhao\u0026rsquo;s. And the situation was the same. As a matter of fact, my grandparents never learned to handle a water buffalo. When it came the season to plow the fields, they had to hire experts \u0026mdash; a situation that could be tough when the only buffalo became fully booked. And as picky farmers, they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to hire any random, potentially lousy buffalo handlers, who might plow shallowly (to save the buffalo\u0026rsquo;s energy) and jeopardize the harvest of a whole year. Indeed, for my grandparents\u0026rsquo; generation in the village, knowing how to handle a water buffalo was valuable, more valuable than going to schools.\nThings changed for my parents\u0026rsquo; generation. They saw growing value of formal education. My dad became the first one of his generation in the family to enter a \u0026ldquo;teacher\u0026rsquo;s school\u0026rdquo; (equivalent to high school) and to land a teaching job with a monthly paycheck. My mom went to high school but narrowly missed college. What became remarkable in their careers was the value of a diploma, with which my dad went on to work as a teacher, received additional training, and is now leading a small team in a local educational department. My mom, with \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; a high-school diploma, has been teaching for decades but is not recognized as a formal member of the teaching force. The differences a diploma could make came up a million times at our dinner table. So my parents\u0026rsquo; shared dream was to send me to college \u0026mdash; to get an even better diploma from a much bigger place.\nThe pursuit for advanced degrees became exactly what my generation was all about. While my parents could not fully invest in schoolwork because they had to take care of their families, my generation was generally sucked into homework and crazy amounts of standardized tests. I did get a high-school diploma like my mom and ventured 2,000 miles to Beijing for a college degree, which led me to opportunities of doing what I\u0026rsquo;m doing \u0026mdash; a huge privilege for a kid whose dream was as big and as far as going to college.\nFrom handling a water buffalo to holding a respected diploma/degree, what is seen as valuable, or having value, has dramatically shifted across three generations in my family. If formal education is conceptualized as an activity leading to an outcome. For my grandparents, the outcome was not as valuable as being able to handle a water buffalo. For my parents and myself, the outcome was a diploma, certificate or degree, which accreditates knowledge as \u0026ldquo;entities\u0026rdquo; passed onto us through education and entitles us to work on certain jobs or to pursuit new goals.\nNow, what will happen for my son\u0026rsquo;s generation?\nIt could be possible when my son graduates from college, there is no or very few jobs. This is not being pessimist about the economy, but a reality check given the rise of automation and artificial intelligence. As a report published by McKinsey claims, automation and artificial intelligence could readily carry out 45% of paid activities across the U.S. economy, influencing about 60% of all occupations. While routine tasks in manufacturing, transportation and food service is already being automated, jobs requiring creativity and emotions are where humanity will be seeking meaningful work in the foreseeable future [1]. Even if technical feasibility of automation does not guarantee adoption, education \u0026mdash; which has been (partially) charged with workforce preparation \u0026mdash; is facing hard questions. What if an education does not lead to a job, because there is no, or not enough, jobs? Are curriculum standards limiting the scope of education to areas that would be soon automated? How the \u0026ldquo;achievement gap\u0026rdquo; will be re-lived (not relieved) in an era when the meaning of achievement will be fundamentally redefined?\nWe are enduring another \u0026mdash; and maybe even bigger \u0026mdash; shift in valuation in education and learning. For my grandparents, formal education was irrelevant and learning in schools was too detached from their daily lives. What mattered for them was learning knowledge in-use and of practical value, like handling a water buffalo, which was not valued in education. This situation changed for my parents\u0026rsquo; and my generation, as formal accreditations from educational institutions are not only relevant but connected to social mobility more than ever before. Degrees, certificates and transcripts given by respected institutions are trusted accreditation of acquired knowledge and skills valued by curriculum standards. With a teaching certificate, my dad became eligible to teach. With a university degree, many doors opened for me. These credentials carry great amounts of value and trust \u0026mdash; not determined by learners and educational institutions, but the broader changing societal landscape.\nHowever, one issue with this model is these credentials mark the endpoints of educational experiences which are put in a \u0026ldquo;black box\u0026rdquo; for outsiders and are not consistently regarded by the credentialing process in different societies, institutions, departments, or even different iterations of a same course. And yet a same GPA from a same school is equivalently valued, because it is the only thing that gets valued and remains visible after a learning journey is \u0026ldquo;done.\u0026rdquo; Things that get produced in learning towards these credentials are largely disregarded and discarded during credentialing; in most cases, they are not seen as generating value at all.\nIt is only quite recently in new cultures of learning [2], where artifacts generated in learning are more recognized. Exciting projects are emerging, e.g., Open Badges and the newer Transcripts on blockchain, which open up new ways to credit learning. Specifically, we can now credit a broader range of learner achievements, democratize the practice of credentialing, and give learners stronger control over their credentials. However, in many cases a new technology is adopted to embrace an old educational model \u0026mdash; or more precisely an old valuation model that disregards learning in-situ or knowledge that exists in flows of participation, collaboration, and authentic problem-solving. If automation and artificial intelligence are taking away jobs, and if future generations can only find meaningful work at the \u0026ldquo;creative end,\u0026rdquo; some larger questions regarding value and valuation need to be discussed. In the newer context of broad and deep automation, and after decades of discussing 21st century competencies:\n What should be seen as having value in learning processes? Who are entitled to the act of valuation, if not (only) traditional institutions? After valuation, how would value be presented? And to whom? Will future learners get paid to learn? Or for what they produce \u0026mdash; such as artifacts, meaningful social connections, something contributing to public goods \u0026mdash; in learning processes? What are the roles of a curriculum? How equatable opportunities could be ensured given existing gaps and new divides introduced by any new valuation model?  I am curious about your responses to these bizarre or maybe unanswerable questions.\nNotes\n [1] Sources from McKinsey Quarterly: Where machines could replace humans—and where they can’t (yet), and Four fundamentals of workplace automation.

The whole world \u0026ndash; or all Reddit users \u0026ndash; were given a 999 x 999 blank canvas to draw on. Some simple rules apply:\n Each user could choose one pixel from 16 colors to place anywhere on the canvas. They could place as many pixels of as many colors as they wanted, but they had to wait a few minutes between placing each one. (source)\n During the following 72 hours, amazingly interesting things happened on this 999 x 999 canvas. Below is a gif that gives you a glimpse into what had happened. Numerous accounts of this event have been posted. See this post for a good overview, and more posts can be found at the Reddit Place itself.\nGraphing the Reddit Place with Neo4j The Reddit Place as a web-based social phenomenon will be remembered and studied by many people. I didn\u0026rsquo;t follow this event at all but was amazed by the various types of participating users, sub-communities who self-organized to achieve certain goals, clashes and fights, evolving rules, impressive artworks, and so on \u0026ndash; all that happened on this little canvas. I\u0026rsquo;m especially intrigued by the emergent, self-organizing processes of constructing, destructing, negotiating, and re-constructing among numerous users and user networks supported by all kinds of communication tools (mostly Reddit itself).\nWith a data dump that captured the history of this event, I could not resist myself from playing with it using Neo4j.\nImporting data To begin with, I wrote the following Cypher scripts to import the csv dump into Neo4j:\n{% highlight cypher %} // Set constraints CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Point) ASSERT p.location IS UNIQUE; CREATE INDEX ON :User(name);\n// Insert data USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000 LOAD CSV FROM \u0026ldquo;file:///export.csv\u0026rdquo; AS l WITH l, [toInt(l[1]), toInt(l[2])] AS loc WHERE l[3] IS NOT NULL MERGE (p:Point {location: loc}) ON CREATE SET p.location = loc, p.count = 1 ON MATCH SET p.count = p.count + 1 MERGE (u:User {name: l[3]}) ON CREATE SET u.name = l[3], u.count = 1 ON MATCH SET u.count = u.count + 1 MERGE (u)-[r:PAINT]-\u0026gt;(p) ON CREATE SET r.count = 1, r.ids = [toInt(l[0])], r.colors = [toInt(l[4])], r.times = [toInt(l[5])] ON MATCH SET r.count = r.count + 1, r.ids = r.ids + toInt(l[0]), r.colors = r.colors + toInt(l[4]), r.times = r.times + toInt(l[5]); {% endhighlight %}\nThe figure below demonstrates the graph model of the created Neo4j graph database. The model is quite simple and intuitive, including two node types named User and Point and one relationship type named Paint.\nIt took my computer ~22 minutes to create 1.6 million labels, 1.6 million nodes, 28.8 million properties, and 4.13 million relationships in this graph database, the size of which ended up to be 4.30 GB.\nGeneral queries After data were loaded, I did some quick queries.\nFirst, who were the most active users? User itsnotlupus won the game as s/he painted for 177 times. This may not sound much but if you multiple 177 by 5 minutes (the \u0026lsquo;cooldown\u0026rsquo; time), you will find the user spent roughly 15 hours painting or contemplating the next pixel on the canvas. This time amount does not include activities in other communication tools.\nWhere did itsnotlupus paint? Below is a graph showing this user (in the center) and 100 pixels s/he painted on. Note that each pixel is identified by its coordinates in the 2D canvas.\nI noticed this user painted a whole lot near Point [380, 880]. By clicking on the [380, 881] Point node, see below, I could check who else have painted on that spot. 16 other users have painted there. Maybe there were some interesting collisions on that single pixel?\nWhich colors did itsnotlupus use? It appeared itsnotlupus painted #E59500 for 104 times, and #E50000 for 70 times. Do those two colors belong to specific clans itsnotlupus was affiliated with?\n{% highlight cypher %} MATCH (u:User {name: \u0026ldquo;itsnotlupus\u0026rdquo;})-[r:PAINT]-\u0026gt;() WITH collect(r.colors) as colors UNWIND colors as array UNWIND array as color RETURN color, count(color) as count ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10 {% endhighlight %}\nThe Blue Corner Based on this post, the lower-right corner was occupied by Blue. So I checked the corner pixel [999, 999]. The following Cypher query returned a total of 10,121 user actions on that single pixel. The figure that follows shows 100 of those users who painted at [999, 999].\n{% highlight cypher %} MATCH (p:Point {location: [999, 999]})\u0026lt;-[r:PAINT]-() RETURN count(r) {% endhighlight %}\nTop painters in that corner are listed in the figure below. Querying the top [999, 999] painter MrMeltJr I found him painting blue (#0000EA) predominantly (105 out of 116 times). He was clearly a member of the Blue Corner sub-community.\nWhat was the most used color in that corner? The following query found the most dominant color to be #0000EA, which appeared for 7400 times, followed by #820080's 2055 times. This finding could be confirmed by the gif above.\n{% highlight cypher %} MATCH (p:Point {location: [999, 999]})\u0026lt;-[r:PAINT]-() WITH collect(r.colors) as allColors UNWIND allColors as array UNWIND array as color RETURN color, count(color) as count ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10 {% endhighlight %}\nMore Fun to Come These queries are far from even scratching the surface of the complex social phenomenon. Two aspects I\u0026rsquo;m especially interested in exploring (if I have time) are the temporal aspect of user actions on single pixels and the spacial aspect of changes with neighboring pixels. In addition, it would also be useful if we could connect communication and coordination among users and communities external to the canvas.\nYes, now I see the April Fool\u0026rsquo;s Day could be fun!\n","date":1491782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491782400,"objectID":"229246857bba35a20921b7862a7dca88","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/post/2017-04-10-graphing-reddit-place/","publishdate":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-04-10-graphing-reddit-place/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ver never liked the April Fool\u0026rsquo;s Day, until this year when Reddit decided to launch a social experiment called Reddit Place.\nThe idea is simple.

:)\n写到这里时，你又在那里开始用力地敲击玩具琴键。每敲击一下，你就能听到一小段音乐，一直敲击音乐就能串联起来成一首曲子。但是对你来说最有意思的是琴键上方的那一小排分别标有小动物头像的按钮，敲击他们会发出各种动物的叫声。你顾不了音乐，乐此不疲地敲击小动物们。或许你正在建立动物和他们叫声的联系吧。像你的“同类们”一样，你有何尝不是充满哲学性的婴儿呢？\n","date":1419573600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1419573600,"objectID":"a92de3351c9071274f515f7cf1c416c7","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/zh/2014-12-26-philosophical-baby-2/","publishdate":"2014-12-26T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/zh/2014-12-26-philosophical-baby-2/","section":"zh","summary":"锵锵，在我写系列之一时，你刚刚半个月。如今整整七个月过去了，你已经长成一个眼睛四处观察、嘴里牙牙乱语的机灵小伙儿。之所以现在才写第二篇，一方面是因为繁忙，另一方面则因为时常被一个问题叨扰：“眼前这个常无理取闹的家伙真的是充满哲学性的婴儿吗？”\n","tags":["Baby"],"title":"哲学性的婴儿之二：因果链接","type":"zh"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"不知从何时开始，网上开始流传各种卓略的父母如何机智地教育自己孩子的段子。段子的模式通常是这样的：孩子犯了个错误，父亲或母亲机智点拨，孩子人生观瞬间升华。\n不知是因为个人对小孩创新的研究兴趣、还是个性批判和叛逆，每每我听到这类段子总会起一身鸡皮疙瘩。我不禁会问：有多少父母这样俯视自己的孩子？有多少父母一生都如此俯视自己的孩子？让父母像大人的学习的段子去哪里了？\n《圣经》的马太福音中有个小故事：有一天，门徒们问耶稣，在天国里谁最伟大？耶稣找来了一个小孩子，指着孩子对门徒们说：你们若不变得像小孩子那样天真，就进不了天国。\n而事实上，孩子能让父母学习的地方远非“很傻很天真”

vs. 学术伦理","type":"zh"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 这是一个极其复杂和难辩的题目，不过最近有幸读了一些有关教育改革的文章，索性也胡乱说一说。\n“现代课程理论”和“现代教学测量”之父泰勒在接受一个采访时提到，他很庆幸他所在的国家的联邦政府、州政府把大量有关课程的教育决策权“下放”到通常以学区为单位的学校委员会（school board），学校委员会有时还会进一步把修改课程的权力进一步下放到学校。这里用下放这个词在一些人眼里是不正确的，因为课程理论研究了这么多年，对于课程应该源于哪里，教育的目的应该是什么从未有定见。泰勒眼里的教育是通过让个人接受普世价值而让这个社会粘合在一起，因此强调教育的社会功能。而研究权力理论的人会把教育看作是掌权者用来继续维持他们权力的工具。后现代思潮中的学者或许会更强调教育的多重性和文化相关性，认为课程要融入目标群体的文化特性。相比这种分散式的教育/课程决策体系，集中式的、至上而下的教育决策体系也在一些国家存在，如俄罗斯、中国、法国和二战前夕的德国。泰勒在上个世纪六七十年代分别到访过莫斯科和北京，他描述的情形和我经历的教育完全是吻合的。看来在我们经历的自上而下的教育体系中，教育变革的幅度是比较小的，速度是比较慢的。\n那么如泰勒描述的那种分权、去中心化模式是否能带来大量的变革呢？另一位学者库班在1988年的一篇文章里给出了否定的答案。他分析美国20世纪的教育改革，发现依然只有少量的成功的教育变革。对于教育改革，他做了一个类比。美国航天局1986年1月28日发射的“挑战者号”航天飞机在发射后73秒后坠毁，7名航天员全部遇难。在之后的调查中，美国航天局主要从“飞船设计失误”和“质量控制”两个方面找原因，试图找到改善现状的方法。库班认为教育改革通常也是如此。与“飞船及发射质量控制”和“飞船基本设计”两个方面相对应，他把教育变革分为两类：“一级变革”和“二级变革”。一级变革指的是在不对现有系统伤筋动骨的基础上，尝试去让现有系统更有效、更具效率。对于飞船事故来说，就是去看是否在某些细小环节上存在瑕疵，并努力去修正它。二级变革则不同，它通常是去寻找整个系统设计的缺陷，是对系统的大幅度的修正。对于飞船来说就是去看是否是因为整体设计上的失误导致了这次事故。对应到教育领域中，库班认为之所以过去一个世纪里的教育在工业时代建立起来的学校体系的基础上没有大的变化，是因为这个世纪里取得成功的教育改革大多多是“一级变革”，而只有很少的“二级变革”取得了成功。\n那么为什么那么多的教育改革失败了呢？他认为一个很重要的原因是大量教育变革都把改变教师行为作为一个重要的目标，而很多改革的主导者却并没有真正去理解一个教师在学校里每天最基本的实践是什么，没有去认真分析改革情境里的一些现状，最后遭到了包括很多教师和学校领导在内的抵抗。几天前读到深圳一位一线教师转发的一篇叫做“教师很疲惫”的文章，描述教师对于一些社会部门“进校园活动”疲于奔命，而不能把更多精力投入到教学思考的现状。文中提到这些社会部门的进校园活动为学校安排了多达18门在国家课程计划规定之外的课程，其中有很多重复和冗余，耗费了师生的大量精力。暂不谈这些“进校园活动”的动机到底是某些部门的面子工程，还是真的是在响应“校本课程”的号召，单就教师的反应来看，这个变革就已经失败了。或许这不是一个关于改变教师行为的例子，但却体现了目前我们在进行的一些如火如荼的变革中，在我们的自上而下的模式里缺少一种对现实情境的具体分析。\n另一个决定“二级变革”是否成功的关键是改革是否能获得社会、立法和政府部门的支持。从2002年麻省理工大学（MIT）尝试开放该校的课程开始，开放教育资源运动已经席卷全球。中国也有我们自己的全国范围内巨大规模的“精品课程”项目。开放教育资源运动除了有广泛的社会需求（让更多的人获得名牌高校的教育资源）之外，还有大量科研基金会及政府政策导引的支持。因此这是一个目前来看取得很大成功的“二级变革”。同时，几天前我也读到了南方人物周刊上有关国内教育技术界的大师、北师大何克抗教授的“跨越式项目”的报道。根据报道，虽然项目在研究上获得了很多数据去证明它的成功，却因迟迟不能获得高层领导的支持而陷入困境。\n比库班更早的一篇发表于1972年的文章分析了在那之前75年内美国发生的各种教育改革。有别于库班的那篇思辨性文章，这篇文章从分析这些教育改革的多项特性出发去分析影响教育改革成败的因素。这些特性包括改革的年代（1950年前还是后）、起因来自教育系统内部还是外部、变革关注什么领域（教学/课程/组织和管理）、以及对改革成效的打分。文章通过一系列分析得出的结果与库班的论点有很多吻合之处。比如，这篇文章的作者也认为如果一个教育改革要求教师抛弃现有的实践方式而接受一种全新的时间方式，那么这项改革就有更大失败的危险。同时，一项改革给人们带来的认知负担会影响这项改革的成效能否长期维持下去。他们也发现由外部发起的变革比从教育内部发起的变革成功率更高。此外他们还提到如果缺少一个扩散系统，改革也很容易流产。\n了解这些现实或许会让迫切希望变革的人被关起来。但与此同时，理解这些因素对于教育改革又是十分重要的。我也发现，无论是在一种自上而下还是自下而上的体系中，获得包括立法、社会和政府等各种力量的支持对于教育改革的成败起着巨大的作用（对于中国，这三个因素的顺序应该倒过来——政府、社会和立法，因为我们目前是一种大政府小社会的体系）。我们一直在抱怨教育，我们也有很多如何教授那样一心想要改变教育的人在努力，可现实是我们由中央组织教育专家制定的改革纲要通过“粗壮”但却“笨重”的自上而下的渠道传播逐级失真，而“纤细瘦弱”的自下而上的渠道经常会被切断。这也解释了为什么把2001年的颁布的基础教育课程改革纲要拿到现在来看，你会以为是今年刚颁布的新的改革纲要，因为里边的很多内容在10之后去看还只能是理想。到头来，对教育改革的认识，还是要回到对“教育是什么”的问题上来。\n","date":1291010400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1291010400,"objectID":"1d70e3092300a0b7598006a73eb1107f","permalink":"https://meefen.github.io/zh/2010-11-29-education-reforms/","publishdate":"2010-11-29T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/zh/2010-11-29-education-reforms/","section":"zh","summary":"
